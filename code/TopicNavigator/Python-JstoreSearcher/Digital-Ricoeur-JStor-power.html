  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Abstract: Any study purporting to examine slave power conspiracy rhetoric in the political mainstream must consider the case of Abraham Lincoln. Salmon Chase and Charles Sumner were important national and local Republican leaders in their own right, but even they were deemed too radical to be serious presidential candidates in 1860. In contrast to comparative radicals like Seward, Chase, and Sumner, by 1860 Lincoln appeared to be a quite moderate candidate who was likely to appeal to the broadest spectrum of voters. Lincoln, in sum, was the ʺembodiment of availability.ʺ¹ As such, Lincolnʹs conspiracy texts are worthy of serious attention in<br>

  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: Two forms of taxidermy predominate in the popular imagination: the type specimen in the natural history museum and the severed-head–style hunting trophy. In the case of the museum specimen, taxidermic animals stand in for their species; single animals serve as representatives of whole populations. In the tradition of the “Father of Modern Taxidermy” Carl Akeley, the aesthetic of the museum specimen minimizes differences between individuals (such as bullet wounds and other surface blemishes) to maximize an animal’s emblematic power; according to Donna Haraway, such taxidermy makes “nature true to type.”¹ In the case of hunting trophies, taxidermic animals represent<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Abstract: “Hermeneutical rhetoric” is the counterpart of Steven Mailloux’s “rhetorical hermeneutics.” In an article bearing that title and more extensively in his book
                  Rhetorical Power, Mailloux offers an “antitheory theory” of interpretation that situates literary hermeneutics within the context of rhetorical exchange.¹ Traditional literary theory, Mailloux argues, relies upon a general conception of interpretation as the basis for justifying particular interpretative acts. Such “theory” takes two forms—“textual realism,” where meaning is found in the text, and “readerly idealism,” where meaning is made through intersubjective agreements among a community of interpreters. As theories, these positions are diametrically opposed, but, Mailloux maintains,<br>

  Abstract: In considering languages of grief in relation to languages of certainty, there is a tension in the ways death can be thought of in connection to modern knowledge. On the one hand, we can consider death as that which underlies the possibility of knowledge, as that end point to the fostering or disallowing of life that stands for the modern configuration of power/knowledge (as Foucault [1978] had it). And on the other hand, we can imagine death as that which cannot be spoken in languages of modernity (as de Certeau [1986] suggested). Put differently, this is the distinction between death<br>

  Book Title: The Language of the Gods in the World of Men-Sanskrit, Culture, and Power in Premodern India<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Pollock Sheldon<br>
  Abstract: In this work of impressive scholarship, Sheldon Pollock explores the remarkable rise and fall of Sanskrit, India's ancient language, as a vehicle of poetry and polity. He traces the two great moments of its transformation: the first around the beginning of the Common Era, when Sanskrit, long a sacred language, was reinvented as a code for literary and political expression, the start of an amazing career that saw Sanskrit literary culture spread from Afghanistan to Java. The second moment occurred around the beginning of the second millennium, when local speech forms challenged and eventually replaced Sanskrit in both the literary and political arenas. Drawing striking parallels, chronologically as well as structurally, with the rise of Latin literature and the Roman empire, and with the new vernacular literatures and nation-states of late-medieval Europe,
      The Language of the Gods in the World of Menasks whether these very different histories challenge current theories of culture and power and suggest new possibilities for practice.<br>

  Abstract: One particular mode of theorizing and explaining culture implicitly rejects, or is entirely indifferent to, both culture’s evolutionary development and its purely instrumental contribution to power. Instead, culture is viewed as something just there, and as ever self-identical. It is considered outside the flux of time, whether natural or political, or else endowed with so deep a history as to appear forever beyond time. And its stance in relationship to power is presumed to be almost one of consanguinity, certainly not that of an object to be deployed at the will of power.<br>

  Abstract: Challenges to ethnographic authority and to the ethics of representation have led many contemporary anthropologists to abandon fieldwork in favor of strategies of theoretical puppeteering, textual analysis, and surrogate ethnography. In
      Being There,John Borneman and Abdellah Hammoudi argue that ethnographies based on these strategies elide important insights. To demonstrate the power and knowledge attained through the fieldwork experience, they have gathered essays by anthropologists working in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tanzania, the Canadian Arctic, India, Germany, and Russia that shift attention back to the subtle dynamics of the ethnographic encounter. From an Inuit village to the foothills of Kilimanjaro, each account illustrates how, despite its challenges, fieldwork yields important insights outside the reach of textual analysis.<br>

  Abstract: This essay examines the relation of presence in fieldwork to interlocution. Within anthropology in the past several decades, two kinds of criticisms of the fieldwork encounter have had particular resonance: that fieldwork experience and presence do not generate any unique knowledge and that the power/dominance of the (Western) ethnographer ethically taints the knowledge derived from encounters. The questioning of the ethnographer’s presence has frequently led to text-based reading being substituted for fieldwork experience, with a corresponding focus on textual representation; the questioning of the ethnographer’s power has led to demands for collaboration and dialogue, which in turn often emphasize righteous<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Modernity-Concepts of Nature in Japanese Political Ideology<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Julia Adeney<br>
  Abstract: Julia Adeney Thomas turns the concept of nature into a powerful analytical lens through which to view Japanese modernity, bringing the study of both Japanese history and political modernity to a new level of clarity. She shows that nature necessarily functions as a political concept and that changing ideas of nature's political authority were central during Japan's transformation from a semifeudal world to an industrializing colonial empire. In political documents from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, nature was redefined, moving from the universal, spatial concept of the Tokugawa period, through temporal, social Darwinian ideas of inevitable progress and competitive struggle, to a celebration of Japan as a nation uniquely in harmony with nature. The so-called traditional "Japanese love of nature" masks modern state power. Thomas's theoretically sophisticated study rejects the supposition that modernity is the ideological antithesis of nature, overcoming the determinism of the physical environment through technology and liberating denatured subjects from the chains of biology and tradition. In making "nature" available as a critical term for political analysis, this book yields new insights into prewar Japan's failure to achieve liberal democracy, as well as an alternative means of understanding modernity and the position of non-Western nations within it.<br>

  Book Title: Controlling Contested Places-Late Antique Antioch and the Spatial Politics of Religious Controversy<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Shepardson Christine<br>
  Abstract: From constructing new buildings to describing rival-controlled areas as morally and physically dangerous, leaders in late antiquity fundamentally shaped their physical environment and thus the events that unfolded within it.
      Controlling Contested Placesmaps the city of Antioch (Antakya, Turkey) through the topographically sensitive vocabulary of cultural geography, demonstrating the critical role played by physical and rhetorical spatial contests during the tumultuous fourth century. Paying close attention to the manipulation of physical places, Christine Shepardson exposes some of the powerful forces that structured the development of religious orthodoxy and orthopraxy in the late Roman Empire.Theological claims and political support were not the only significant factors in determining which Christian communities gained authority around the Empire. Rather, Antioch's urban and rural places, far from being an inert backdrop against which events transpired, were ever-shifting sites of, and tools for, the negotiation of power, authority, and religious identity. This book traces the ways in which leaders like John Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Libanius encouraged their audiences to modify their daily behaviors and transform their interpretation of the world (and landscape) around them. Shepardson argues that examples from Antioch were echoed around the Mediterranean world, and similar types of physical and rhetorical manipulations continue to shape the politics of identity and perceptions of religious orthodoxy to this day.<br>

  Abstract: For over a century, the relationships between the humanities and the sciences have been largely defined by opposition:

  Abstract: The previous chapter highlighted some of the shared themes and influences between hermeneutical theory and the problem of doctrinal development throughout their respective histories. The present chapter begins to build a more constructive case, utilizing the insights of evangelical scholars engaged in conversation with contemporary hermeneutical theory for constructing a hermeneutical model of doctrinal development. Here, we will explore the theological hermeneutics of Anglican New Testament scholar and theologian Anthony C. Thiselton, whose descriptive approach to theological hermeneutics has remarkable explanatory power for the phenomenon of growing doctrinal traditions.<br>

  Book Title: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges-Men and Women of Valor<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Yoder John C.<br>
  Abstract: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges studies political culture and behavior in premonarchic Israel, focusing on the protagonists in the book of Judges. Although the sixth-century BCE Deuteronomistic editor portrayed them as moral champions and called them “judges,” the original bardic storytellers and the men and women of valor themselves were preoccupied with the problem of gaining and maintaining political power. These “mighty ones” were ambitious, at times ruthless; they might be labeled chiefs, strongmen, or even warlords in today’s world. John C. Yoder considers the variety of strategies the men and women of valor used to gain and consolidate their power, including the use of violence, the redistribution of patronage, and the control of the labor and reproductive capacity of subordinates. They relied heavily, however, on other strategies that did not deplete their wealth or require the constant exercise of force: mobilizing and dispensing indigenous knowledge, cultivating a reputation for reliability and honor, and positioning themselves as skillful mediators between the realms of earth and heaven, using their association with YHWH to advance their political, economic, or military agenda.<br>

  Abstract: Neglected by secular scholars because of its religious content, reshaped by people of faith because its protagonists are morally offensive, and avoided by individuals committed to nonviolence because of its brutality, the book of Judges deserves to be taken more seriously. No other book in the Hebrew Bible mirrors the entire span of Israel’s history as authentically as Judges. The main body of the book is a collection of premonarchic tales celebrating heroic champions, who competed for power in turbulent times. The book’s sixth-century version reflects the tension between the priestly Deuteronomic reformers and the Deuteronomistic defenders of royal power.¹<br>

  Abstract: Milton’s sonnets are political not because they praise and advise political figures, comment on historical events, or surreptitiously air concerns about aristocratic patronage, but because they strike at the heart of the Petrarchan tradition’s devotion to an absolutist theory of power predicated on the temporal deferral of fulfillment. They accomplish this revolt by insisting that sonnets contain events, instead of simply reporting on the already past happening of those events or advocating for or prophesying their future occurrence. In this sense, Milton’s sonnets attempt to treat events as free happenings in the present, as opposed to an impotent retrospective postulation<br>

Acknowledging the evidential traces that all significant events leave behind, the preceding essays in this volume make memory’s credibility more evident. How ironic it is that so much ink has been spilled on social memory’s incidental functions—the forgetting or ignoring of wrongdoing, legitimating and challenging power, exaggerating and underestimating beneficent acts, giving voice to the marginalized—while its major function, to bring us into more direct contact with the past, the very capacity that gives memory its survival value, has led to nothing significant in the way of theoretical explication.<br>

It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F.

Instead, it is the lackluster record of science in addressing the multi-layered world in which we live—one to which Dewey attributes purpose and passion—that leads him to seek a<br>

The latter emerged in the dazzling architectonic of the creator of pragmaticism and the greater triadic tradition of semiotics, Charles Sanders Peirce—overpowering the subsequent dyadic semiological trajectory inspired by Saussure.

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

Historically, however, this is a real question, and one bearing on faith and ideology. To take an obvious instance, the correspondences invoked so often in Donne’s writing are to us metaphoric fiction, but as extensions of a single, celestial power, hence valid and real parallels, they presumably meant more for Donne and his immediate audience, even in their more skeptical moments.

  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib~<br>

  Book Title: The Tears of Sovereignty: Perspectives of Power in Renaissance Drama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LORENZ PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: A comparative study of the representation of sovereignty in paradigmatic plays of early modernity, The Tears of Sovereignty argues that the great playwrights of the period--William Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, and Calderon de la Barca--reconstitute the metaphors through which contemporary theorists continue to conceive the problems of sovereignty. The book focuses in particular on the ways the logics of these metaphors inform sovereignty's conceptualization as a "body of power." Each chapter is organized around a key tropological operation performed on that "body," from the analogical relations invoked in Richard II, through the metaphorical transfers staged in Measure for Measure to the autoimmune resistances they produce in Lope's Fuenteovejuna, and, finally, the allegorical returns of Calderon's Life is a Dream and Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. The "tears" of sovereignty are the exegetical tropes produced and performed on the English stages and Spanish corrales of the seventeenth century through which we continue to view sovereignty today.<br>

                  Life Is a Dream(La vida es Sueño) (1635) has been described as the “ultimate work of theatrical theology.”¹ Considered one of the most philosophically complex works of the early modern period,Life Is a Dreamnot only raises theological and political questions of power, but it also poses epistemological and ontological challenges to thought, particularly in relation to the increasingly sophisticated representational capacities of baroque theater. Like Suárez, in Jean-François Courtine’s account, and against a long-standing tradition that views the Jesuit playwright as a bastion of Spanish conservatism, Calderón, too, could be viewed as a<br>

  Abstract: The vision of the self that emerges from Kleist’s reading of Kantian ethics differs sharply from the figure of specular self-determination generally associated with Idealist thought. In forcing us to reconsider the assumption that language can be a medium of rational activity, Kleist seems to part company from those inheritors of Kant who accord ultimate primacy to the authority of reason. At the same time, one could argue that Kleist shares with both Kant and the Idealists a sense of the volatile power of literary language and a more general concern with the historical dimensions of artistic creation.

  Abstract: Academics and practitioners working in international economic development often cite the critical role of empowerment within development; however, relatively little attention has been paid to institutional power.¹ Institutionalized power plays an important role in generating, reinforcing, and reproducing the inequalities that prevent or limit various groups of individuals—most notably women—from acting as agents, engaging in empowerment processes, or being empowered. In other words, we cannot adequately address the role of empowerment with development without properly understanding the role of institutionalized power in empowerment.

  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Agnew John<br>
  Abstract: Hegemonytells the story of the drive to create consumer capitalism abroad through political pressure and the promise of goods for mass consumption. In contrast to the recent literature on America as empire, it explains that the primary goal of the foreign and economic policies of the United States is a world which increasingly reflects the American way of doing business, not the formation or management of an empire. Contextualizing both the Iraq war and recent plant closings in the U.S., noted author John Agnew shows how American hegemony has created a world in which power is no longer only shaped territorially. He argues in a sobering conclusion that we are consequently entering a new era of global power, one in which the world the US has made no longer works to its singular advantage.<br>

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

The link between the cross of Christ and the power of God is thus explicitly made by Paul. Consequently, one must ask whether it is possible, in a Christian theological perspective, to think about something we may call God’s “almightiness” from the event of the cross and, first, from the “word of the cross” around which the second<br>

  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary, ethnographic, contextualized, and empirical volume—with an updated introduction to take account of the dramatic events of early 2011—explores the meaning and significance of urban space, and maps the spatial inscription of power on the mega-city of Cairo. Suspicious of collective life and averse to power-sharing, Egyptian governance structures weaken but do not stop the public’s role in the remaking of their city. What happens to a city where neo-liberalism has scaled back public services and encouraged the privatization of public goods, while the vast majority cannot afford the effects of such policies? Who wins and loses in the “march to the modern and the global" as the government transforms urban spaces and markets in the name of growth, security, tourism, and modernity? How do Cairenes struggle with an ambiguous and vulnerable legal and bureaucratic environment when legality is a privilege affordable only to the few or the connected?

  Abstract: Here is a list, very incomplete, of things one should keep in mind when attempting to write seriously about zombies. Zombies do not exist. Zombies are not related to werewolves or vampires.¹ Zombies are not, literally, mindless consumers, enraged proletarians, or stupid Americans—although some were perhaps once these things—and there is little use in casting them, even metaphorically, as

  Abstract: Language has been granted too much power. The linguistic turn, the semiotic turn, the interpretative turn, the cultural turn: it seems that at every turn lately every “thing”—even materiality—is turned into a matter of language or some other form of cultural representation. The ubiquitous puns on “matter” do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them. Rather, it seems to be symptomatic of the extent to which matters of “fact” (so to speak) have been replaced with matters of signification (no scare quotes here). Language matters. Discourse matters.

  Abstract: In chapter 6 we saw that the cruciform self is not a punctual self. In this chapter I demonstrate the sense in which the cruciform self is a capable self, since capability is one of the central themes of philosophical anthropology. On Ricoeur’s definition, capability is a power or potentiality that the self is able to exercise—most basically, “the power to cause something to happen.”¹ So our question is this: What place do human agency and the power to act have in the life of faith?

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have underlined an issue that accompanies the various discourses of liberation and decolonial thought in Latin America, namely, the issue of its aesthetic dimension. As we saw, Dussel’s philosophy of liberation is based on a pre-rational and pre-linguistic sensibility, a sense of radical exteriority, that distinguishes humans. Quijano exposes a pre-rational disposition or sensibility that sustains the coloniality of power and knowledge. Moreover, as he goes on to uncover and engage ana-chronic simultaneity in Latin American existence, Quijano turns to the writers, poets, and artists of Latin America, who articulate senses of existence beyond and otherwise<br>

Not only does such care place the caregiver in unavoidable proximity to profound questions, but also the acts of care themselves reveal the nature of deeply held assumptions. Even the language that forms our descriptions of illness indicates some level of how we conceive of illness; our descriptions of illness also indicate how we understand the significance of life when it is in good health. In short, the words used for illness carry strong interpretive and evaluative power.<br>

  Book Title: Mestizaje and Globalization-Transformations of Identity and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG PHILIP D.<br>
  Abstract: The Spanish word
      mestizajedoes not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.Mestizaje and Globalizationpresents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.Mestizaje and Globalizationcontributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.<br>

The constitution of social reality is constantly being transformed, due to conflict, tensions and shifts between power(s) and counter-power(s). However, after more than five centuries of imperial, colonial and capitalist domination and exploitation, we observe that the political asymmetry, economic inequality and ethno-racial injustice have become more acute in peripheral societies.

This was, above all, the age of the Industrial Revolution. In the 1700s, profound transformations had taken place in agriculture and manufacturing, particularly in Britain. Steam power and spinning machines had become widespread, and a growing class of landless peasants and urban labourers began to make themselves heard. But greater changes were ahead.

The growth of the country’s transportation network, above all other infrastructural accomplishments undertaken by his regime, provided the most tangible example of material progress based on massive foreign investment. The year that Díaz came to power, the nation possessed only 640 kilometers of track. By 1884, the country witnessed that transportation grid expand to 5,731 kilometers and to 12,173 kilometers by 1898. In Díaz’s final year as president, 19,280 kilometers of tracks, with another 8,000 in trunk lines, crisscrossed the nation.¹ This remarkable achievement<br>

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

In the work of Gerald Murnane, idealism pertains to imaginary landscapes and the cognitive and ethical power they exert. The chapter concludes with an examination of recent Australian fiction by Michelle de Kretser and Brian Castro that continues this idealism in a more mobile and transnational mode.<br>

  Abstract: From May 1934 to June 1937, Sofía del Valle traveled the length and breadth of the United States on a mission. Mexican Catholic officials had given del Valle two fundamental tasks. First, del Valle endeavored to sway American Catholic public opinion in favor of her coreligionists in Mexico, to convince American Catholics that their brothers and sisters to the south were suffering a kind of modern-day martyrdom, mercilessly persecuted by a faction of anticlerical leaders who had risen to power in the wake of the 1910 revolution.¹ Second, del Valle’s mission was to raise as much money as possible for<br>

We speak of balanced personalities, the balance of power, balance of viewpoints represented, the balance of justice, and so on.

  Abstract: Britain, as an imperial power, dominated the world at the end of nineteenth century. Jan Morris described it succinctly as, “the largest empire in the history of the world, comprising nearly a quarter of the landmass of the earth, and a quarter of its population”.¹ Its role as a global superpower was to assert its political and economic authority, especially in Africa and Asia. The so-called Pax Britannica (British peace) was a product of this status. It was expressed profoundly in 1900 by the fact that Britain and its global interests were defended by its navy – the largest navy in<br>

  Abstract: The events of 1968, often ignorantly dismissed as no more than a year of ‘student revolt’, undermined the political certainties that had endured since 1945. In Vietnam, the world’s strongest power was proved vulnerable in face of a national liberation struggle. The Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia marked a definitive end to Moscow’s hegemony over the world’s Communist Parties. In France a general strike of over nine million workers, the biggest general strike in human history, showed that the power of the working class could not be ignored; an anti-Stalinist left that had been confined to the margins of political life<br>

  Abstract: Few serious social researchers would deny the inescapability of pondering the conundrum of class—a conundrum because, while steadily contested, politically compromised, and conceptually inflated, the unsettling suspicion keeps surfacing that class involves inequality, power, culture, exploitation, accumulation, struggle and action, being in history and the making of history, being in place and the making of space, all in the same moment. Class, power, time, and space together form a huge program that has haunted social inquiry since Marx. Disciplined social science, on the other hand, has been a recurrent escape from its embrace, and understandably so, since it is<br>

  Book Title: Critical White Studies-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stefancic Jean<br>
  Abstract: No longer content with accepting whiteness as the norm, critical scholars have turned their attention to whiteness itself. In
      Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror, numerous thinkers, including Toni Morrison, Eric Foner, Peggy McIntosh, Andrew Hacker, Ruth Frankenberg, John Howard Griffin, David Roediger, Kathleen Heal Cleaver, Noel Ignatiev, Cherrie Moraga, and Reginald Horsman, attack such questions as:*How was whiteness invented, and why?*How has the category whiteness changed over time?*Why did some immigrant groups, such as the Irish and Jews, start out as nonwhite and later became white?*Can some individual people be both white and nonwhite at different times, and what does it mean to "pass for white"?*At what point does pride in being white cross the line into white power or white supremacy?*What can whites concerned over racial inequity or white privilege do about it?Science and pseudoscience are presented side by side to demonstrate how our views on whiteness often reflect preconception, not fact. For example, most scientists hold that race is not a valid scientific category -- genetic differences between races are insignificant compared to those within them. Yet, the "one drop" rule, whereby those with any nonwhite heritage are classified as nonwhite, persists even today. As the bell curve controversy shows, race concepts die hard, especially when power and prestige lie behind them.A sweeping portrait of the emerging field of whiteness studies,Critical White Studiespresents, for the first time, the best work from sociology, law, history, cultural studies, and literature. Delgado and Stefancic expressly offer critical white studies as the next step in critical race theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do they ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to "look behind the mirror."<br>

  Abstract: A major function of racial discrimination is to facilitate the exploitation of black labor, to deny blacks access to benefits and opportunities, and to blame all the manifestations of exclusion-bred despair on the asserted inferiority of the victims. Two other inter-connected political phenomena emanate from the widely shared belief that whites are superior to blacks. First, whites of widely varying socio-economic status employ white supremacy as a catalyst to negotiate policy differences, often through compromises that sacrifice the rights of blacks. Second, even those whites who lack wealth and power are sustained in their sense of racial superiority and more<br>

There, without doubt, lies the main reason why, of all the objects specific to medical thought, healing is the one that doctors have considered the least.

It makes it ooze that specifically homely goodness: intimations of sound nutrition, careful choice of ingredients, and careful labor (of love).

Perhaps there would be a second Renaissance, a literature of imaginative reason as Arnold called it, growing out of a more intensely self-conscious and critical age, one which could not rely on the unified world-view theology had once provided.<br>

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

  Book Title: Storied Revelations-Parables, Imagination and George MacDonald’s Christian Fiction<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Peterson Eugene H.<br>
  Abstract: George MacDonald, the Victorian poet and theologian, observed that his was a culture saturated with Christian jargon but often void of a profound understanding of the gospel for its own time and culture. The language of Scripture no longer penetrated people’s hearts, thoughts, and attitudes; it no longer transformed people’s lives. MacDonald, called to be a pastor, turned to story and more specifically the "parabolic" as a means of spiritual awakening. He created fictive worlds in which the language of Jesus would find a new home and regain its revelatory power for his particular Victorian audience. 'Storied Revelations' explores the interface between the Bible and George MacDonald’s fiction. The way Jesus uses language in the parables sheds light on our understanding of MacDonald’s careful use of language in his fiction. Further still, many of MacDonald’s stories are infused with the language of the Bible, often in rather surprising ways.<br>

  Abstract: Tradition Having argued for the body within tradition, I now argue for tradition as body. The metaphorical phrase, “the body of a tradition,” is well-known. Indeed, as such a conventional and familiar a metaphor, its metaphorical power has long been lost in ordinary usage. I suspect though that the original inventor(s) of the phrase intuited some vital truth about the nature of tradition. In any case, I desire to make this metaphor fresh again by arguing that the prereflective givenness of tradition strongly parallels the prereflective givenness of the human body.

  Abstract: Historical research has often focused on how the doctrines of Luther’s theology were used by rulers and kings to legitimize power. However, Luther’s theology provided tools for men of political power and critics alike. The latter aspect needs to be explored in a more sophisticated fashion. In this chapter I will try to do just that. I will present a case from Swedish church history where Luther’s doctrine of the priesthood of all believers seems to have worked as an unexplored precursor of public opinion, and as a new way to legitimize power from below.<br>

  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

  Abstract: The Grecanici of Southern Italyprovides a comprehensive ethnography that examines the ways the minority developed and sustain enduring cultural forms of solidarity and relatedness. Stavroula Pipyrou proposes the concept of "fearless governance" to describe overlapping and sometimes contradictory systems of power, authority, and relational networks that enable the Grecanici to achieve political representation at the intersection of local, national, and global encounters. Refuting easy assumptions of top-down governmental influence, Pipyrou shows how the Grecanici find political representation through the European Union and UNESCO, state policy, civic associations, family networks and illegal organizations; not being afraid to take risks, incur wrath, lose friends, or risk death in challenging the political status-quo.<br>

The social system is large in scale and impersonal, hardened into institutions inherited from the past, manageable only by those who have a clear view of their interest. The system is a fusion of aristocratic privilege and middle-class commercialism, supported by a legal structure that can be used to preserve or extend power. Its scale is so great that no one need feel personal responsibility; the system perpetuates itself, and it buries in oblivion both victims and rebels.

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Author(s): Dubisch Jill<br>
  Abstract: Dubisch examines in detail the process of pilgrimage itself, its relationship to Orthodox belief and practice, the motivations and behavior of pilgrims, the relationship between religion and Greek national identity, and the gendered nature of religious roles. Seeking to evoke rather than simply describe, her book presents readers with a sense of the emotion, color, and power of pilgrimage at this Greek island shrine.<br>

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

  Abstract: In the Anastenaria religious healing is brought about by the transformation of a person’s relationship with Saint Constantine from a negative one involving illness and suffering to a positive one involving health and joy, a transformation that takes place when a person becomes an Anastenaris and acquires the supernatural power of the Saint. A person’s relationship with Saint Constantine can, therefore, be seen as a powerful metaphor for the person’s social, psychological, and physiological condition. The Anastenaria provides people who are in a weak, vulnerable, or subordinate position with a spirit idiom that they can use to gain power over<br>

This might seem paradoxical, for how could politics be disregarded when it comes to revolution?

In other words, theorization is understood as a form of neutralization of the historical context.

Postcolonial investigations of disproportionate power relationships at the geopolitical as well as subsidiary levels, and at social and personal levels of the powerful ruler and the subaltern, remain un(der) utilized.

Casting a belief shared by many contemporaries in the language of Constructivism, Moholy announces that photography and film are poised to displace literature as a medium of communication in virtue of their superior clarity, simplicity, and exactness.

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Author(s) Sanok Catherine<br>
  Abstract: In medieval England, as elsewhere, episodes from the lives of the saints constituted one of the most common sources of story, both for layfolk and professional religious. Saints were popular heroes in every genre, held up for admiration, imitation, a good laugh, or the relief of a despairing heart. In their piety and love of God, saints provided models for all of Christendom. Their deeds could be recast for specialised purposes: to demonstrate, for example, how to wield earthly power, conduct oneself appropriately towards superiors or inferiors, resist oppression, or recognise the sins arising from inborn qualities.

  Abstract: Understanding the forces of temporality provides one of the great themes of human enquiry.¹ Much lore is enshrined, not only in learned study, but communally, in myths, literature and proverbs.² Clues are thus provided to the paradoxical properties of time as daily encountered. It not only ‘moves’ and takes specific forms – but it also, simply but inexorably, is . Human perceptions and responses are explored here, panoramically, to enjoy as well as to acknowledge time-power.<br>

  Abstract: During the Enlightenment the concept of power that had dominated ancient and medieval physics underwent a profound transformation. Previously thought to derive from a source beyond the physical world, it came to be viewed as immanent in that world and eventually as coinciding with the very nature of bodiliness. Aristotle’s theory that all motion originated from an unmoved mover had continued to influence Scholastic theories throughout the Middle Ages. For Jewish, Muslim, and Christian thinkers, the impact of divine power went beyond motion and extended to the very existence of finite beings.

In the past several years, novels by Cynthia Ozick, Umberto Eco, and the late John Gardner have unabashedly pondered what Lionel Trilling called ‘‘the great issues with which the mind has traditionally been concerned: whence and whither, birth and death, fate, free will, and immortality.’’ Trilling felt that in neglecting these issues, midtwentieth-century fiction had suffered a loss of emotional power.

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Abstract: Thomas Merton’s vocation was to live what he discovered about himself, in that way he was always open to becoming and there was always potential for change. For the adult Merton the child mind is linked to the experiential, to a theology of feeling and a condition of simplicity. This means to be without artifice, unpretentious, aware of the unconscious and so awake to the illusory nature of the world—and so able to speak truth to power. The foundation for this is a dependence on God framed within the concept of mercy exemplified in God’s relationship with his creation<br>

  Book Title: Bearing Witness-Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).<br>

Nonetheless, the May events had a profound effect on Foucault’s intellectual and political trajectory.

  Book Title: The Priority of Injustice-Locating Democracy in Critical Theory<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Doshi Sapana<br>
  Abstract: Debates about radical democracy, Barnett argues, have become trapped around a set of oppositions between deliberative and agonistic theories-contrasting thinkers who promote the possibility of rational agreement and those who seek to unmask the role of power or violence or difference in shaping human affairs. While these debates are often framed in terms of consensus versus contestation, Barnett unpacks the assumptions about space and time that underlie different understandings of the sources of political conflict and shows how these differences reflect deeper philosophical commitments to theories of creative action or revived ontologies of "the political." Rather than developing ideal theories of democracy or models of proper politics, he argues that attention should turn toward the practices of claims-making through which political movements express experiences of injustice and make demands for recognition, redress, and re pair. By rethinking the spatial grammar of discussions of public space, democratic inclusion, and globalization, Barnett develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the crucial roles played by geographical processes in generating and processing contentious politics.<br>

It means “rule by the people.” Or it means “rule by the many,” to distinguish it from monarchy (rule by a single person), aristocracy (rule by the best), or anarchy (the absence of rule). It is common enough to note that the word “democracy” derives from the Greek words “demos” (the people) and “
                  kratos” (power). But, as Philip Pettit observes, “Each of these words is ambiguous in an interesting way.”¹ Are the people a unified community or a more pluralistic and divided populace? Should power be understood as equivalent to rule, as<br>

No other sign system achieves this. The image, although more effective than the word in presenting in a solitary, contained way what it represents, cannot comment on its object or analyze its own method of representation as language can. Similarly, gesture, or enactment, while performing what it represents and, in this sense, closer to its object, cannot reflect upon itself or the nature of its own operation.

  Abstract: This is a book about the power game currently being played out between two symbiotic cultural institutions: the university and the novel. As the number of hyper-knowledgeable literary fans grows, students and researchers in English departments waiver between dismissing and harnessing voices outside the academy. Meanwhile, the role that the university plays in contemporary literary fiction is becoming increasingly complex and metafictional, moving far beyond the ‘campus novel’ of the mid-twentieth century. Martin Paul Eve’s engaging and far-reaching study explores the novel's contribution to the ongoing displacement of cultural authority away from university English. Spanning the works of Jennifer Egan, Ishmael Reed, Tom McCarthy, Sarah Waters, Percival Everett, Roberto Bolaño and many others, Literature Against Criticism forces us to re-think our previous notions about the relationship between those who write literary fiction and those who critique it.<br>

  Abstract: A critical analysis of neighbourhood planning. Setting empirical evidence from the UK against international examples, the Editors engage in broader debates on the purposes of planning and the devolution of power to localities.Governments around the world are seeing the locality as a key arena for effecting changes in governance, restructuring state/civil society relations and achieving sustainable growth. This is the first book to critically analyse this shift towards localism in planning through exploring neighbourhood planning; one of the fastest growing, most popular and most contentious contemporary planning initiatives. Bringing together original empirical research with critical perspectives on governance and planning, the book engages with broader debates on the purposes of planning, the construction of active citizenship, the uneven geographies of localism and the extent to which power is actually being devolved. Setting this within an international context with cases from the US, Australia and France the book reflects on the possibilities for the emergence of a more progressive form of localism.<br>

  Abstract: In seminal works such as
         Go Tell It on the Mountain,Notes of a Native Son, andThe Fire Next Time, acclaimed author and social critic James Baldwin (1924--1987) expresses his profound belief that writers have the power to transform society, to engage the public, and to inspire and channel conversation to achieve lasting change. While Baldwin is best known for his writings on racial consciousness and injustice, he is also one of the country's most eloquent theorists of democratic life and the national psyche.<br>

  Abstract: With

The “thought of eternal return,” which Nietzsche considers to be the “basic idea of the work,” the “highest possible formula of affirmation,” came to him on a fateful day in August 1881. In Sils-Maria, “6,000 feet beyond people and time,” on his daily walk around Silvaplana Lake, Nietzsche “stopped near Surlei by a huge, pyramidal boulder”—the rock of the eternal return—where the thought came to him (EH Z 1).

The spate of fiftieth anniversary commemorations of this event served not only to reappraise national histories in light of the end of the balance of power sustained during the Cold War, but also to symbolically compensate the dwindling number of living witnesses and victims of the war period.

  Book Title: The Imaginary Revolution-Parisian Students and Workers in 1968<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Seidman Michael<br>
  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

  Abstract: The Protestant Reformation restructured the medieval church in ways that had the potential radically to transform Christian understandings of sexuality and gender roles. Since the days of the early church Fathers, theologians had argued that chastity was spiritually superior to marriage. Church vocations such as the priesthood or the various monastic callings were predicated upon celibacy. Moreover, the Fathers—and the medieval theologians who succeeded them—frequently argued that God created woman to enable humanity to procreate. Medieval theology valued celibacy above marriage and contrasted woman’s procreative power with man’s presumed lofty spiritual temperament. It is not hard to understand,<br>

  Abstract: All human societies are concerned with the regulation of sexuality—a truism of anthropology. And all of them, past and present, exert cultural, political, economic and even psychological controls over how people talk about sex: when, where, with whom and why—not why they are motivated, but why they must be stopped from sexual discourse. These barriers to sexual communication are created for a variety of reasons—notably, gender power, the strictures on childhood sexual and gender development, the regulation of the development of pleasure, the social control of adult morality and the inhibition of sexual behaviour that violates norms<br>

An immense and centralized structure, the Empire was built on strong foundations and accepted by the large majority of subjects. The reign of the famous pax Romana brought security and cohesion to the ancient world and in particular assured a cross-fertilizing of Greek and Latin regions.<br>

In order to resist the destructive effects of adversity, rather, we need to endure with consistency and master the emotions and dispositions that give us staying power.

  Book Title: Blood in the Sand-Imperial Fantasies, Right-Wing Ambitions, and the Erosion of American Democracy<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Bronner Stephen Eric<br>
  Abstract: Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, clouds of ash blackened the skies over New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania. In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along ~<br>

  Author(s): Shain Yossi<br>
  Abstract: Only recently have international relations scholars started to seriously examine the influence of collective memory on foreign policy formation and relations between states and peoples. The ways in which the memories of past events are interpreted, misinterpreted, or even manipulated in public discourse create the context that shapes international relations.
      Power and the Pastbrings together leading history and international relations scholars to provide a groundbreaking examination of the impact of collective memory. This timely study makes a contribution to developing a theory of memory and international relations and also examines specific cases of collective memory's influence resulting from the legacies of World War II, the Holocaust, and September 11. Addressing concerns shared by world leaders and international institutions as well as scholars of international studies, this volume illustrates clearly how the memory of past events alters the ways countries interact in the present, how memory shapes public debate and policymaking, and how memory may aid or more frequently impede conflict resolution.<br>

  Book Title: Ethics in Light of Childhood-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall John<br>
  Abstract: Childhood faces humanity with its own deepest and most perplexing questions. An ethics that truly includes the world's childhoods would transcend pre-modern traditional communities and modern rational autonomy with a postmodern aim of growing responsibility. It would understand human relations in a poetic rather than universalistic sense as openly and interdependently creative. As a consequence, it would produce new understandings of moral being, time, and otherness, as well as of religion, rights, narrative, families, obligation, and power.
      Ethics in Light of Childhoodfundamentally reimagines ethical thought and practice in light of the experiences of the third of humanity who are children. Much like humanism, feminism, womanism, and environmentalism, Wall argues, a new childism is required that transforms moral thinking, relations, and societies in fundamental ways. Wall explores childhood's varied impacts on ethical thinking throughout history, advances the emerging interdisciplinary field of childhood studies, and reexamines basic assumptions in contemporary moral theory and practice. In the process, he does not just apply ethics to childhood but applies childhood to ethics-in order to imagine a more expansive humanity.<br>

  Abstract: Although these two upheavals arose in different environments, they followed similar courses. The thought and language of Enlightenment France were the glories of western civilization; those of tsarist Russia's intelligentsia were on its margins. Both revolutions began as revolts vowed to fight unreason, injustice, and inequality; both swept away old regimes and defied established religions in societies that were 85% peasant and illiterate; both entailed the terrifying return of repressed vengeance. Contrary to prevalent belief, Mayer argues, ideologies and personalities did not control events. Rather, the tide of violence overwhelmed the political actors who assumed power and were rudderless. Even the best plans could not stem the chaos that at once benefited and swallowed them. Mayer argues that we have ignored an essential part of all revolutions: the resistances to revolution, both domestic and foreign, which help fuel the spiral of terror.<br>

Such “theory” takes two forms—“textual realism,” where meaning is found in the text, and “readerly idealism,” where meaning is made through intersubjective agreements among a community of interpreters.

  Abstract: The immediate post–World War II years are taken to be those that mark the emergence not only of the United States as a major world power but also of new American artistic avant-garde, aggressively different in style and aesthetic from previous European modernism. Recently some attention has focused on how Abstract Expressionism came to critical prominence and on the political and cultural implications of this new avant-garde, due to the apparent congruence between an aesthetic that stressed individuality and vigour and the Cold War liberal ideology of the postwar Truman era, which equated these two characteristics with Western (American)<br>

  Abstract: Modernity is an

To explain this as the outcome of historical precedents is to ignore its most significant quality—namely, its success in rendering all rival views of the real obsolete. Its innovative power made modernity, which began as a local Western phenomenon, a universal project capable of forcing its theoretical and practical principles on all but the most isolated civilizations. “Modern” has become the predicate of a unified world culture.<br>

  Abstract: The close connection between rhetoric and religion has profound consequences for the possibility of unity within social and religious communities. Earlier Marjorie O’Rourke Boyle noted that the Renaissance humanists appreciated the “unitive power” of religion and rhetoric, “the bond of society, the integration of self, and communion with God,” drawing on the classical orators for whom speech was a socializing and civilizing act. In a similar way, Kathy Eden’s thoughtful study links adages, commonly held formulations of belief that unify both discursive practice and social relationships, to secular and Christian conceptions and practices of friendship, love, and community.

It seems that trade was the main incentive of Israelites to immigrate to that country. Their position was so strong that around 370 C.E., the major political power in Yemen, the Kingdom of Himyar, adopted Judaism, until the Ethiopian Christians took control of the country and destroyed the Jewish state.

  Abstract: Thinkers like Foucault, who emphasize the priority of cultural discourses in shaping our lives, tend to speak of incarnations of self or power as generic to an age. Yet while such approaches are useful in mapping forms of mind and personhood specific to historical periods and sometimes show how these forms take shape in everyday life, they seldom consider how the stuff of personhood is built out of the events and doings of everyday life. They also tend to neglect the plurality of forces that occasion diverse ways of being at any moment within a society. To rectify this tendency<br>

The potential of the new art did not lie in “imitating the movements of nature” or in “the mistaken path” of its resemblance to theater. Its unique power was a “matter of
                     making images seen.”¹ It is precisely this harnessing of visibility, this act of showing and exhibition, which I feel cinema before 1906 displays most intensely. [Its] inspiration for the avant-garde of the early decades of this century needs to be re-explored.<br>

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Book Title: Poetry as Survival-  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

  Abstract: In the ceaseless interplay of disorder and order in our daily lives, it is possible (and important) to imagine that there are certain situations where this unstable interaction can be held for a moment in steady state. One such suspended moment is the poem, which freeze-frames the interplay as language so that we can contemplate it, feel it, and concentrate on it. Robert Frost once characterized poetry as “a momentary stay against confusion,” and his phrase articulates with eloquent simplicity a poem’s power to lift moments of clarified drama out of the ceaseless, discombobulating flow of experience and, by doing<br>

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

  Author(s) Lahens Yanick<br>
  Abstract: In a recent article in
                  Black Music Research Journal, French sociologist Denis-Constant Martin proposed that Martinican writer Édouard Glissant’s concept of creolization could help reconcile jazz’s historical roots as an African American music with its recent universalization (Martin, 2008). Martin thus joined a growing group of scholars who use the concept of creolization in globalization studies in order to emphasize the fluid and unstable nature of culture. Meanwhile, scholars in postcolonial studies have embraced creolization’s potential to celebrate the creative ingenuity of ‘subaltern and deterritorialized peoples’ and its power to subvert ‘older notions of cultural dissolution and disorganization’ (Khan, 2007:<br>

  Book Title: The Allure of the Archives-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Natalie Zemon<br>
  Abstract: Arlette Farge's
      Le Goût de l'archiveis widely regarded as a historiographical classic. While combing through two-hundred-year-old judicial records from the Archives of the Bastille, historian Farge was struck by the extraordinarily intimate portrayal they provided of the lives of the poor in pre-Revolutionary France, especially women. She was seduced by the sensuality of old manuscripts and by the revelatory power of voices otherwise lost. InThe Allure of the Archives, she conveys the exhilaration of uncovering hidden secrets and the thrill of venturing into new dimensions of the past.Originally published in 1989, Farge's classic work communicates the tactile, interpretive, and emotional experience of archival research while sharing astonishing details about life under the Old Regime in France. At once a practical guide to research methodology and an elegant literary reflection on the challenges of writing history, this uniquely rich volume demonstrates how surrendering to the archive's allure can forever change how we understand the past.<br>

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: Political theory, which presents itself as addressing universal and abiding matters concerning power, obligation, justice, and government in general and unconditioned terms, the truth about things as at bottom they always and everywhere necessarily are, is in fact, and inevitably, a specific response to immediate circumstances. However cosmopolitan it may be in intent, it is, like religion, literature, historiography, or law, driven and animated by the demands of the moment: a guide to perplexities particular, pressing, local, and at hand.<br>

  Abstract: In uncovering the psychological infrastructure of Plato’s engagement with mimesis I suggest in chapter 2 that his unease over the transformative power of mimetic art—its capacity to shape the minds of its audiences by absorbing them imaginatively in the possibility of “other lives”—culminates in an acute anxiety over one particular kind of art, tragedy. It is above all to tragic poetry, a category that Plato, on grounds that will soon emerge, does not limit to Attic drama but treats as embracing the work of Homer (“first of the tragedians”) too,¹ that “the greatest charge” of

  Abstract: This book grew out of a long attempt to understand an epiphany, one I have experienced and that seems often to occur in American trial courts. In the course of trial there emerges an understanding of the people and events being tried that has a kind of austere clarity and power. This experience surprises and “elevates” the participants, including the jury. The grasp of what has occurred and what should be done seems to have a kind of comprehensiveness, almost self-evidence, of which it is extremely difficult to give an account.

  Book Title: The Sense of Music-Semiotic Essays<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hatten Robert<br>
  Abstract: Based on the assumption that music cannot be described without reference to its meaning, Raymond Monelle proposes that works of the Western classical tradition be analyzed in terms of temporality, subjectivity, and topic theory. Critical of the abstract analysis of musical scores, Monelle argues that the score does not reveal music's
         sense.That sense--what a piece of music says and signifies--can be understood only with reference to history, culture, and the other arts. Thus, music is meaningful in that it signifies cultural temporalities and themes, from the traditional manly heroism of the hunt to military power to postmodern "polyvocality."<br>

  Abstract: In July of 1994, the thirty-year reign of Sir Dawada Jawara came to an end as a new political regime rose to power: the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC). During this transition, installed as president was Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh, elected through a peaceful, although not invited, shift in power. The former president, Jawara, had been elected head of state since the end of colonial rule, but the democratic elections that periodically marked the postcolonial political era did not create a shift in political leadership.

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  Abstract: Wolin's riveting narrative reveals that Maoism's allure among France's best and brightest actually had little to do with a real understanding of Chinese politics. Instead, it paradoxically served as a vehicle for an emancipatory transformation of French society. French student leftists took up the trope of "cultural revolution," applying it to their criticisms of everyday life. Wolin examines how Maoism captured the imaginations of France's leading cultural figures, influencing Sartre's "perfect Maoist moment"; Foucault's conception of power; Sollers's chic, leftist intellectual journal

  Abstract: Through no fault of his own, Michel Foucault missed out on May 1968. When the explosion erupted, he was hundreds of miles away teaching philosophy at the University of Tunis. Nonetheless, the May events had a profound effect on Foucault’s intellectual and political trajectory. Foucault himself acknowledged as much, observing that May was the unanticipated “political opening” that gave him the courage to investigate the mechanisms of power operating in Western societies and to “pursue [his] research in the direction of penal theory, prisons, and disciplines.”¹<br>

The rough concurrence of hooliganism and futurism—that is, the appearance, across class lines, of similar behaviors with similar goals, both of which highlighted cultural conflict—illumines a number of issues critical to understanding popular culture in Russia, the relationship between what we think of as popular and elite culture, and the role culture in general played in<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Goodheart Eugene<br>
  Abstract: Eugene Goodheart examines the skeptic disposition that has informed advanced literary discourse over the past generation, arguing that the targets of deconstructive suspicion are fundamental humanistic values. "[This book] is a fair-minded, generous critique of the deconstructionist theories of Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, and their followers. These writers have argued that language is so inherently slippery it can never express a speaker's intended meaning. The critic's role, in their view, is to explore the contradictions, subtexts, and metaphorical byways of works that may be most radically deceptive when they appear simple. Critics have castigated this language-centered skepticism as a form of nihilism geared to multiply numbingly similar readings of already familiar texts. Mr. Goodheart's objection is more subtle. He suggests that the philosophical orientation of deconstructive critics leads them to overemphasize the tricky propositional sense of words at the expense of the broader impact of literature--its power to wound, thrill, or transform us."--Morris Dickstein, The New York Times Book Review<br>

In another, power is represented in the inner world, where mind and heart imagine what they have sought in the physical world and what it has disclosed to them. Investigation into the inner world has unfolded into histories of religions, of ideas, and (not least) moralities, apart from many other forms.<br>

  Abstract: Blake’s myth is above all else psychological. His cosmology, theology, and even epistemology are all transpositions of the central inquiry into the self. This is no disinterested quest. Like many in his age Blake was haunted, if not obsessed, by dividedness within the self and between self and world. As Hegel said in his first published work, division or discord
                  (Entzweiung)“is the source of the need for philosophy.” And both Hegel and Blake were convinced that harmony must be achieved by restoring the fruitful interaction of opposites, not by abolishing them. “When the power of unification disappears from the<br>

  Book Title: I Am You-The Hermeneutics of Empathy in Western Literature, Theology and Art<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Important trends in contemporary intellectual life celebrate difference, divisiveness, and distinction. Speculative writing increasingly highlights "hermeneutic gaps" between human beings, their histories, and their hopes. In this book Karl Morrison identifies an alternative to this disruption. He explores for the first time the entire legacy of thought revolving around the challenging claim "I am you"--perhaps the most concise possible statement of bonding through empathy. Professor Morrison shows that the hope for thoroughgoing understanding and inclusion in another's world view is central to the West's moral/intellectual tradition. He maintains that the West may yet escape the fatal flaw of casting that hope in paradigms of sexual and aesthetic dominance--examples of empathetic participation inspired by hunger for power, as well as by love.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvm0c">I Am You</a><br>
  Abstract: The “strange hermeneutics” practiced by Augustine was a massive apparatus. Its power to convince derived, in part, from its comprehensiveness—that is, from its ability to encompass, digest and absorb the most disparate elements. All agreed that the cycle of understanding consisted of a vicious circle when understanding did not go beyond rhetorical demonstration. For then it became little more than a ventriloquist’s trick, the same person interrogating the text and responding for it. But, when the cycle produced authentic understanding, it was never self-reflective, because it depended on powers, insights, or visions that did not originate in the interrogator,<br>

  Abstract: In the 1980s, cultural anthropology in the United States was transformed by a growing body of critical literature that focused on the politics of ethnography. Historians of anthropology, anthropologists themselves, and literary critics have turned their attention toward the writing of fieldwork as a locus of power relations and historical contexts.¹ The text itself, the document that certifies the authenticity of fieldwork, has come under scrutiny from critics who view ethnography not as a transparent window onto another culture but rather as a poetic and rhetorical translation, inevitably partial and contested.

  Abstract: Relatively neglected by critics in comparison to others of his works, Kleist’s story with the elaborate tripartite title, which can be approximately translated into English as “Saint Cecilia, or the Power of Music (A Legend),” has begun to attract increasing attention. To some extent, this is due to the fact that the other works have been examined and reexamined with such exhausting intensity that a turn to lesser-known texts is inevitable. But it is also the case that, among Kleist’s puzzling prose, this story stands out for its strangeness. What is it about? What is its “message”? In this case,<br>

French members were referred to as uncle, aunt, and brother. This unusually intimate French-Native intercommunal interdependence owed its urgency to extremely sparse French immigration. Due to this anemic immigration, an incomplete society full of surplus young males matched nicely with Native societies suffering from a lack of males. The men suffered especially<br>

The question as to how and where people as groups construct and express the identity that holds them together is more complex than it appears on the surface. Identity politics has made tremendous contributions for the marginalized groups: raising self-awareness and self-dignity; challenging through politicization the mainstream claim to hegemonic power; providing spaces to claim their voices and experiences as legitimate; and empowering both<br>

Understandably, feminist theologians have sought to destabilize the gender rigidity of language about God. And yet feminist rearticulations often bring with them the same discursive rules that are criticized in the use of masculine language. When women’s experience becomes the basis of language for God, feminists risk ascribing a fixed symbol upon the divine name. However, in practices of prayer and contemplation the sheer otherness of God draws us to the limits of language, and causes a blurring of all fixed<br>

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

  Abstract: Israel is the only country in the world that offers free fertility treatments to nearly any woman who requires medical assistance. It also has the world's highest per capita usage of in-vitro fertilization. Examining state policies and the application of reproductive technologies among Jewish Israelis, this volume explores the role of tradition and politics in the construction of families within local Jewish populations. The contributors-anthropologists, bioethicists, jurists, physicians and biologists-highlight the complexities surrounding these treatments and show how biological relatedness is being construed as a technology of power; how genetics is woven into the production of identities; how reproductive technologies enhance the policing of boundaries. Donor insemination, IVF and surrogacy, as well as abortion, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and human embryonic stem cell research, are explored within local and global contexts to convey an informed perspective on the wider Jewish Israeli environment.<br>

  Abstract: A wide-ranging contemporary set of conceptions tout India’s place in a globalizing world, particularly images and discourses increasingly popular since the early 1990s that proclaim India as an emerging global power.

  Abstract: The present essay is an attempt to broaden the temporal, spatial, and social parameters of the origins of the Cold War by adding a third and fourth dimension in order to supplement the traditional two-dimensional approach that focuses on great-power rivalry and ideological combat in the twentieth century. The aim is to widen the overly narrow Eurocentric or Atlantic focus of previous studies and to expand the context of international politics. In a broader temporal-spatial or third dimension, the origins of the Cold War represent a phase in a prolonged struggle over the Eurasian borderlands that stretches back to the<br>

  Abstract: The Belgian Constitutional Court holds an ambiguous position towards European law. Whereas, generally, it has recognized its power to review the conformity of a legislative act approving a treaty with the Constitution, it also deploys these treaties, and more broadly European law as enshrined in treaties and other instruments, to decide upon the constitutionality of other laws. Especially in reviews that rely upon the constitutional principle of non-discrimination, European law can play an important role, providing content to that principle.<br>

  Book Title: Synthetic Biology and Morality-Artificial Life and the Bounds of Nature<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Murray Thomas H.<br>
  Abstract: Synthetic biology, which aims to design and build organisms that serve human needs, has potential applications that range from producing biofuels to programming human behavior. The emergence of this new form of biotechnology, however, raises a variety of ethical questions -- first and foremost, whether synthetic biology is intrinsically troubling in moral terms. Is it an egregious example of scientists "playing God"?
      Synthetic Biology and Moralitytakes on this threshold ethical question, as well as others that follow, offering a range of philosophical and political perspectives on the power of synthetic biology.The contributors consider the basic question of the ethics of making new organisms, with essays that lay out the conceptual terrain and offer opposing views of the intrinsic moral concerns; discuss the possibility that synthetic organisms are inherently valuable; and address whether, and how, moral objections to synthetic biology could be relevant to policy making and political discourse. Variations of these questions have been raised before, in debates over other biotechnologies, but, as this book shows, they take on novel and illuminating form when considered in the context of synthetic biology.ContributorsJohn Basl, Mark A.

  Abstract: Perhaps the fundamental question before us in science policy today involves the extension of human power and artifice into the realm of life. The general question is not new. Shakespeare’s Prospero pondered it, as did Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and H. G. Wells’s Dr. Moreau. But the gap between fantasy and actual technological capacity is closing, so that now the morality of power must speak to the governance of power; ethics must inform public policy.

  Book Title: A Politics of the Ordinary-  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Dumm Thomas L.<br>
  Abstract: In A Politics of the Ordinary, Thomas Dumm dramatizes how everyday life in the United States intersects with and is influenced by the power of events, on the one hand, and forces of conformity and normalcy on the other. Combining poststructuralist analysis with a sympathetic reading of a strain of American thought that begins with Emerson and culminates in the work of Stanley Cavell, A Politics of the Ordinary investigates incidents from everyday life, political spectacles, and popular culture. Whether juxtaposing reflections about boredom in rural New Mexico with Emerson's theory of constitutional amendment, Richard Nixon's letter of resignation with Thoreau's writings to overcome quiet desperation, or demonstrating how Disney's Toy Story allegorizes the downsizing of the American white-collar work force, Dumm's constant concern is to show how the ordinary is the primary source of the democratic political imagination.<br>

One indication of America’s loss of purchase on a democratic future is the discourse of denial surrounding the crises produced on a daily basis by hyper-punitive casino capitalism.¹ Rather than address the ever-proliferating crises produced by market fundamentalism as an opportunity to understand how the United States has arrived at such a point, the dominant classes now use such crises as an excuse for normalizing a growing punishing and warfare state, while consolidating the power of finance capital and the mega-rich.

  Book Title: Negotiating Justice-Progressive Lawyering, Low-Income Clients, and the Quest for Social Change<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Shdaimah Corey S.<br>
  Abstract: While many young people become lawyers for the big bucks, others are motivated by the pursuit of social justice, seeking to help people for whom legal services are financially, socially, or politically inaccessible. These progressive lawyers often bring a considerable degree of idealism to their work, and many leave the field due to insurmountable red tape and spiraling disillusionment. But what about those who stay? And what do their clients think? Negotiating Justice explores how progressive lawyers and their clients negotiate the dissonance between personal idealism and the realities of a system that doesn't often champion the rights of the poor.Corey S. Shdaimah draws on over fifty interviews with urban legal service lawyers and their clients to provide readers with a compelling behind-the-scenes look at how different notions of practice can present significant barriers for both clients and lawyers working with limited resources, often within a legal system that many view as fundamentally unequal or hostile. Through consideration of the central themes of progressive lawyering - autonomy, collaboration, transformation, and social change - Shdaimah presents a subtle and complex tableau of the concessions both lawyers and clients often have to make as they navigate the murky and resistant terrains of the legal system and their wider pursuits of justice and power.<br>

The Conquerors’ towns (

From a phenomenological viewpoint, in the photograph, the power of authentication exceeds the power of representation’ (Barthes 1984: 88–9).

  Abstract: The tradition I sketched in the run-up to my discussion of ‘The Idea of Order at Key West’, that of identifying a spark or charge in poetic language, is sometimes manifested in psychologistic forms in the twentieth century: the energy expressing itself in poetic language is not that of a divine ordering spirit, nor the character of a people, nor a latent ‘chemical’ power in the language itself, but in the psyche of the poet concerned. The surrealist and poet André Breton thought this way. Adopting the language of the poet-critic Pierre Reverdy, who said that one ‘creates … a<br>

  The Future History of Democracy from:

  Abstract: What is radical democracy? Karl Marx’s definition of ‘radical’, from his 1844 ‘Introduction’ to
                  A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, states that to be radical is ‘to grasp the root of the matter’ (Marx [1844] 1970: 137). Thus, ‘radical democracy’ means to grasp or draw out the root meaning or conditions of democracy that have been obscured in its various historical appropriations. Radical democrats argue that there are two central, intertwined and historically constituted root meanings or conditions of democracy: first, the free and equal participation of ‘the people’ (thedemos) in power (kratos); and,<br>

  Abstract: ‘Desire’ is an undoubtedly slippery concept, and one that seems constantly weighed down, as it were, by metaphysical, essentialist and discursive baggage. As we saw in the last chapter, it was for this reason that Foucault felt uncomfortable with Deleuze’s use of desire, albeit subverted. A number of interpreters – Žižek chief among them – have since made this the basis of their critique of Deleuze and the micropolitics of immanence. It is essentially argued that by virtue of retaining desire as a primordial ‘micro’ essence or pre-social multiplicity, Deleuze ends up viewing power as a negative force concomitant with the macro<br>

  Abstract: Hannah Arendt is one of the most revered and reviled philosophers of the twentieth century. Almost sixty years after the publication of

For example, David Cesarani accuses Arendt of being deeply contemptuous of the Jews of Poland and Russia because of her bourgeois German Jewish background. Barry Gewen, reviewing the book in the New York Times, dismisses Cesarani as ‘a writer in control of neither his material nor himself’. Arendt could certainly be dismissive, contemptuous and excessively judgemental of those outside her circle, and yet her flashes<br>

  Abstract: The idea of silent Shakespeare strikes many as oxymoronic. In its muting of Shakespearean drama, silent Shakespearean cinema robs its inherited source of that which most frequently, and perhaps most crucially, has been taken to define it. In effect, the collaboration of this dramatic material with this medium of expression can be read as a liaison of naturally antithetical forces: one imaginatively evokes the image through the suggestive power of the poetically employed word, the other does not just erode the power of the word in its privileging of the image, but all but ousts words from its performance space.<br>

At least two reasons contradict such an idea: firstly, there has always been a great deal of work on metaphor, and, secondly, the concept of metaphor has itself been expanded in cognitive research to encompass questions and fields of study which up until recently had been investigated by scholars who did not consider metaphor to be their principle focus of interest. Indeed, a wide variety of disciplines from grammar to comparative linguistics have now entered into the metaphor debate. In contrast to this loose<br>

  Abstract: This book explores key areas of modern society in which language is used to form power and social relations. These are presented in five sections:Language and the MediaLanguage and OrganisationsLanguage and GenderLanguage and YouthMultilingualism, Identity and EthnicityWith a unique combination of selected readings and student-centred tasks in a single volume, the book covers contemporary issues in language and power, ranging from the global to the interpersonal. Each area - and each reading chosen to explore it - is substantially contextualised and discussed through a detailed introduction and then followed up with related activities.Each section comprises:*a substantial, specific introduction which draws students’ attention to key themes and issues relevant to its topic; *a set of four or five selected readings which encourages students to locate critically these issues in context; *a task, or set of tasks, obliging students to undertake ‘hands-on’ linguistic analysis of data and engage in more sophisticated discussion of pertinent issues.*In-depth exploration of a variety of approaches to the study of language and power*Unique combination of advanced readings, student-centred tasks and editorial guidance*Hands-on activities at the end of each chapter<br>

  Book Title: The Lacanian Left-Psychoanalysis, Theory, Politics<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stavrakakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: In recent years psychoanalysis – especially Lacanian theory – has been gradually acknowledged as a vital resource in the ongoing re-orientation of contemporary political theory and analysis. Of particular note is that the work of Jacques Lacan is increasingly being used by major political philosophers associated with the Left. This indicates the dynamic emergence of a new theoretico-political horizon: that of the ‘Lacanian Left’. However, this has yet to be properly conceived and structured as a field. The Lacanian Left is the first book to bring it into academic consciousness and to draw its implications for concrete political analysis in a systematic way. It offers:• An accessible mapping of its main contours. • A detailed examination of the points of convergence and divergence between the major figures active or at the periphery of this terrain, including Slavoj h the central Lacanian notion of ‘enjoyment’, The Lacanian Left puts forward innovative analyses of political power and authority, nationalism, European identity, consumerism and advertising culture, de-democratisation and post-democracy. It will be of value to everyone interested in exploring the potential of psychoanalysis to reinvigorate political theory, critical political analysis and democratic politics.<br>

  Abstract: If magic is error for modernity, then the most scandalous of its errors is its collapsing into identity of words and objects. As Randall Styers argues, one of the central themes running through scholarly work on magic from the second half of the nineteenth century is the claim that magic is fixated on the power of words (Styers 2004: 219ff.). Certainly magic is often defined as that which attempts to animate matter, but again and again writers on magic assert a particular attitude to language as central to this animation.

It also implies that the terminology of generality, particularity, and generative power has a degree of referential undecidability which should exclude any simplified metaphorical use of these terms, while anticipating the failure to achieve such vigilance, or such immunity to rhetorical seduction.

  Book Title: The Minor Intimacies of Race-Asian Publics in North America<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniels Roger<br>
  Abstract: An attempt to put an Asian woman on Canada's $100 bill in 2012 unleashed enormous controversy. The racism and xenophobia that answered this symbolic move toward inclusiveness revealed the nation's trumpeted commitment to multiculturalism as a lie. It also showed how multiple minor publics as well as the dominant public responded to the ongoing issue of race in Canada. In this new study, Christine Kim delves into the ways cultural conversations minimize race's relevance even as violent expressions and structural forms of racism continue to occur. Kim turns to literary texts, artistic works, and media debates to highlight the struggles of minor publics with social intimacy. Her insightful engagement with everyday conversations as well as artistic expressions that invoke the figure of the Asian allows Kim to reveal the affective dimensions of racialized publics. It also extends ongoing critical conversations within Asian Canadian and Asian American studies about Orientalism, diasporic memory, racialized citizenship, and migration and human rights. An original reconsideration of foundational concerns, The Minor Intimacies of Race focuses on the ephemeral and the nuanced to reveal the social hierarchies and power structures inherent in today's North America.<br>

But first it is necessary to take another look at heroism as a key plot in the men’s stories. The gendered nature of the heroic tale and the gender gap in violence signal the importance of cultural constructions of power, agency, and autonomy, to violence, which in turn suggests that narratives<br>

  Abstract: Jill H. Casid demonstrates across a range of sites that the scene of projection is neither a static diagram of power nor a fixed architecture but rather a pedagogical setup that operates as an influencing machine of persistent training. Thinking with queer and feminist art projects that take up old devices for casting an image to reorient this apparatus of power that produces its subject,
      Scenes of Projectionoffers a set of theses on the possibilities for felt embodiment out of the damaged and difficult pasts that haunt our present.<br>

  Abstract: The second in a four-part series charting the social, cultural, and political expression of clothing, dress, and accessories,
         Exchanging Clothesfocuses on the concept of transnational "circulation and exchange"-not only the global exchange of material commodities across time and space but also of the ideas, images, colors, and textures related to fashion. Essays examine the parade of heroes past, from Homer and Virgil to Dante and Ariosto, wearing armor or nothing; the social power of a tie or of a safety pin sprung from punk fashion to the red carpet; a Midwestern thrift store, from cheap labor to cheap purchase, as a microcosm of global circulation; and lesbian pulp fiction as how-to-dress manuals.<br>

  Abstract: To explain the phenomenon of encounter, Carter performs it in differing scales, spaces, languages, tropes, and forms of knowledge, staging in the very language of the book what he calls "passages." In widely varying contexts, these passages posit the disjunction of Greco-Roman and Indigenous languages, codes, theatrics of power, social systems, and visions of community. In an era of new forms of technosocialization, Carter offers novel ways of presenting the philosophical dimensions of waiting, meeting, and non-meeting.<br>

However, the object was not to defend their instrumentalization, their colonization in the interests of power.

  Book Title: Agitating Images-Photography against History in Indigenous Siberia<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Craig<br>
  Abstract: Agitating Imagesprovides a glimpse into the first moments of cultural engineering in remote areas of Soviet Siberia. The territories were perceived by outsiders to be on the margins of civilization, replete with shamanic rituals and inhabited by exiles, criminals, and "primitive" indigenous peoples. The Soviets hoped to permanently transform the mythologized landscape by establishing socialist utopian developments designed to incorporate minority cultures into the communist state. This book delves deep into photographic archives from these Soviet programs, but rather than using the photographs to complement an official history, Campbell presents them as anti-illustrations, or intrusions, that confound simple narratives of Soviet bureaucracy and power. Meant to agitate, these images offer critiques that cannot be explained in text alone and, in turn, put into question the nature of photographs as historical artifacts.<br>

  Book Title: Narratives of Agency-Self-Making in China, India, and Japan<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Dissanayake Wimal<br>
  Abstract: This multidisciplinary collection underlines the importance of understanding the operations of human agency-defined here as the ability to exert power, specifically in resistance to ideological pressure. In particular, the contributors emphasize the historical and cultural conditions that facilitate the production of agency in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures of China, India, and Japan. In Narratives of Agency, scholars from a variety of disciplines argue that traditional Western approaches to the study of these cultures have unduly focused on the pervasive influence of family and clan (China), caste and fatalism (India), and groupism (Japan). This tendency has been exacerbated by modern critical approaches, such as postmodernism and poststructuralism, that not only are increasingly popular in studying these cultures but also de-emphasize the role of the individual. The resultant undermining of the notion of human agency tends to give short shrift to the very real individual differences between groups and ignores questions of personal desire and intentionality. These essays remind us that members of a community have to make personal choices, struggle and interact with others, argue about positions, and confront new challenges, all of which involve intentionality and human agency. A new look at a topic central to cross-cultural understanding, Narratives of Agency will be essential reading for those interested in China, India, Japan, and the world beyond._x000B_ _x000B_Contributors: Richard G.

  Book Title: Reclaiming the Enlightenment-Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRONNER STEPHEN ERIC<br>
  Abstract: With its championing of democracy, equality, cosmopolitanism, and reason -- and its vociferous attacks on popular prejudice, religious superstition, and arbitrary abuses of power -- the Enlightenment was once hailed as the foundation of all modern, progressive politics. But in 1947, this perspective was dramatically undermined when Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno published their classic work,
      Dialectic of Enlightenment, which claims that the Enlightenment was the source of totalitarianism and the worst excesses of modernity. Reclaiming the Enlightenment from purely philosophical and cultural interpretations, Bronner shows that its notion of political engagement keeps democracy fresh and alive by providing a practical foundation for fostering institutional accountability, opposing infringements on individual rights, instilling an enduring commitment to social reform, and building a cosmopolitan sensibility. This forceful and timely reinterpretation of the Enlightenment and its powerful influence on contemporary political life is a resounding wake-up call to critics on both the left and the right.<br>

A distinction is often made between theories that focus on “power over” persons or groups and those that speak of “power to” do or achieve something. Habermas’s theory of society seeks both to clarify the connections between the most important—and traditionally competing—conceptions of power and to clarify their normative hierarchy. To this end, he distinguishes between communicative, administrative, and social power. With regard to the legitimacy of political processes, the task involves, above all, determining<br>

  Abstract: Marx called France the political nation par excellence, as compared to economic England and philosophical Germany. But Marx arrived at his mature theory only after a stern critique of a “merely political” view of revolution. And some of his most important insights are developed in analyses of the failures of revolution in France. While Marx’s observation is insightful, the theoretical conclusions he drew from it are problematic. The monarchy in France was not absolute because it was all-powerful or arbitrary; its power came from the means by which it dominated all spheres of life, transforming an administrative and territorial entity<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 3 I endorsed in principle Kant’s vision of a peaceful worldwide federation of republics and even more so contemporary cosmopolitan democrats’ vision of a planetary system of overlapping authorities structured so as to best combine the need for democratic accountability with sufficient scope to meet the challenges of globalization while ensuring a modicum of justice at a global level. The problem with these ideas, I suggested, lies much less in the details of any particular design than in the extreme difficulty of achieving them; for the exercise of power required to bring them into being would almost surely<br>

  Book Title: Governance in the New Global Disorder-Politics for a Post-Sovereign Society<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): SASSEN SASKIA<br>
  Abstract: When we talk about globalization, we tend to focus on its social and economic benefits. In
         Governance in the New Global Disorder, the political philosopher Daniel Innerarity considers its unsettling and largely unacknowledged consequences. The "opening" of different societies to new ideas, products, and forms of prosperity has introduced a persistent uncertainty, or disorder, into everyday life. Multinational corporations have weakened sovereignty. We no longer know who is in control or who is responsible. Economies can collapse without sufficient warning, and the effort to rebuild can drag on for years. Piracy is everywhere. Is there any way to balance the interests of state, marketplace, and society in this new construct of power?<br>

  Abstract: The renown of Danish existentialist Søren Kierkegaard is one of the most compelling proofs there is of how the canon of philosophy is constantly reinvented as time passes—a process that collective forces and historical contingencies rule and that personal brilliance and textual power can do startlingly little to affect by themselves. At the dawn of the twentieth century, none of the standard histories of philosophy—except one by Harald Høffding, who was (predictably enough) then the main Danish thinker of European note—stopped at Kierkegaard’s tomb in their tours of the graveyard of thought, and then only briefly.¹ At<br>

  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas’s philosophy seems, across its different periods, to display the most salient trait of contemporary philosophy. This contemporary philosophy is characterized by what we can call its “antispeculative” habitus, a habitus that is entirely structured around a critique of classical metaphysics, generally characterized as a symbol of the hubris of a human thought that desires to subjugate the entirety of what there is under its almighty power. All the trends that I have already discussed could be united under this banner, as could just as easily Derridian deconstruction.

  Abstract: Drawing on a vast and diverse archive in theory, testimony, and image and on such thinkers as Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno, and others, the intellectual historian Enzo Traverso explores the varying nature of left melancholy as it has manifested in a feeling of guilt for not sufficiently challenging authority, in a fear of surrendering in disarray and resignation, in mourning the human costs of the past, and in a sense of failure for not realizing utopian aspirations. Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

  Author(s): VÁZQUEZ-ARROYO ANTONIO Y.<br>
  Abstract: Sounding the alarm for those who care about robust forms of civic engagement, this book fights for a new conception of political responsibility that meets the challenges of today's democratic practice. Antonio Y. Vázquez-Arroyo forcefully argues against the notion that modern predicaments of power can only be addressed ethically or philosophically through pristine concepts that operate outside of the political realm. By returning to the political, the individual is reintroduced to the binding principles of participatory democracy and the burdens of acting and thinking as a member of a collective. Vázquez-Arroyo historicizes the ethical turn to better understand its ascendence and reworks Adorno's dialectic of responsibility to reassert the political in contemporary thought and theory.<br>

  Book Title: Cosmopolitanism in Mexican Visual Culture-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández María<br>
  Abstract: Since the colonial era, Mexican art has emerged from an ongoing process of negotiation between the local and the global, which frequently involves invention, synthesis, and transformation of diverse discursive and artistic traditions. In this pathfinding book, María Fernández uses the concept of cosmopolitanism to explore this important aspect of Mexican art, in which visual culture and power relations unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. She argues that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization constructed power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent nation-state. Accordingly, Fernández presents not only the visual qualities of objects, but also the discourses, ideas, desires, and practices that are fundamental to the very existence of visual objects.<br>

Cosmopolitanism is understood here as an evolving complex of power relations with material, social, ideational, and affective manifestations, which unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. To associate cosmopolitanism with power is to suggest its compatibility with violence.

Yet khipu predated the Inka Empire by at least a thousand years.

In

  Book Title: Nation as Grand Narrative-The Nigerian Press and the Politics of Meaning<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Adebanwi Wale<br>
  Abstract: Nation as Grand Narrative offers a methodical analysis of how relations of domination and subordination are conveyed through media narratives of nationhood. Using the typical postcolonial state of Nigeria as a template and engaging with disciplines ranging from media studies, political science, and social theory to historical sociology and hermeneutics, Wale Adebanwi examines how the nation as grand narrative provides a critical interpretive lens through which competition among ethnic, ethnoregional, and ethnoreligious groups can be analyzed. Adebanwi illustrates how meaning is connected to power through ideology in the struggles enacted on the pages of the print media over diverse issues including federalism, democracy and democratization, religion, majority-minority ethnic relations, space and territoriality, self-determination, and threat of secession. Nation as Grand Narrative will trigger further critical reflections on the articulation of relations of domination in the context of postcolonial grand narratives.

  Abstract: In this chapter, I concentrate on how the symbolic manifestation of territoriality is used to structure other manifestations. I describe this symbolic manifestation as
                     discursive territoriality, one in which the media become resources “through which power is exercised to produce—or disrupt—systemic regularity.”¹ Discursive territoriality is a dimension of spatial politics, one in which the material and emotional dimensions of space are harnessed in the narratives and discourses of power, which then align particular people firmly, and sometimes also exclusively, to particular territories and privilege their claims to the material benefits of—and emotional attachment to—such spaces.<br>

  Abstract: The fundamental changes in world politics in the early 1990s — the breakup of the Soviet bloc and the subsequent reconfiguration of eastern Europe as new constellations of power emerged — dominated television programming internationally for many months. Live news coverage shaped the way people perceived these events. Television as a medium was an important part of these processes and has determined how they are remembered today. West German television played a particularly crucial role during the weeks of political turmoil in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the fall of 1989.

Kafka’s intent, it has been said, is “to make strange the familiar.”² Like his much admired model, Gustave Flaubert, he radically changed the fictional worlds that European realism had mapped out.³ The transformative power of his writing, however, unlike Flaubert’s, arises from the stark, suggestive force of his images: the resulting dynamics of puzzlement and shock reveal<br>

  Book Title: Interconnections-Gender and Race in American History<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Parker Alison M.<br>
  Abstract: This collection builds on decades of interdisciplinary scholarship by African American women and gender historians and feminist scholars, bridging the gap between well-developed theories of race, gender, and power and the practice of historical research. It reveals the interdependent construction of racial and gender identity in individuals' lived experiences in specific historical contexts, such as westward expansion, civil rights movements, or economic depression as well as national and transnational debates over marriage, citizenship and sexual mores. All of these essays consider multiple aspects of identity, including sexuality, class, religion, and nationality, among others, but the volume emphasizes gender and race--the focus of our new book series--as principal bases of identity and locations of power and oppression in American history.

  Author(s) Braun Carol Moseley<br>
  Abstract: Scholars of intersectionality, historically and presently, start from the premise that both lived identities and structures of power and privilege should be understood as interwoven and not as additive factors or as separable dynamics. Intersectional approaches therefore entail a significant shift in epistemological, ontological, and methodological frames: fundamentally emphasizing simultaneity, scholars of intersectionality employ “tactics, strategies, and identities which historically have appeared to be mutually exclusive under modernist oppositional practices.” Because this alternative mode of reasoning can readily lead to charges of illogic, as Kimberlé Crenshaw has discussed at length, those who employ intersectionality frequently confront being misread or misunderstood.¹<br>

  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Book Title: The Civil Wars after 1660-Public Remembering in Late Stuart England<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Neufeld Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book examines the conflicting ways in which the civil wars and Interregnum were remembered, constructed and represented in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England. It argues that during the late Stuart period, public remembering of the English civil wars and Interregnum was not concerned with re-fighting the old struggle but rather with commending and justifying, or contesting and attacking, the Restoration settlements. After the return of King Charles II the political nation had to address the question of remembering and forgetting the recent conflict. The answer was to construct a polity grounded on remembering and scapegoating puritan politics and piety. The proscription of the puritan impulse enacted by the Restoration settlements was supported by a public memory of the 1640s and 1650s which was used to show that Dissenters could not, and should not, be trusted with power. Drawing upon the interdisciplinary field of social memory studies, this book offers a new perspective on the historical and political cultures of early modern England, and will be of significant interest to social, cultural and political historians as well as scholars working in memory studies.

  Book Title: Spanish Golden Age Poetry in Motion-The Dynamics of Creation and Conversation<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: The fourteen essays of this volume engage in distinct ways with the matter of motion in early modern Spanish poetics, without limiting the dialectic of stasis and movement to any single sphere or manifestation. Interrogation of the interdependence of tradition and innovation, poetry, power and politics, shifting signifiers, the intersection of topography and deviant temporalities, the movement between the secular and the sacred, tensions between centres and peripheries, issues of manuscript circulation and reception, poetic calls and echoes across continents and centuries, and between creative writing and reading subjects, all demonstrate that Helgerson's central notion of conspicuous movement is relevant beyond early sixteenth-century secular poetics, By opening it up we approximate a better understanding of poetry's flexible spatio-temporal co-ordinates in a period of extraordinary historical circumstances and conterminous radical cultural transformation. Los catorce ensayos de este volumen conectan de una manera perceptible con el tema del movimiento en la poesía española del siglo de oro, sin limitar la dialéctica de la estasis y movimiento a una sola esfera o manifestación única. Entre los multiples enfoques cabe destacar: el cuestionamiento de la interdependencia de la tradición e inovación, de la poesía, del poder y la política, de los significantes que se transforman, de los espacios que conectan y cruzan con los tiempos 'desviados'; análisis de las tensiones entre lo sagrado y lo secular, del conflicto centro-periferia y del complejo sistema de producción, circulación y recepción de los manuscritos; el diálogo con el eco poético a través de los siglos y de los continentes y la construcción creativa del sujeto escritor y/o lector. Al abrir la noción central de Helgerson del "movimiento conspicuo" más allá de la poesía nueva secular, este libro propone un entendimiento más completo de las coordinadas espacio-temporales de la poesía en un periodo de circunstan~<br>

This is particularly the case where cultural canons are concerned. Canons embody contemporary values and effectively function, as Paul Lauter observes, as “a means by which culture validates social power.”¹ This phenomenon can be perceived clearly in the constructs of the musical canon that pervaded in the early years of the German Democratic Republic.

  Book Title: Fighting For Time-Shifting Boundaries of Work and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Kalleberg Arne L.<br>
  Abstract: Though there are still just twenty-four hours in a day, society’s idea of who should be doing what and when has shifted. Time, the ultimate scarce resource, has become an increasingly contested battle zone in American life, with work, family, and personal obligations pulling individuals in conflicting directions. In Fighting for Time, editors Cynthia Fuchs Epstein and Arne Kalleberg bring together a team of distinguished sociologists and management analysts to examine the social construction of time and its importance in American culture. Fighting for Time opens with an exploration of changes in time spent at work—both when people are on the job and the number of hours they spend there—and the consequences of those changes for individuals and families. Contributors Jerry Jacobs and Kathleen Gerson find that the relative constancy of the average workweek in America over the last thirty years hides the fact that blue-collar workers are putting in fewer hours while more educated white-collar workers are putting in more. Rudy Fenwick and Mark Tausig look at the effect of nonstandard schedules on workers’ health and family life. They find that working unconventional hours can increase family stress, but that control over one’s work schedule improves family, social, and health outcomes for workers. The book then turns to an examination of how time influences the organization and control of work. The British insurance company studied by David Collinson and Margaret Collinson is an example of a culture where employees are judged on the number of hours they work rather than on their productivity. There, managers are under intense pressure not to take legally guaranteed parental leave, and clocks are banned from the office walls so that employees will work without regard to the time. In the book’s final section, the contributors examine how time can have different meanings for men and women. Cynthia Fuchs Epstein points out that professional women and stay-at-home fathers fac~<br>

  Abstract: After Parsonsis a fresh examination of Parsons' theoretical undertaking, its significance for social scientific thought, and its implications for present-day empirical research. The book is divided into four parts: Social Institutions and Social Processes; Societal Community and Modernization; Sociology and Culture; and the Human Condition. The chapters deal with Parsons' notions of societal community, societal evolution, and modernization and modernity.After Parsonsaddresses major themes of enduring relevance, including social differentiation and cultural diversity, social solidarity, universalism and particularism, and trust and affect in social life. The contributors explore these topics in a wide range of social institutions-family and kinship, economy, polity, the law, medicine, art, and religion-and within the context of contemporary developments such as globalization, the power of the United States as an "empireless empire," the emergence of forms of fundamentalism, the upsurge of racial, tribal, and ethnic conflicts, and the increasing occurence of deterministic and positivistic thought.<br>

Ends, means, and resources are caught up in an interdependent feedback process.”

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

  Abstract: Acknowledgement of the historical relevance of the private–public dichotomy is often associated with Jürgen Habermas’s influential theory, focusing as it does on the bourgeois public sphere in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In his view, this public sphere was characterized by open communication, rational argument, and reason. He also views it as something new, in stark contrast to the representative public sphere of premodern society, in which hierarchical power presented itself to the people in what was to all intents and purposes one-way communication.¹ In recent decades, however, Habermas’s ideas have been challenged, not least by historians studying popular<br>

  Abstract: This essay traces the evolution of the views on the communist takeover in Bulgaria (September 9, 1944), the “people’s democracy” (1944–1948), and socialism for the duration of the regime and after its fall. The communist regime shaped and strictly controlled knowledge about itself, its genesis, and its past. The regime’s ideologically distorted self-image is of interest to historiography as an extreme case in which historical knowledge is subject to direct politicization and ideologization in legitimating power. At first sight, notions about the past would seem to be fixed once and for all. But precisely because knowledge of the past<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara follows others in questioning how sharp the distinction is. Commentators such as Thomas McCarthy have focused on the relation between the moral aspects of discourse, concerned with questions of justice, and ethical aspects, concerned with values and conceptions of good. Lara focuses on the relation between discourse over norms and narrative structure. She first expands Habermas’s account of illocutionary force to include not only well‐argued reasons but also “powerfully imaginative speech” (p. 2), and she then associates imaginative speech with narratives that are revealing in their effects. Coming to an agreement with others over the validity of norms is not a question simply of raising and redeeming validity claims. Moral claims have the capacity to engage us, instead, insofar as they are parts of narratives of power and oppression, indignity and response, indifference and the articulation of authentic identities. Lara shows how this reconceived notion of illocutionary force figures in struggles for recognition in the public sphere: citizens present to one another conceptions of subjectivity, notions of morality, and expectations about the good life and restructure them together.<br>

      Animal LiberationorThe Case for Animal Rightsor—if the course has a broader, multi‐issue focus—it can serve as a stand‐alone introduction to the topic of the moral status of nonhuman animals. It might also be used as an intermediary between, say,Animal Liberation(setting out a “pro” position) and Peter Carruthers’sThe Animals Issue(setting out a “con” position). However it is used, the book will give students an appreciation for the power, subtlety, and fairness of philosophical analysis and criticism. The book is meticulously edited and elegantly written. Despite the depressing (and sometimes distressing) subject matter, it is a pleasure to read.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Author(s): Lichterman Paul<br>
Abstract: Michelle Rosaldo’s (
            1982,1973) studies of public speech in the Philippines, at the advent of Western influence, provide one splendid example of such work. Rosaldo argues that the native Ilongots’ traditional, flowery, indirect public speech style implicitly acknowledged their idea that no one person had a singular claim to the truth and that no one could do very much to enforce one version of the truth in a dispute between differing truth claims. When Western imperial powers overshadowed local rulers’ power, the speech style became more direct and forceful. The West brought the idea that there was one universal, single truth, and that there were powerful institutions that could enforce that single truth, even if not everyone accepted it as truth. These new collective representations—new notions of truth, power, and personhood—were inseparable from the change to a more direct, brusque, conflictive, Western style of public discourse.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Some of what was lacking in the second paradigm in linguistic anthropology (and much of discourse studies) has been recovered or given new interest in the third paradigm described by Duranti. Unfortunately, apart from mentioning some issues (such as narrative, ideology, gender, racism), he does not detail this current paradigm as much as the second. This may be because the third paradigm is just beginning in anthropology or because unfortunatelybecause of space limitationshe has had to limit himself to the United States. The fact is that much of this work is being done in discourse studies (and related studies such as womens studies and ethnic studies), especially in Europe, South America, and other parts of the world, often within a prominent ethnographic or cultural context that makes it directly relevant to anthropology. As is also the case in conversation analysis, much of this work reintegrates some of the macro categories earlier banned from interactional studies in sociology and anthropology, such as the role of institutions, groups, power, and domination. Indeed, gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the close integration of much talk and text with organizations and institutions, require both a local, micro approach and a global or macro approach that links discourse to the processes of societal reproduction and change. Both in linguistic anthropology and in discourse analysis, the consequent double integration of the local and the global and of the cognitive and the social means a real break with previous paradigms.<br>

Issue: ci.2003.29.issue-4<br>

Author(s): Mialet Hélène<br>
Abstract: By unfolding itself and making itself visible through the machine, Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body calls into question that which constitutes the primacy of the body itself, distinguishing it definitively from other objects. The body can’t be “a mere object of which he is conscious as he is of every other ‘thing’ in the world.” If so, he would have “embraced the position of the ‘pure subject’ who is a
         spectatorbefore the world and also before his own body which he considers as part of the world of objects.”55Because “in so far as it sees or touches the world, my body can therefore be neither seen nor touched. What prevents its ever being an object, ever being ‘completely constituted’ is that it is that by which there are objects. It is neither tangible nor visible in so far as it is that which sees and touches.”56Indeed, “I am not in front of my body, I am in it, or rather I am it.”57In other words, the perceiving body is always behind the perceived object, which is why my body “offers itself obstinately ‘from the same side’ without my being able to go around it.”58In a way we can say that Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body is registering in the same text as his speech; they both appear on the screen in front of him. Without this work of objectification of the body, Hawking cannot be his body. The body is felt but also represented as an exterior thing before it can do anything. With him the distinction between body‐object and body‐subject disappears. The human body conceived as a body‐object, that is, which “allows between its parts or between itself and other objects only external or mechanical relations” has become his own body or the body‐subject, that is, “‘his’ body as the center of ‘his’ existence, as the power both to act and to perceive and as a means for the subject to be part of the world.”59We thus see the movement of a certain form of absence‐presence that characterizes the body as Leder described it, but in another form. For Leder, the body is alway~<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Date: 01 2005<br>
Author(s): Seed John<br>
Abstract: These historical texts about the origins of Dissent were merely the most visible forms of the ways in which memories of the Dissenting past were reproduced in the eighteenth century. Much was no doubt transmitted orally in family conversation. Memories were also held in material objects—in buildings, in gravestones and memorial plaques, in the family Bible and other books. Week after week of attendance at a chapel that traced its history back to the same historical moment, and that honored its ancestors and founders, reinforced a congregational identity rooted in narratives of persecution, of resistance to popery and arbitrary power, of unflinching commitment to religious and civil liberty. The weekly sermons of the minister were similarly important in the transmission of memory and of a self‐consciously historical identity. Funeral sermons in particular were opportunities for conjuring up the past, reconnecting to the heroic sufferings of a previous generation. Here the strong family roots of Dissent give history a powerful emotional charge. Genealogy and family lore intersected with the political history of the nation. Fathers and grandfathers and great‐grandfathers had suffered for the cause of truth and might even be there, honored, among the 2,000 victims listed by name in the two editions of the
      Abridgementor in theContinuation. Under the name Edmund Calamy on the title page was addedfils et nepos, son and grandson. And when Laurence Echard, in hisHistory of England, made some derogatory remarks on the Puritan preacher Edmund Calamy, his grandson—some eighty years after—declared that he counted it an honor to be descended from him.60Much of the biographical material in his histories had been sent to him by the family relations of ejected ministers so that these texts were, in some degree, a collective work of memory by the Dissenting community of the early eighteenth century. In numberless forms, the memory of the Restoration betrayal, of “the Great Ejec~<br>

Abstract: Despite this, metaphysics has indeed replied (whether it should be allowed to or not) to the question concerning man’s definition of himself. And we know well that the Cartesian
         cogitohas no other importance than to assure theegoits comprehension of itself and thus to impose itself as the first principle of every other science. Nevertheless, it would be more fitting to doubt this vulgate of Cartesianism, because the texts of Descartes so often contradict it. Contradiction occurs first of all because theego’s very performance of its existence unfolds within a space that is, from the outset, dialogical (with theDeus qui potest omnia, with thegenius aliquis malignius).43Next, contradiction occurs because theegoof thecogitorecognizes that its finite thought culminates in a faculty of will that is paradoxically infinite, “ratione cujus imaginem quandam et similitudinem Dei me refere intelligo” (“in virtue of [which] … I understand myself to bear in some way the image and likeness of God”); and above all the common understanding of the comprehensibility of theegois contradicted because theegoidentifies its faculty of thinking of itself with the image and likeness of God within it, to the point that the faculty of self‐knowing is simply one with the faculty of knowing God: “ex hoc uno quod Deus me creavit, valde credibile est me quodammodo ad imaginem et similitudinem ejus factum esse, illamque similitudinem, in qua Dei idea continetur, a me precipi per eandem facultatem, per quam ego ipse a me percipior” (“but the mere fact that God created me is a very strong basis for believing that I am somehow made in his image and likeness and that I perceive that likeness, which includes the idea of God, by the same faculty which enables me to perceive myself”).44Let us consider this extraordinary text: founding the thinking of self upon my thinking of God, to the point of merging them within the space opened by the image of and likeness to God.

Abstract: Albert Camus, who should have been that Algerian‐colonial writer, if not strictly a
         pied noir,that Braudel curiously invoked in his 1972JMHreverie of an AlgerianGone with the Wind,was born in Oran in 1913 and beganlycéein 1923, the same year Braudel arrived to teachlycéein Constantine.118He attended the University of Algiers between 1932 and 1936, beginning his studies there just as Braudel was leaving Algeria for Paris and then Brazil. Camus published his great novel,The Plague,in 1947, the year of Braudel’sthèse;and Camus himself spent 1949, the year ofLa Méditerranée’s publication, in Brazil. These superficial correspondences have no causal relationship; rather, their juxtaposition evokes the mental world of denial and disjunction between France and Algeria that France maintained as the colonial power, the combatant in two world wars, the humiliated defeated dependent of Nazi Germany, and the postwar recovering power. InThe Plague,“Camus’s insistence on placing individual moral responsibility at the heart of all public choices”119presents a vision of history that appears to be diametrically opposed to that of Braudel’s “possibilism.”<br>

Abstract: Unlike the face‐to‐face scene of oratorical persuasion, the scene of administration or control is best modeled by a thoroughly impersonal mechanism, such as a thermostat, which emits its commands in direct response to information. Admittedly this model is ideal. The thermostat cares only for the good of the building, which is far simpler than a bureaucratic organization, riddled with interpersonal relations that interrupt the mechanisms of control. Still, control is not just another name for power, a point that we can confirm quickly by comparing it to Foucault’s concept of power‐knowledge, and to his favorite scene of power, the doctor‐patient relation. This scene is very different from the site of control in complex organizations, where individuals in vast communicative networks are dependent, whatever their rank, on the transmission of information possessed by others and where all functionaries are equally compelled, whenever they write, to submit their writing to certain generic constraints. Even the doctors have learned of late what it means to be controlled, or managed. That control often trumps their knowledge and so their power.<br>

Abstract: McNay’s
      Gender and Agency, while differing fromGender in the Mirrorin focus, shares in Meyers’s vexation with existing approaches to agency. McNay is particularly suspicious of theorists of cultural studies who “impute to certain everyday practices a kind of inherently subversive status” (4). She argues that the widely deployed idea of everyday resistance has no impact when the interplay between individual behavior and social norms is ignored: “This, in turn, indicates the necessity of contextualizing agencywithin power relationsin order to understand how acts deemed as resistant may transcend their immediate sphere in order to transform collective behavior and norms” (4, emphasis added). One can see that McNay is explicitly conscious of the tension that lurks in Meyers’s work, and the point is repeated throughout the book: “Analysis of the way in which certain subversive practices may get taken up and collectivized is important if resistance is to mean anything other than the truism that individuals do not reproduce social norms in a straightforward fashion” (129). Yet even more than Meyers’s, McNay’s argument glides from the language of mandate in her proposals (analogous to Meyers’s “musts”) to the language of possibility and potential in the results: a new theory of contextualized feminist agency could, may, might lead to collective action and greater freedom for women.<br>

Abstract: With regard to individual lives and libraries in the life of persons, Wiegand points to the failure of information science to “construct models of a personal ‘information economy’ for individuals,” ones that analyze how individuals appropriate information “in efforts to make sense of the world around them in their everyday lives” [
         2, p. 24]. He argues that, relative to other disciplines, researchers in LIS have not benefited from the critical thinking that has been available; he cites, for example, work done on the relationship of power to knowledge. Invoking Douglas Zweizig, he calls for a switch in emphasis to the library in the life of the user and away from the user in the life of the library, which has so captured our imaginations to date. Furthermore, he concludes that the arena of study we call “information science” continues to be defined by the technology that is characteristic of the field as we know it today. He argues that, built on expertise rather than authority, this discourse, with its focus on technology, renders people and their culture invisible; those not using the technologies at the heart of information science are being ignored [3].<br>

Abstract: The argumentative equivalence of race and gender in the analysis of
         Paris Is Burningis mirrored, in turn, in analogical descriptions that the film cannot sustain. Questioning the results of Venus’s denaturalization of gender and sexuality, Butler writes, “As much as she crosses gender, sexuality, and race performatively, the hegemony that reinscribes the privileges of normative femininity and whiteness wields the final power torenaturalize Venus’ body” (1993, 133). However, although one might well argue that Venus desires whiteness and its privileges, she never attempts to pass as white; she does not cross racial lines in the film (as she does gender lines) unless we, through a complete substitution of gender for race, consider any drag to be a subversion of whiteness, in which case whiteness becomes, as Richard Dyer powerfully argues, everything and nothing at once (1988, 45–46).<br>

Abstract: When this Hegelian journey of self‐transformative
         Erfahrungis envisaged more concretely as a project of strategically intentional interreligious hybridization, two concomitant prongs of interreligious engagement take shape as its necessary moments. First, in order for an interreligious engagement to involve one’s self‐transformative encounter with the other’s self‐disclosure, it must embody some form of learning about the other in an undistorted way by means of dialogue and immersion in the other’s ideas and practices within a context of mutuality and equal participation. From the perspective of Christian theology, the newly emerging discipline of comparative theology, pioneered by Francis Clooney and others, here offers a model.35Comparative theology demands that I acquire as the proper context of my theological practice both an in‐depth understanding of the texts, symbolisms, rituals, and practices of other religious traditions and a stance of openness and vulnerability to the transformative power of their truth claims, so that my reading of my own Christian tradition may be carried out as an act of self‐critical and nonidolatrous commitment to its distinct claim to truth.36<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 83. For Tesauro, the metaphor of the saint as shield is of great relevance. If in
            SympathyMaurice and the shroud are the shields of the Catholic Savoy family, inEdipo(Oedipus, 1661), Tesauro’s interpretation of Seneca’s tragedy, Oedipus is the shield that prevents the divinity from exerting his power of purification. In Tesauro’s tragedy, Oedipus holds a long monologue on the “voracious plague” that afflicts the city of Thebes. A praetor replies to the Oedipus that the heavens are merciful because “they oppose your [Oedipus’s] virtue like a shield against their own furor.” See Emanuele Tesauro,Edipo, ed. Carlo Ossola (Venice: Marsilio, 1987), 1.1, verse 4, 79, and verses 47–48, 80. We could thus say that, for Tesauro, Maurice is a sort of anti‐Oedipus who has made himself into a lucid mirror of the shroud (the shield reflecting divine will). The saint’s body is a transparent surface reflecting and “actualizing” the “symbol” of the shroud. By contrast, Oedipus’s ignorance of his sins is a darkened, blind shield that prevents the divinity from shining through.<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: Obedience to God unifies Christ’s identity by incorporating his powerless submission to the circumstances in which he finds himself and his love of neighbor. As Frei notes, at several central points in the passion narrative, where Jesus is powerless, he nonetheless turns others’ power to his own ends—either by appropriating their words or reshaping the significance of their action. Moreover, Jesus’s agency is far stronger in the Gospel of John than in the Synoptic Gospels.
         44John’s portrayal of Jesus’s agency also progressively emphasizes Jesus’s unity with the Father, such that what is presented at the beginning as the Father’s intention becomes Jesus’s own through the course of the story.45Frei presents this conjunction as demonstrating that one cannot simply highlight Jesus’s powerlessness in the Synoptic Gospels; rather, to be faithful to the narrative one must grasp both his power and his powerlessness, in these disparate depictions. This exemplifies what one might call a “narrative typology,” which, like Midrash, conjoins apparently disparate or conflicting texts so as to deepen the literal sense.<br>

Abstract: While giggles erupted from all corners of the room, I couldn’t help wondering if the constant assertion of God’s control over events didn’t in some way diminish these students’ sense of moral obligation to act in the world. After all, if all events follow God’s plan, regardless of what one chooses to do, why then act in ways that risk one’s safety?
            16Why “follow God’s law” if you can experience God’s history, and live and die within God’s embrace, feeling less pain than those who are not saved? If you’re saved through belief, then what propels ethical action? Mrs. Barrett herself had said that the Al Qaeda attackers had “seized the power that should have been given to God and didn’t allow God to work through the situation.” Was the Holocaust a situation that God “ought to work through” or one where people ought to intervene? Only one student, Kira, eventually volunteered that she would hide Jews, that she would choose God’s laws over the Gestapo’s, regardless of the risks to herself and her family.<br>

Author(s): van der Ven Johannes A.<br>
Abstract: A critical analysis of the Vatican II document on freedom of religion brought me to the conclusion that people are indeed free in their choice of a religion, but this freedom, at least for Catholics, ceases once they have accepted the faith. Then only obedience to the institution representing the church’s doctrinal authority counts. Whoever does not submit to this authority can expect some form of punishment, for example, a reprimand, a warning, denial of the sacraments (which seems to be the case in the United States in 2004 with John Kerry, the Catholic presidential candidate, who is in favor of prudential abortion laws and stem cell research), compulsory public recantation, suspension, expulsion from office, laicization, and excommunication. Thus it is often stated in defense of the church—at least the Catholic Church—that it is a case of the “right of truth” versus the “right of the person” and that the latter is obviously subordinate to the former.
            29But if one is to avoid lapsing into personifying abstractions, the right of truth is tantamount to the right, hence the power, of a particular group to dictate to others what the truth is, so the right of the person is set up in opposition to the right of the group, here the church’s doctrinal authority.30<br>

Abstract: The paradox is that the mausoleum was imposed in 1949 as a public symbol and barely existed as private thought. Today, it is physically excised from the public space but is present as an architectural specter in one's private spatial memory: “Let's meet at the mausoleum!”
         103This will be the case until the generations that have seen it will themselves have passed away, and with them any trace of individual memory of the mausoleum will be demographically cleansed. This should bring at last the private and public closure of the mausoleum of Georgi Dimitrov in Sofia. Koselleck has remarked that “political experiences or messages can only be passed down beyond the death of a particular generation with great effort. To this end, societal institutions are required. In any case, the memorial, the supposed guarantor of sensory transmission beyond death, does not appear to be capable of achieving this task by itself. A conscious adoption of the message is always necessary.”104The demolishers seem to have overestimated the power of the memorial.<br>

Abstract: My own interpretation of the significance of childhood for theological ethics—in all of children’s empirical, religious, and social dimensions—reflects normatively the kind of postmodern hermeneutical perspective I have been advancing. That is, childhood calls society to be “fruitful and multiply” in a circular, self‐disruptive, asymmetrical, and ongoing self‐transforming sense. From a child‐centered point of view, human moral responsibility includes responding to the vulnerabilities of others—such as their poverty, incapacity, or powerlessness—in a self‐creative and socially creative way. What must be disrupted or recreated most of all is the world of those who hold social opportunities and power. Marginalized members of society such as children are not only “other” in the negative sense of demanding not to be oppressed but also “other” in the positive sense of requiring a different and new response from those who influence their lives.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: Human community under such fragile circumstances constantly devolves into a community of mere difference alone. The original sin, from a poetic point of view, is the failure to embrace our own deeper capabilities for creating ever more inclusive social worlds. The possibility for a living creative tension among others is on some level always already defeated by the use of human creative faculties in merely limited ways, by historical stasis and consolidations of power, and by all too human anxieties that leave us naked and ashamed before one another. In symbolic terms, the invisible “fruitfulness” of social generativity in the image of a Creator is inevitably (if understandably) overcome by the idolatrous temptation of the visible “fruit” of a fixed and tangible “knowledge of good and evil.” The products of creative life are mistaken for creative life itself. Moral uncreativity is perhaps similar in this respect to bad literature: repetitive of worn‐out clichés (as also in Hannah Arendt’s description of the overwhelming reliance on clichés by Adolf Eichmann), lacking a more inclusive movement and tension, or uninvested with openness to larger and wider meaning.
         35In any case, the challenge for us morally creative beings is to turn tensions of fear and division in human relations into tensions of inclusive production and multiplication. It is to imitate the Creator’s perfect Sabbath, which is no mere final stasis but a living harmony of the ongoing differences between night and day, land and water, plants and animals, and the whole Creation in all its marvelous and interacting diversity. The expulsion from the Garden of Eden is a loss, from this perspective, not of placid amoral inactivity but of the vital capability for generating, on the basis of human multiplicity and otherness, an ever more complex and diverse narrative of humankind.<br>

Abstract: To anticipate a criticism of the use of Habermas’s discourse ethics, there should be acknowledgment of Bent Flyvbjerg’s opinion, which is shared by a number of people: “The basic weakness of Habermas’s project is its lack of agreement between ideal and reality, between intentions and their implementation” [
      36, p. 215]. In directly countering Habermas’s discourse ethics, Foucault says, “The problem, then, is not to try to dissolve [power relations] in the utopia of completely transparent communication but to acquire the rules of law, the management techniques, and also the morality, the ethos, the practice of the self, that will allow us to play these games of power with as little domination as possible” [37, p. 298]. However, Habermas does admit, “Bargaining processes are tailored for situations in which social power relations cannot be neutralized in the way rational discourses presuppose” [38, p. 166]. Their positions are not so far apart, and the common ground is the ethics of the discursive practice. Furthermore, Habermas and Foucault share some phenomenological justification for their positions. Communication may not be transparent, as the Habermasian ideal would prefer, but neither is power a totally corrupting force. There are times when the discourse in librarianship will be agonistic (competitive and possibly strained); an agreed‐upon set of rules for ethical communication is still the most effective antidote to disruption and authoritarianism and assurance of rights being recognized.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Addressed to finite beings, the selfless gift is constitutive of their singularity; it also condemns such singular beings to guilt inasmuch as they are responsible. Furthermore, the gift of responsibility that occurs in the
      mysterium tremendumis a gift by a self‐denying and self‐effacing Goodness, who also remains inaccessible because of its very withdrawal. To be responsible is, in Patočka’s words, to stand in an inscrutable relation to “a Person who sees into the soul without being itself accessible to view” and “in whose hands we are not externally, but internally” (HE,pp. 107, 106). That which makes me responsible is something that remains impenetrable to me—in other words, secret. It is also something that shatters me because I cannot adequately respond to such a self‐denying gift. Thus, Platonic responsibility is a function of what Patočka terms looking‐in, or looking‐into‐what‐is (nahlédnutí)—namely, into eternal being—which like the Platonic Good can effectively be known. Christian responsibility, however, is not in the power of the subject, who is overpowered, crushed by it precisely because its source—self‐renouncing and self‐withdrawing Goodness—remains unfathomable.14Finally, as Derrida puts it, the gift of responsibility is a gift by “a goodness whose inaccessibility acts as a command to the donee. It subjects its receivers, giving themselves to them as goodness itself but also as the law” (GD,p. 41)—that is, as a universality to which the donee is subject as a singular and irreplaceable being. As the result of this gift, Christian responsibility, therefore, takes the uniqueness and irreplaceability of the singular individual into account precisely by subjecting him to a universal Law.<br>

Abstract: Wall claims that “moral life is inherently creative” and that this fact “demands a fundamental rethinking of the nature and meaning of moral life itself” (vii). For Wall, creativity is a possibility that is primordial to human being, ultimately expressing humans’ imitation of the creative power of God. The importance of creativity has been covered over by a tendency in the West to separate poetics from ethics. Wall aims to remedy this lack by explicating moral creativity as the capacity to invent an ever more inclusive vision of life. This moral creativity is developed in stages, from the being of the moral self as a creative tension of freedom and finitude (chap. 1), to the capacity of humans to bring narrative unity to their moral lives (chap. 2), through the poetic response demanded by otherness (chap. 3), to the creation of ideologies and utopias in social life (chap. 4). As an original contribution to moral reflection, this book has much to recommend it. While it is certainly not unusual today to see a call for ethics to become poetic, in postmodernism this usually means abandoning ethical reflection in favor of poetic invention of self or community. Wall manages instead to link poetic creativity to philosophical reflection, making creativity the symbolic ground of discourses of philosophical anthropology, teleological and deontological ethics, and social critical/liberationist thought. Wall’s use of specific narratives is likewise fruitful: tragedy is used for reflection on the status of moral evil and limitation, while the biblical creation story is interpreted to symbolize the potentialities of creativity. In sum, the book delivers on its promise to heal the divide between poetics and ethics, rather than simply replacing ethics with poetics.<br>

Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: Characteristic of this new attitude toward the past are the closing words of Sanders’s recently published volume,
         Adaptation and Appropriation(2006), in the Routledge Critical Idiom series. Opening her final paragraph with the claim that “We need then to restore to the subgenres or practices of adaptation and appropriation a genuinely celebratory comprehension of their capacity for creativity, and for comment and critique,” she concludes: “Adaptation and appropriation … are all about multiple interactions and a matrix of possibilities. They are, endlessly and wonderfully, about seeing things come back to us in as many forms as possible” (Sanders2006, 160). This is the rhetoric of hedonistic liberalism, celebrating multiplicity and pluralism for its own sake, for the choices it allows; it is Fredric Jameson’s postmodernity whose “relationship to the past is that of a consumer adding another rare object to the collection, or another flavour to the international banquet” (1998, 129). Typically, there is no word about the future re‐vision might help to envision, no sense of “memory as a means to liberation” (Greene1991b, 291), of the interlocking of memory and the feminist project, of looking back in order to move forward. On the left, concerns about the disappearance of the future and capitalism’s increasing monopoly on it are growing, as are laments about the loss of a sense of historical time as a teleology moving away from a past from which we could learn and into a future that would be different (see Gumbrecht2004, 120; see also Jameson2005). There are those who are bitter about it, complaining, as does Terry Eagleton inAfter Theory(2003), that “Over the dreary decades of post‐1970s conservatism, the historical sense had grown increasingly blunted, as it suited those in power that we should be able to imagine no alternative to the present” (Eagleton2003, 6–7).

Abstract: If one considers all the books that line the shelves of any given library as a collection, including the acquisition of materials for that collection, its accessibility, and its dissemination, a unique concern about truth is revealed. Consider any given library as a record of humanity’s accomplishments and failures. Both the beauty and the ugliness of humanity’s history must be represented in this collection. Sadly, however, this balanced perspective about humanity’s accomplishments and failures is often compromised by a number of factors. One such factor, often affecting public libraries, is the decision to avoid community outcry concerning controversial material. Such material could be different lifestyle perspectives, negative views of various stages of American or world history, art or literature that is deemed morally offensive, and hate literature. Regardless of the truth value of the propositions and perspectives contained in such controversial literature, the truth value must be suspended so that a complete picture of recorded history is not compromised. If the historical record is compromised, any and all theories of truth would be compromised. To what end would an individual or some group in society want this? Just as it is often said that knowledge is power, the compromising of knowledge puts that power in the hands of the compromiser.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Still, the book has significant shortcomings. First, it suffers from a bad case of sprawl. Reynolds attempts to engage the following thinkers at some length: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Hans‐Georg Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Gottfried Herder, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean‐Francois Lyotard, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Ricoeur, Richard Rorty, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Charles Taylor, Paul Tillich, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Dozens more receive passing mention. This, however, is nothing compared to the book’s many arguments. Reynolds forwards vast theses not only in philosophical theology and the theory of religion but also in hermeneutics, epistemology, and ethics. For good measure, we also get a typology of world religions (162) and an interpretation of the Enlightenment (22–41). Sheer breadth, of course, is not necessarily a weakness. It can be an impressive sign of intellectual power and agility. In this case, however, it comes at the expense of nuance. Consequently,
      The Broken Wholesometimes reads more like a term paper for a graduate survey course than a focused monograph.<br>

Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: Marcel understands that no preconceived notion of life and death, either materialistic or spiritualistic, may help him recover his “mutual predestination” with the soul of his grandmother. All he has to start from is “the originality of his pain”; he must “respect [it]” and follow therefore the logic, which death substituted to the cohesion of his and his grandmother’s souls, “of the mutual grafting in [him] of survival and nothingness.” This logic is bound to remain “incomprehensible” both to his “intelligence” and to his “faint‐heartedness” (which in this specific instance stands for an indolent facet of personal will). But it would be wrong to domesticate, as “intelligence and will” are eager to do, this incomprehensible logic by attributing the consolation of a life‐after‐death to his grandmother. His grandmother’s soul may only be resurrected via the resurrection of Marcel’s lost self, the self that was his soul at the time when his grandmother and he shared a “mutual predestination.” In order to attain the “resurrection” of his own self, Marcel evades the control of intelligence and volition by taking refuge in the world of sleep; and in “the organic depth … of his own viscera,” which stands here for the symbol of his own mortality, he finds the self that his grandmother’s death took away from him. “World of sleep in which our inner awareness, subordinated to the troubles of our organs, speeds up our heartbeat or our respiration, because the same dose of fright, of sadness, of remorse acts with a power a hundred times greater when thus injected into our veins; as soon as we start cruising on the black streams of our own blood as if on the sixfold coils of an inner Lethe, to travel the arteries of the buried city, tall solemn figures appear to us, approach us and then walk away, leaving us in tears.”

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: Deleuze, no less than Bordwell, lashed out at semiotics and psychoanalysis in part because they reduced the power of the films they tried to explain. Both men effectively bracketed what passed for the film theory of the day and instead put themselves in dialogue with classical theory, especially with theorist‐cineastes like Epstein and Sergei Eisenstein. It was once again legitimate to give serious attention to the major theories—some of them at least—and not simply as background to a professionally constituted field of theory. Returning to strong thinkers, like returning to strong films, always was Deleuze's method, although he was nevertheless a philosopher who prized creativity and the future above all. The stupendous number of films Deleuze cites and from which he elaborates his concepts shows him to be a devotee of the ciné‐clubs that we know he fervently attended in the postwar years.
         46Indeed, the first effect of Deleuze's cinema books was to bring largely canonical movies back to American film studies for serious consideration, after a decade devoted to audiences, to special‐interest films, and to television. Deleuze, along with Serge Daney (onetime editor ofCahiers du cinéma, small bits of whose writings made it into English), heartened those of us who felt the field to be malnourished when cut off from the kind of intellectually rambunctious film analysis that thrives in Europe. I was particularly gratified that both men reconnected with the fundament of theCahiers du cinémaapproach, acknowledging Bazin as an indisputable wellspring and following his practice of writing expansively and creatively about a variety of films chosen with discernment. Deleuze's cinema books urged us to return to the movies and did so at the very moment when this became possible, as university libraries had begun to acquire VHS and Betamax cassettes. What a pleasure it was to teach Deleuze in the late 1980s and early 1990s with this new resource. In my own seminar, each ~<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: Susanne Mrozik’s
      Virtuous Bodiesrepresents a significant contribution to this current rethinking of religion and Buddhist studies. The author explicitly locates her approach within the interdisciplinary field of feminist studies while also effectively placing the subject of her analysis, Śāntideva’sCompendium of Training(Śikṣ āsamuccaya), in dialogue with the work of such scholars as Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Grosz, Paul Ricoeur, and Charles Hallisey. In one respect, this study can be seen as quite traditional: the author develops her argument through a close reading of an influential Buddhist text, paying careful attention to the subtleties of its Sanskrit vocabulary and attempting to situate it within the medieval North Indian monastic milieu within which it took shape. This textual analysis provides the basis on which Mrozik advances toward the first stated goal of her work, to correct “the widespread misconception in scholarship on Buddhism and Buddhist ethics that South Asian Buddhists (with the exception of practitioners of Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism) ascribed little value to bodies” (6). And Mrozik succeeds admirably in this regard, skillfully articulating how diverse and often seemingly contradictory perspectives on human embodiment come together in support of a religious ideal in which the “bodied being” (ātmabhāva) of bodhisattvas, interacting with the bodies of those whom they aim to liberate, plays a foundational role. Having first identified two dominant and contrasting somatic discourses in theCompendium of Training, one “physiomoral” and the other “ascetic,” Mrozik argues that the text presents a coherent ethical perspective, one in which “an ascetic discourse is in service of producing a range of virtuous bodied beings, valued for their physical as well as moral qualities” (116). As she notes, ascetic disciplines are grounded in an implicit assumption that embodiment matters greatly, even if these disciplines or “technologies of the self” ~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Despite the evidence marshaled above, the proposition that language works against itself in prayer, stressed to the breaking point by a crisis of referentiality, may still provoke understandable resistance given Coleridge’s sacramental investment in language via the Logos elsewhere (e.g., in
         Biographia Literaria). However, it is a proposition that makes sense if we remember that prayer is fundamentally an act of response made from the condition of human fallenness. TheOpus Maximumis helpful here, depicting a complex but suggestive relationship to Logos. One of its ongoing concerns is to clarify the divine origin of reason (a theme tellingly introduced for the first time via an analogy with language).48Reason in its objective aspect is Logos and fully divine. However, reason in its subjective aspect, as belonging to individuals, is best described as a flawed “act of self‐direction …of opening and of receiving, which may … exist in very different degrees …counteracted or suspended or even suppressed” (emphases mine).49Reason is the Johannine light that “lighteth every man” (John 1:9), offered by God, but human reason is the eye opened imperfectly to that light. Insofar as humanity shares in or responds to the Logos, it does so only in a flawed way that must betray the separation between human and divine wills: “Reason is the presence of God to the <Human> Will independent of its unity with the divine Will. … A Reason that did not contain itself a power of opposing a Reason, or of not being one with it, would be no Reason at all.”50<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: The claim that Joyce is the culmination of Christian epic is less persuasive, and part 2 relies too heavily on the work of Gian Balsamo and Altizer. Franke’s contribution is to interpret linguistic repetition in
      Finnegans Wake(London, 1939) as a secular reformulation of negative theology and typology that cannot be definitively interpreted as the death of God. However, I suspect Franke accepts a historical trajectory in which secular literature displaces traditional religion as revelation. If anything, his theological interpretation of Celan, Stevens, and Joyce deconstructs our conventional notion of the secular and demonstrates that literature cannot escape theology. My concern is that we must be careful not to privilege such literature—as the fulfillment of literary or theological tradition—but recognize that Joyce speaks theologically as one voice among many. In short, Franke needs to clarify the role of Joyce in his theoretical argument about poetic language and his practical effort to promote meaningful dialogue. Presumably, Joyce illustrates the apocalyptic power of literature, but does he do so in a way that is representative or superlative in literary or theological terms?<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: D'Holbach's caveat is essential for understanding the implications of his system for the relationship between person and nature, but also between the transcendent and the immanent. If nature is meant to assume the role once assigned to the divine in Christian theology, it does so in an entirely different manner—not as an all-knowing, all-powerful subject, but as a blind and will-less force. At the same time, the human person is both identified with and in large part reduced to an effect of this force. D'Holbach's abandonment of transcendence in his materialist system thus drastically altered the relationship between God and soul as it was understood in orthodox religion. What had been an exchange between two distinct, albeit unequal persons, was reduced to an arrangement between two objects. The meaning of immanence likewise changed. Once mainline Christian theology began to assert the self's inward transcendence vis-à-vis the world as “masters and possessors of nature” (to cite Descartes), atheist philosophes such as d'Holbach reacted by asserting the immanent power of things to dispossess the self in order to repudiate the concept of divinity that stood behind it. However, this was no mere reversion to the world of “enchantment.” While d'Holbach was momentarily willing to anthropomorphize nature for rhetorical effect, he and Spinoza persistently applied the mechanized organization of the universe to human beings as well. In lieu of the semitranscendent, personified objects of the enchanted universe, one was left with the prospect of a world inhabited by wholly immanent, objectified entities.<br>

While Agamben’s analysis of potentiality issues in a being that forever retains its own power while giving itself to itself in actuality, being promised communicates itself to another, to the one outside of itself and so offers itself in a differential (the token) so as to fulfill itself to another. Thus, we can see that another kind of possibility is needed to reconstruct the political. The promise addresses, refers, and performs; this is the case even if the promise is in some sense creative of the one that the promisor addresses, as is the case of giving new names to Abram and Sarai. Contrast this with a pure gift that never arrives, never is present to consciousness. The pure gift may interrupt, but it does not create in the way that a gift as promise does. It, as Tillich pointed out, may criticize and negate without ever saying “Yes” or issuing in new forms, actions that all preserve the purity of the gift from any exchange. The pure gift only dwells in the negative, shattering ordinary attempts to fulfill the demands of reciprocity by offering in return a gift of equivalence. Promise issues itself into the field of exchange.<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Just as literature effaces the proper meaning of words, imposing a slippage that leaves the reader with no firm ground to stand on, so this essay effaces the proper meaning of Lévinas's text. To return to Blanchot's letter to Malka, it reveals to us finally what Blanchot meant when he said that in a
         certainway Judaism was so close to him that he could not speak of it. In what way is Judaism close to Blanchot? This proximity is one that must be announced as a distance. In maintaining that distance is not Blanchot declaring himself more loyal than Lévinas to the teaching of deracination, of which Blanchot considers Lévinas to be the teacher? In his letter to Malka and in his rewriting of Lévinas's essay “Heidegger, Gagarin, and Us,” Blanchot is answering Lévinas's call for Judaism to announce a new teaching to the postwar world. Undoubtedly Lévinas intended this call to strengthen both the Jewish community and the broader perception of Judaism's message. Blanchot's interpretation could be interpreted as doing the opposite. At the very least, it ignores the pragmatics of Lévinas's concerns. Yet, for Blanchot, Judaism's political power is only realized in renunciation. Its highest teaching, he suggests, is that there must be a gap between the call and the one in whose name the call is made. This is a space that literature discloses, offering us a mode of political speech that does not operate on the principle of mythical identification but rather ceaselessly interrupts itself, reminding us that fulfillment is not yet.<br>

Abstract: Setting aside the numerous references to falcons and falconry that have long been recognized as suggesting Dante's acquaintance with the birds, with hunting, and possibly with Frederick the Second's
         De arte venandi cum avibus,52let us look at the metaphors and similes in which he shows his knowledge of creatures. Through poetry, in contrast to philosophy—and even if this were not his purpose—Dante can potentially think his “way into the existence of a bat or a chimpanzee or an oyster, any being,” as J. M. Coetzee describes the power of poets inElizabeth Costello(80). Poetry, in other words, is a means whereby the subject can radically transcend itself in relation to the world of creatures.53This argument, of course, rests on the precise status or function of these similes or analogies in the poem.<br>

Issue: 656725<br>
Date: 01 01, 2011<br>
Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: If that is indeed the case, it is our historical duty to realize that the rhetoric of
      Confessionscomprises both sound and silence to the effect that the fullness of voice can sound in such a way that it is possible to say about Augustine—and his reader—that he “did not hear [its] silence.” Is that perhaps the essence of the fact that what Augustine is looking for cannot but be a momentary gift and that the rhetoric of this search in all its loudness comes down to shaping the fact that it cannot be ascertained, beyond the “speech act” ofconfessioitself, whether that which is given sounds or not? Saying this, we do not find ourselves in the realm of mystical silence. We are, rather, faced with the demands of rhetorical precision. For to establish the magic of a language of desire that is given—a language with the power of Kafka's hammer of the facts of life in the shape of the song of the Sirens—confessiohas to be framed and shaped, dramatized and theatricalized. Consequently, the possibility has to be taken into account that the phrase “Ulysses did not hear the silence of the Sirens” is not the final word about the matter, just as the dialectic of speech and silence cannot be taken to function as an automatism.<br>

Author(s): Walton Heather,<br>
Abstract: What does this tensional approach look like in practice? A few noteworthy examples illustrate the scope of this collection. In her own essay, Walton destabilizes the conventional hetero-normative ordering of the disciplines. With Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, Walton seeks to reclaim the metaphysical power of the feminine (and the literary) through a genuine “honouring of difference” that stresses “alterity rather than complimentarity” via tension without hierarchy (43). She demonstrates this through brief but insightful readings of Toni Morrison’s
      Beloved(New York, 1987), Ian McEwan’sAtonement(New York, 2002), and J. M. Coetzee’sElizabeth Costello(New York, 2003). Fiona Darroch examines the politics of representation in postcolonial Caribbean literature—specifically, the various ways the literature reimagines the sacred and thereby challenges Western conceptions of the religious and the sacred that persist within comparative religious studies. Finally, John O’Connor exposes the tendency of recent theological aesthetics (following Hans Urs von Balthasar) to ignore or oversimplify aesthetics since the Enlightenment. Theology thereby assimilates aesthetics and fails to take seriously the ambiguities present in actual aesthetic experience—namely, the tensions between our experience and our understanding of beauty as revelatory, including “the possible untrustworthiness of the imagination” (123).<br>

Abstract: This debate boils down to a moral debate. Realists claim that a moral commitment to a concrete group of real-life persons supervenes the infinite play of the signifier. They see constructionists as occupying a privileged, distanced, ocular place which ultimately devalues real world conditions, thus leading to political quietism. Constructionists are committed to an ideal of allowing the Other to be other. They see the very definitiveness which realists cherish as at least potentially the scholar’s own will to power, that is, the imposition of one’s own meaning onto the subsequently elided Other.<br>

Article Title: Contagion and Cognition: Bodily Experience and the Conceptualization of Pollution (<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 671448<br>
Date: 10 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Feder Yitzhaq<br>
Abstract: A similar correlation between phenomenal experience (odor) and the conceptualization of death pollution is found in other cultures. For instance, classical sources from ancient Greece and Rome attest to the belief that the house in which a corpse was found required purification and should be marked with a pine or cypress branch on its entrance to warn outsiders.
         
               Unfortunately, these references tend to be anecdotal, precluding further analysis. Modern ethnographic evidence, however, provides striking parallels which bear directly on the biblical case. Note, for example, the custom of Indonesians to scrupulously seal all of the cracks in a coffin from the concern that death will be spread with the odors. Herz writes: “The reason [Indonesians] consider it so highly desirable that the putrefaction should take place in a sealed container is that the evil power which resides in the corpse and which is linked to the smells must not be allowed to escape and strike the living.”70
            
               A comparable view is attested among the Cantonese who fear the “killing airs” (71
            sat hei) emitted by the corpse, which are thought to permeate the house of the deceased. Watson cites a local informant who describes the danger that the killing airs—associated with the departing spirit of the deceased—will cling to mourners “like an invisible cloud.”
               These parallels reflect a similar conceptualization of the power of death to spread in a manner corresponding to sense experience.72<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: The existence of two chronologically ordered passages has been acknowledged since Reinhold Agahd’s edition of the first and the last books.
         
               Fragments 35–39 of the first book of Varro’s42
            Antiquitates rerum divinarumlist the introductions of deities and cults into the city of Rome by the earliest kings (frags. 35–39 Cardauns = frag. 39a Agahd):
               This sequence was longer, as I will show shortly. The second chronological sequence occurs in book 15.(35) [Romulus] constituit Romanis deos Ianum Iovem Martem Picum Faunum Tiberinum Herculem
               (36) Titus Tatius addidit Saturnum Opem Solem Lunam Vulcanum Lucem…Cluacinam

               (38) During the reign of Numa religion did not yet consist of images or temples with the Romans. A parsimonious piety, poor rites, no Capitol-like splenditure, but temporary altars made of turf, and Samian [i.e., terra-cotta] vessels, the city of Rome was not yet flooded by the ingenuity of Greeks and Etruscans to form images.

Abstract: Like the first three chapters of Genesis, the story of Eve’s dream retains the power to surprise us on any given rereading by virtue of what it does not say. There is no mention of a voice, satanic or otherwise, and whatever Satan does here it involves treating Eve more as medical subject than as coy mistress. “Inspiring venom” might be read as a metaphor for “speaking evil words,” but the language of animal spirits in fact asks us to see something very different. Satan is inspiring Eve—literally pouring noxious matter into the porches of her ears. This attempt at material defilement has some causal relation to the dream voice as Eve articulates it the following morning, but in connection with what other catalysts we cannot say. We have no ground for asserting that Satan spoke, scripted, or serenaded. But such is the nature of Eve’s dream—always seducing us into making our own “additions strange” to Milton’s elliptical account.<br>

Article Title: Figures of Pain in Early Modern English Tragedy<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673118<br>
Date: 09 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Figurative language may not be a primary means of conveying painful sensation, but it is paramount in assigning significance to those sensations and affecting audience reactions to its portrayal—perhaps even coercing them into an interpretation they would otherwise reject. In the artistic and theatrical exploration of human suffering, metaphors and pain are intimately linked because it is this interpretive trope that cues audience response and assigns meaning to an otherwise horrifyingly senseless bodily experience. The figures of pain discussed here attest to the artistry of these playwrights, but also to the power of metaphor and other tropes to shape the thinking of an entire culture. As Wayne C. Booth writes of metaphor’s role in community discourse, “The metaphors we care for most are always embedded in metaphoric structures that finally both depend on and constitute selves and societies.”
   
            Early modern culture utilized numerous discourses to make sense of pain, from seeing it as a sign of devotion in the Petrarchan lover or religious martyr to construing it as evidence of guilt in systems of corporal or capital punishment. Early modern tragic theater draws on those cultural narratives, but it also serves as a space for practicing the types of interpretation needed to make sense of pain—an understanding that extended outward at the close of the play. By being attentive to the moments of spectacular suffering that define these plays, by noting the philosophical and affective purposes those spectacles serve, we can see at work the same systems of interpretation that made possible many early modern cultural discourses, from the literary to the judicial to the spiritual. Far from being irreconcilable, pain and metaphor work in conjunction in early modern tragedy to create a durable interpretive community out of a single, yet multifaceted, physical experience.51<br>

Abstract: Jeffrey A. Bell contrasts Voegelin's philosophy with Deleuze's in his essay, “Immanence/Transcendence.” According to Bell, Voegelin is guilty of vertical transcendence, such that the experiences of
         erosandthanatosare understood in the context of transcendence, whereas in Deleuze's horizontal transcendence, these experiences are understood in the context of immanence (97). Both Voegelin and Deleuze critique metaphysics, but only Deleuze succeeds at avoiding metaphysical reductionism, because he understandserosandthantosin the context of immanence. By rejecting a transcendental metaphysics, Deleuze is able to support a politics of multiplicity that avoids excessive centralization and chaotic decentralization. In contrast, Voegelin's view of transcendence leads him to accept a politics of hierarchy and centralized power.<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: The final chapter, which considers the
      Lex Mercatoria(1622) of the merchant Gerrard de Malynes, can stand for what is most distinctive about Anderson’s book. Like all that precedes it, it is the product of equal parts intense close reading and deep research. (The endnotes, fully a third again of the book’s length and set in smaller type, are a rich mine both of reference and reflection.) She unfolds Malynes’s body-soul-and-spirit allegory of “the three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke” (177) — commodities, money, and exchange — in order to show how he argues for the overriding economic importance of monetary policy. Malynes has his critics, both on account of his metaphors (which were disparaged by contemporaries such as Thomas Mun) and his theory (Mun again, and most modern economists). What Anderson is ultimately concerned to show, however, is how, for all of the potential intricacy of the relations between body and exchange, Malynes’s conceit is sterile, never transforming or vitalizing what I. A. Richards would call its economic tenor. His book had little power to change the way his contemporaries talked about money. Critics mostly celebrate the discovery of metaphorical overplus: here is a valuable lesson in how metaphor might fail.<br>

Abstract: One of the striking things about this anticlimax to creation in the Akkadian tradition is the way the work of literary parallelism clarifies not only the structure acquired by the cosmos—the division into relative parts: the heavens above and the earth below, the god Apsû (the personification of fresh water, from the Sumerian AB.SU, whence the Greek
            abissos) and the goddess Mummu-Tiamat (the personification of salt water, from the AkkadianTiamtu, sea), and so forth—but also the way creation itself takes place via the word, since the literary parallelism very clearly equates “calling by name” and “creating.” The events of “naming” and “existing”—being determined by the accentuation of the word and entering upon existence as a discrete entity that separates out from the initial indifferentiation (Apsû/Tiamat)—are overlaid (the lexicon of “naming”—shuma zakaru,nabu, se’u, shima shimu—also has clear connotations of determination, delineation, identification, and separation). This is spelled out thematically, rather than formally, further on in the poem, when Marduk positively deploys his destructive and creative power in the face of the challenge from the other gods: “‘At a word from you, let this Constellation vanish! /At another command, let it be whole!’ // At awordfrom him, by hiscommand, the Constellationvanished. / And at anothercommand, the Constellation wasrestored. // When the gods, his fathers, saw thefruit of his word, / Joyfully they did homage: ‘Marduk is king!’” (emphasis mine).<br>

Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-2<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks to bridge two aspects of Fronto's letters, erotics and rhetoric, by demonstrating that Fronto himself merges the two areas in his discourse with Marcus Aurelius about their relationship. Whereas some letters suggest an unequal relationship based on power, others encourage the identification of Fronto with Marcus. Fronto achieves this identification by structuring their relationship itself as a metaphor in which he and Marcus are equated and linked by epistolary bonds. I close by discussing why the epistolary genre in particular is an apt site for the merger of metaphor and love.<br>

Abstract: In volume six of
         Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d’ornithologie, Olivier Messiaen uses the phrase “the pebble in the water” to identify a class of especially stark rhythmic contrasts in Debussy’s music that feature long durations interrupted by rapid rhythms. He invests these contrasts with an expressive logic built around the concept of shock—that is, the sudden stimulation of a static context by an outside presence. Messiaen unites various images—both natural and psychological—around this expressive pattern via analogy, suggesting that its essence is transferrable within a network of associated metaphors. Although for the most part in volume six Messiaen refrains from linking interpretations of Debussy with his own music, many of his rhythmic contrasts manifest the same expressive logic that he ascribes to Debussy’s music, particularly durational events that signify the interjection of birdsong within serene environments and that signal the striking appearance of divine power on earth. In addition to stylistic and semiotic correlations, the logic of shock theorized for the pebble in the water recurs more abstractly in Messiaen’s idiomatic views on musical experience and spiritual encounter. His interpretation of rhythmic contrast bears the marks of his more general aesthetics of shock, which in turn can be read as a reorientation of a broader modernist hermeneutic.<br>

Abstract: Among other interpretations one should also think of this rhetoric as a means to justify the subdivision of power within architectural offices. Sociologist Judith Blau stated, in her
               Architects and Firms: A Sociological Perspective on Architectural Practice(Cambridge and London: MIT Press, 1987), 26, that in architecture similar training and shared knowledge create a bond between different echelons within the firm. Blau and Cuff (Architecture,130–37), demonstrate that this bond brings the sense of purpose to entry-level architects' every day activities—but it could also lead to subtle forms of exploitation. Clearly, the presentation of the production of working drawings as pleasurable and enjoyable was directed toward aspiring architects and the lower echelons of architects' offices, to encourage an understanding of the material qualities of a project, and this rewarding and pleasurable aspect of being an architect. See Woods,From Craft to Profession, 141–46, for her depiction of the complex mixture of camaraderie and exploitation that took place in architectural offices at the turn of the century.<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Article Title: Toward an Architecture of Critical Inquiry<br>
Publisher: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, Inc.<br>
Issue: i262148<br>

Author(s): Ito Botond<br>
Abstract: This essay investigates the roots of a growing impass in contemporary architecture vis a vis the economic, technological, social and political developments of our advanced or late-capitalist society. It focuses upon architecture's apparently diminishing capacity to address our present human condition, yet argues that the problems responsible for the "crisis" of architectural thought and design in general have evolved as the result of historic processes, and therefore the impass can only partially be explained with the short-comings of modern architecture or the 'short sighted' attitude of the architects themselves. Nevertheless, it also argues that architecture, in spite of its now rather limited transformative capacity, should persistently attempt to reveal, rather than mask or otherwise escape, its fundamental relatedness to material processes; that is, to the modes of production and consumption on which social and political power relations are predicated. To be able to do so, and thus to foster a more liberating "form" of human environment, the profession needs first of all a strong political self consciousness, while aiming at a practice of critical inquiry.<br>

Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
Issue: i262178<br>
Date: 2 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Bozdogan Samuel<br>
Abstract: The following essay considers Josep Lluis Sert's American Embassy in Baghdad (1955-1961) as an attempt to project a new basis for American political influence abroad that was compatible with a rapidly changing postcolonial world. Although the United States began its program of embassy construction to accord with its new role as a world power, the government required architects to be sensitive to local conditions of the site and the host country. In Iraq, this meant distinguishing America from both a rival Soviet Union and from England, America's ally but increasingly despised by Iraqis for its uninvited sway over their government, as well as addressing questions of climate and local construction capacities. To negotiate political complexities of the cold war and to balance American ambitions with local conditions, Sert drew on a modernism that was itself in the process of transition due in part to its application to a broader range of building types and social tasks, of which the embassy program is an instance, and in part to the representational pressures such institutional patronage entails.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i208500<br>

Abstract: This commentary article focuses on a crucial moment in the formation of Peruvian Creole nationalism: the 1836-9 Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation. Nationalist sentiments expressed through the anti-confederationist press, satiric poetry and pamphlets, glorified the Inca past while spurning the Indian present. During this period, a nationalist, essentially racist, rhetoric whose roots can be traced to the late eighteenth century, took shape. This rhetoric would provide the foundations of an ideology which has prevailed in Peruvian history. This rhetoric reached its peak in the twentieth century, while evolving into a historiographical discourse instrumental to the exercise of power and which is now in crisis.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i273563<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Yerushalmi Howard L.<br>
Abstract: Rather than viewing Freud as a presumptuous Viennese physician who late in life attempted to "apply" some of his provocative psychological speculations to various social phenomena, this essay argues that from first to last, Freud was a social theorist. Indeed, what drew Freud to the study of biology and medicine was precisely the hope of addressing scientifically the most fundamental cultural problems: the nature of man and his culture; the origins of religion, morality, and tradition and the nature of their extraordinary power; the sources of social order and disorder; the direction of contemporary cultural development; and, finally, the problem of how to live in a disenchanted and psychologically impoverished world. Reading Freud in this manner moves his "cultural" texts from the periphery to the center of his work and makes possible an appreciation of the more complex, coherent, and illuminating social theory that lies at its heart.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303114<br>

Author(s): White C. Allen<br>
Abstract: Kenneth Burke, like a number of contemporary theorists, believes that we inhabit structures of words and that they inhabit us. But Burke goes on to stress that we constantly shuttle between two very different linguistic modes: logic and narrative. We can translate any set of logical ideas into a corresponding story, replete with plot, characters, and images and framed in time. By such a move we gain the direction of a beginning, the momentum of a crossing, and the goal of an ending-and thus augment the power of our rhetoric. But our narratives may become too rhetorically powerful, as with those scapegoat narratives that lead to the sacrifice of innocent victims. So occasionally, for our own safety and the safety of others, we must translate the drama of a narrative back into its atemporal principles, where contradictions may become more apparent and the rush toward victimage may be checked. Burke illustrates all these doctrines using the first three chapters of Genesis and other classic texts.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20011187<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Topper Keith<br>
Abstract: In recent years a number of writers have defended and attacked various features of structural, or neo-realist theories of international politics. Few, however, have quarrelled with one of the most foundational features of neorealist theory: its assumptions about the nature of science and scientific theories. In this essay I assess the views of science underlying much neorelist theory, especially as they are articulated in the work of Kenneth Waltz. I argue not only that neorealist theories rest on assumptions about science and theory that have been questioned by postpositivist philosophers and historians of science, but also that the failure to consider the work of these writers yields theories of international politics that are deficient in several respects: they are "weak" theories in the sense that they cannot illuminate crucial features of international politics, they presuppose and sustain a narrow view of power and power relations, they reify practices and relations in the international arena and they offer little promise of producing the sort of "Copernican Revolution" for which Waltz called (or, more modestly, even a minimally satisfactory theory of international politics). In light of these shortcomings, I sketch an alternative approach to the study of international affairs, one that has been termed "prototype studies." I contend that such an approach provides scholars with a rigorous way of studying international politics, without being a theoretical science.<br>

Abstract: Working-class people perform class identities. These performances are marked with ironies in which working class symbolizes power and powerlessness. Such performances elide linear meaning-making in favor of poetic paradox and help us understand the contradictions of working-class life. "The New Deal," a chapbook by my great-grandfather, represents an occasion for understanding how one working-class person used language to consider his life's contradictions. The chapbook articulates a unique "working-class poetics" and suggests why rhetoricians ought to locate representations of the paradoxes of working-class life.<br>

Article Title: A Socio-Cultural Theorisation of Formative Assessment<br>
Publisher: Routledge Journals, Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i20462366<br>
Date: 2 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Crossouard Barbara<br>
Abstract: Formative assessment has attracted increasing attention from both practitioners and scholars over the last decade. This paper draws on the authors' empirical research conducted over eleven years in educational situations ranging from infant schools to postgraduate education to propose a theorisation of formative assessment. Formative assessment is seen as taking place when teachers and learners seek to respond to student work, making judgements about what is good learning with a view to improving that learning. However, the theorisation emphasises formative assessment as being a discursive social practice, involving dialectical, sometimes conflictual, processes. These bring into play issues of power in which learners' and teachers' identities are implicated and what counts as legitimate knowledge is framed by institutional discourses and summative assessment demands. The paper argues that, rather than only paying attention to the content of learning, an ambition for formative assessment might be to deconstruct these contextual issues, allowing a critical consideration of learning as a wider process of becoming. The article suggests a model that might be useful to teachers and learners in achieving this.<br>

Publisher: M. E. Sharpe<br>
Issue: i20628279<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Gödl Doris<br>
Abstract: Using the example of former Yugoslavia, specifically the Serbian and Croatian nations, this article examines the transformation of collective memory of aggression and victimhood by focusing on the content of national narratives. The article begins by examining narratives developed at the founding of Yugoslavia and proceeds to trace the reinterpretation of these narratives as a function of their political instrumentality—especially in Serbia and Croatia—for respective nationalist projects. In the end, the article provides tools with which to frame two questions: first, whether political and social stability is being created at the cost of forgetting and repression; second, whether a "policy of remembrance" is socially "desirable" in practice. Both forgetting and an instrumental "policy of remembrance" based on the power of revelation perpetuate aggressor—victim divisions: what is needed, rather, is a stable, systematic process of remembrance and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Chile's collective memory has been brutalized by state-implemented terrorism. This historical process has resulted in, among other things, a "torn collective memory." The history and memory of the period of so-called popular power (1970-1973) continue to be largely unknown. Oral history allows us to begin a slow process of historical reconstruction as well as to reflect on the construction of militant memories.<br>

Publisher: Society for Utopian Studies<br>
Issue: i20719896<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Öba cita l'episodio del Kojiki relativo alla vicenda di Metori e Hayabusa, ma anche
le poesie di donne come la Principessa Nukata o Ishikawa no Iratsume che compaiono nel

Vede estendersi, inoltre, l'impronta della stessa matrice culturale ai raffinati classici del
periodo Heian (794-1185), come il Genji Monogatari (Storia di Genji, scritto da Murasaki
Shikibu intorno al 1001) o l'Ise Monogatari (Racconti di Ise, metà X sec; anonimo). Per

Abstract: Actual efforts to use Michel FOUCAULT's ideas about discourse for empirical research induce a linguistic bias which misses FOUCAULT's interests in power/knowledge. Against such tendencies, this article argues for a grounding of discourse theory and empirical discourse research in the sociology of knowledge, especially in the German-based Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie, which follows the BERGER/LUCKMANN approach to knowledge. For the purposes of empirical discourse research on knowledge, the author first considers the interpretative dimension of research. Then, some conceptual tools for knowledge analysis are presented (interpretative scheme, classification, phenomenal structure, narrative structure). Third, drawing on grounded theory and sequential analysis, concrete work on texts is discussed. Finally, the article insists that discourse research should not be reduced to the analysis of spoken or written texts. Instead, different kinds of materiality—for example as dispositifs—have to be considered.<br>

Author(s): SEACHRIS JOSHUA<br>
Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Abstract: The use of Reason may take two different meanigns: the way of the rational and the way of the reasonable. The first one consists in computing from quantitative evaluations, the second one to deliberate from arguments pro and con. The first one is the way of Mathematics, as to the second, it is more traditionally the way of Politics and Law. All the societies have used the second to solve their social problems. The West only has used the first in the field of human relations. Consequently, we have a devaluation has endured the same destiny. The consequence of that alteration has been very spectacular. The West has got an incredible power. However, to-day, that tremendous efficiency faces limits of all kinds.<br>

Article Title: Ethical Formation and Subjection<br>
Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23244925<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Schofer Jonathan<br>
Abstract: Ethical formation in and through subjection is an extremely widespread pattern that is not limited to particular traditions, time periods, or regions. Examining this pattern requires us to integrate the study of power with the study of virtue and self-cultivation: power is productive of selves, and selves appropriate the ideals presented to or pressed upon them. This paper refines our approaches to power and ethics by showing that we need to address at least three facets of ethical formation and subjection: (a) material power relations, including the ability to kill, torture, punish, imprison, confine, observe, and censor; (b) discourses, and particularly figurative discourses, that convey conceptions of the self as well as ethical ideals; and (c) emotions and motivations of embodied persons who encounter norms and ideals.<br>

Publisher: Department of Sociology, University of Kansas<br>
Issue: i23250013<br>

Author(s): Chriss James J.<br>
Abstract: Alvin Gouldner's life and work is considered within the framework of his own attempt to fashion a reflexive sociology during the second half of his career. In the first half, Gouldner was a functionalist and dutifully contributed insights and theoretical innovations to the paradigm, even while remaining critical of Talcott Parsons' own version of structural-functionalism. Later, by 1962, Gouldner broke from the dominant tradition to become an outspoken critique of establishment sociology, in the process becoming more sympathetic to competing theories, especially Marxism. Eventually, Marxism, too, was found to be inadequate because of its lack of reflexivity, and Gouldner became further alienated from both traditions of sociology. Concomitantly, Gouldner was battling on personal and professional fronts in his role of social critic. He became increasingly hostile toward others for their willing compliance with prevailing cultural prescriptions, which he believed were robbing human beings of their agency, vitality, and will to power. Lacking authentic knowledge of oneself, one could not hope to create social theories which benefited society and contributed to the liberation of the human spirit. Gouldner was a tragic hero, for although he came to an understanding of the limitations of human strivings in creating socially beneficial social theory, and fought valiantly to establish a program to fill this lacuna, he ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of these insights because of his own hubris (on the personal front) and the internal paradoxes of reflexive sociology (on the professional front).<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: מסה זו עוסקת בסוציולוגיה של התרגום בתנאים של יחסי כוח תיאולוגיים וקולוניאליים בין שפות. בעקבות ולטר בנימין, פול ריקר, ז'אק דרידה והספרות הפוסט-קולוניאלית, אדגים כיצד תחומים בלתי ניתנים לתרגום הופכים את התרגום לאשליה משיחית. דרך דוגמאות מתוך ספרות הנכבה שנכתבה בערבית אני מבקש להראות כיצד התחומים הבלתי ניתנים לתרגום מוצפים במסמנים לא יציבים ובמצבים אפורתיים של מבוי סתום. למשל, השימוש במילה נכבה אינו עקבי אלא תלוי בהקשר של זמן הכתיבה וזמן התרגום. בערבית אפשר למצוא לבד מנכבה גם את המושגים כארת'ה, הזימה, נכסה ומאסאה. בעברית אפשר למצוא שימוש באסון, בתבוסה, בטרגדיה או בנכבה. גם המסמנים ההיסטוריוגרפיים ומסמני הזמן והמרחב בספרות הנכבה אינם יציבים אלא משתנים תמידית. תובנות אלה מציעות אסטרטגיות תרגום שמתבססות על הטיות זמן מתאימות (למשל זמן הווה מתמשך במקום זמן עבר), על היעזרות בהערות חיצוניות לטקסט ועל שערוב מסוים של העברית. What is translation under asymmetrical conditions of power? How do colonial and theological practices shape the relationships between languages? Drawing on Walter Benjamin, Paul Ricoeur, Jacque Derrida, and postcolonial literature in general, I show how untranslatable texts stemming from such asymmetry result in insurmountable gaps which render the messianic "perfect translation" impossible. Using examples from literature on the Palestinian Naqba, I examine how untranslatable texts (from Arabic to Hebrew) are inflated with unstable signifiers, which themselves are contingent on the time/space aspect of the translation. Using these examples, I demonstrate the extent to which translation from Arabic to Hebrew necessitates peculiar political and aesthetic strategies which are sensitive to colonial and theological conditions.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se analiza el trabajo de Natalie Z. Davis a partir de su compromiso con la historia de las mujeres. Una historia de las mujeres que la historiadora construye de la mano de una historia social renovada que, sin renunciar a una tradición que contempla el conflicto como motor de cambio, encuentra bajo la variopinta red de pertenencias sociales, rasgos identitarios que intervienen la relación individuo-grupo. Los espacios de poder y de disidencias se entrecruzan en el día a día, en el trabajo, el ocio, o los ámbitos de sociabilidad. En todos ellos, hombres y mujeres interactúan; hijos de una cultura común que tiende a definirlos en relación, pero en la que encuentran elementos suficientes para significar sus propios mundos. Using her commitment to women's history as a starting point, this article analyses the work of Natalie Z. Davis. This particular study of women's history that the historian makes in a renewed social history which without giving up on a tradition which has always used the conflict as a way to evolve, also finds identity traits that influence the relationship between the individual and his group in a variety of social issues. The spaces of power and dissidences intertwine in the day to day, in the workplace, in free time, or in areas of sociability. In all of these, men and women interact; as descendants of a common culture which tends to define them as one, but in which they finally find enough principles to define their own worlds.<br>

Abstract: By incorporating the battle of Waterloo into the events of their novels, Hugo and Stendhal create a portrait of its principal protagonist, Napoléon ler. Associated in one case with a spatial prison out of time and in the other case with a temporal exile out of space, the image of the emperor is that of a figure of power deprived of time and, consequently, of its legitimacy. Stendhal imprisons his character in the present to deny the reality of Napoleon's defeat. Hugo, on the other hand, exiles his character from the present to link the past to the future and propose a new model of heroism.<br>

Author(s): Vásquez Manuel A.<br>
Abstract: This essay offers some theoretical and methodological reflections on how the study of religion might look if we were to assume that complexity, connectivity, and fluidity are preponderant features of our present age, without ignoring the strong countervailing global logics of segregation, surveillance, and control. After characterizing transnational, global, and diasporic modalities of religion in motion, the essay explores the strengths and weaknesses of the analytical tools of flows, landscapes, and networks in the study of mobility. I argue that by placing power front and center, the concept of networks provides a necessary corrective to hydraulic models of flows and spatial metaphors of landscapes. These metaphors tend to overstate the pervasiveness of porous boundaries and movement or to privilege the hermeneutic and phenomenological dimensions of religious activity.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, Gary Leason advances a sweeping theory of religion as a specific technology of power which dissolves its own conditions of possibility. Religion, simply put, is its own gravedigger because the strategies employed to impose patterns of consistency and control on the messy reality of contradiction and contingency must eventually succumb to unmanageable paradoxes.<br>

Author(s): SSORIN-CHAIKOV NIKOLAI<br>
Abstract: This article critically revisits the Foucauldian perspective on modernity by exploring the constitutive importance of limits of transparency in relations of power and knowledge. It differentiates between Foucault's Panopticon as a model for modernity, which posits a total visibility of subject under modern gaze, and what I call cybernetic ways of knowing that posit the 'black box' of the inner self that is blocked from visibility. The case in point is a comparative study of two anthropologies — two groups of anthropological cadres — the American anthropologists who in the 1940s were involved in emerging Soviet studies, and Soviet anthropologists of the 1920s and 1930s who took part in Soviet reforms. The article draws attention to similarities in their perspective of images and notions of the enemy: the 'enemy of the people' within Soviet society and the Soviet society as the West's Cold War enemy. In doing so, the aim of this article is to develop an ethnographic perspective on state socialism that does not depend on a foundational dualist distinction between 'Soviet' and 'Western' or 'socialist' and 'capitalist' modernity as a starting point.<br>

Abstract: The myth of Śunaḥśepa (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7.13-18) constitutes a primary acknowledgment by brahmanic tradition of the existence of peoples living outside of the varṇa system. The principal themes of this account served as the grounds for a socio-religious ideology that continued to develop throughout the history of brahmanic literature. This ideology established an opposition between the center—authority, sacrifice and cows of the brahmin Vasiṣtḥa; and the periphery—antinomian power and asceticism of the non-brahmin Viśvāmitra, and haunt of marginals and their dogs. This ideology breaks down in late variants of this myth, in which the expanded universe of bhakti can even encompass the excluded. Le mythe de Śunaḥśepa (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7.13-18) constitue un premier constat par la tradition brahmanique de l'existence de peuples hors du système des varṇa. A partir des éléments principaux de ce récit, une idéologie socioreligieuse ne cessera de s'élaborer à travers l'histoire de la littérature hindoue. Cette idéologie opposera au centre, à l'autorité et au sacrifice du brahmane Vasiṣtḥa vivant par ses vaches, la périphérie : « chaos » dominé par le pouvoir antinomien de l'ascète non brahmane Viśvāmitra, où les exclus vivent par leurs chiens. Dans des variantes tardives de ce mythe, il y a un effritement de cette idéologie, du fait que l'univers élargi de la bhakti englobe même les exclus.<br>

Abstract: The law is, on the one hand, always to some extent an expression of the dominant political power and ideology, while on the other hand it is relatively autonomous towards politics and other value-normative social phenomena, such as morality, customs, and religion. Despite the fact that from the deepest ontological perspective the separate existence of law and politics is an illusion, this separation must be acknowledged and maintained in our social life. The more autonomous the law, the more it develops its specific ideology. The latter can either serve as an appropriate counterbalance to the excessive tendencies of politics, or it can be abused for different political purposes. In the first case, we can speak about the constructive role of the law vs. politics, while in the second case its role is (self)destructive. In the first case different checks and balances between law and politics serve democratic society, while in the second case the differences between both phenomena are blurred, which leads to authoritarianism or totalitarianism.<br>

Abstract: This article aims at explaining, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the formalist positivist method in answering the essential questions of constitutional Law, such as the validity of the constitutional norm, the sovereignty of the people which comes before the original constitutional act and the effects of a theory of values on the limitation of the revision power. On the other hand, it proposes an onto-axiological approach, which refers to the Philosophy of Law. A relevant methodology of constitutional science of Liberty helps the specialists to follow the progress of knowledge. It puts forward means for approaching the subject matter of science (the norm), the constitutional environment and the theoretical basis of the norm. Following this proposed method would help not only in describing the norms but also in checking their validity, their justification and their imperfection when compared with their aims. These thought processes are a never ending search, that is to say a characteristic of science itself.<br>

Abstract: Situé au nord ouest de la Chine et base de la guérilla communiste avant même l'arrivée de Mao Zédong en 1935, Yan'an a longtemps constitué, officiellement du moins, l'instant de pureté morale de la révolution chinoise. Les événements de la place Tiananmen en juin 1989, moment certes éphémère, ont définitivement mis fin au mythe de Yan'an, même si la réalité de cette révolution avait disparu bien avant. A son époque, Yan'an rayonna vers toutes les bases révolutionnaires et à travers toute la Chine, et ce, malgré le contexte de guerre et de révolution. Ce fut le moment de transition entre l'échec et le succès à la fois pour Mao Zédong en personne à travers son ascension au sein du Parti communiste chinois et pour le Parti lui-même. Les mots et la langue furent, à cet égard et plus que toute autre chose, d'une importance cruciale. "Faiseur de mythe", conteur, architecte moral, créant à la fois la logique et le texte de la révolution, Mao parvint à symboliser le discours hégémonique de la révolution chinoise comme l'unique culture politique possible. Les luttes pour le pouvoir menées par Mao s'articulèrent sur la prétention au monopole d'un "cosmos" défini par luimême autour d'une idéologie (le marxisme sinisé), d'un pouvoir de domination militaire, d'un pouvoir administratif, et d'un pouvoir intellectuel. Mao utilisa en effet ces quatre dimensions pour asseoir son autorité avec un savant mélange de finesse analytique et tactique que l'on retrouve aussi dans ses textes. Mais il se heurta à des compétiteurs à l'intérieur même du PCC. Aussi chacune de ces luttes révèle-t-elle une dimension différente du processus de monopolisation. Chacune était nécessaire mais même ensemble, elles étaient insuffisantes, en l'absence de l'ingrédient final, le capital symbolique. Situated in China's Northwest, and communist guerrilla base before Mao arrived, Yan'an hab been constituted during a long time, officially at least, the moral moment of the chinese revolution.

Abstract: This paper, a reply to Professor R. S. Downie's criticisms of our paper 'A Political Critique of Kantian Ethics in Social Work', both appearing in BJSW 19, 6, tries to answer the main charge against us of illegitimately bridging the logical gap between statements of value and statements of fact. In addition to this, we explicate further our original arguments that language and power are indissolubly bound to each other, and that a Kantian approach to social work theory and practice fails in trying to dissolve that relationship by finding a neutral, universal ground from which to derive ethical principles and judgements.<br>

Author(s): Sobel Richard<br>
Abstract: The analyses produced by the French 'regulationist' and 'conventionalist' schools of economic theory both complement and contradict each other. Adherents of the regulationist school fear that convention theory's 'soft consensualism' will cause it to lose its Marxist-Keynesian radicalism, while the conventionalists, on the other hand, seek to persuade the regulationists that they alone hold the microeconomic key to the relative theoretical impasse in which the latter are said to find themselves. It is absolutely essential for heterodox economics to have at its disposal an alternative theory of action with which to counter the homo œconomicus of neoclassical economics, which underpins the dominant mode of economic theorizing. Such a theory is lacking in both the regulationist and conventionalist schools, and is ultimately the missing piece in the heterodox jigsaw puzzle, without which radical institutionalism is condemned to remain a theoretical archipelago without any real power in the face of the neoclassical continent. We will investigate how, without always fully accepting it, these two schools point towards a common theory of economic action, for which we will attempt to prepare the ground.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le déb~<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: The paper offers a new model of genre. The model employs Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of plane of immanence, chaos, and, in particular, concepts and approaches of cognitive science. Genre in general and the film genre in particular are modelled as a multidimensional space with a network of vector sequences, as a plane of immanence with individual works in the role of concepts, as a cluster category without a centre. That genre model provides more explanatory power than the recent semantic-syntactical one.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the significance of the concept of culture for organizational analysis. The intersection of culture theory and organization theory is evident in five current research themes: comparative management, corporate culture, organizational cognition, organizational symbolism, and unconscious processes and organization. Researchers pursue these themes for different purposes and their work is based on different assumptions about the nature of culture and organization. The task of evaluating the power and limitations of the concept of culture must be conducted within this assumptive context. This review demonstrates that the concept of culture takes organization analysis in several different and promising directions.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's book Oneself as Another, represents a major achievement in the development of a philosophy of selfhood. By dialectically linking the self to otherness, others, and the Other, Ricoeur makes a substantial move beyond Modern philosophical theories of identity and selfhood. However, contrary to Ricoeur's own intentions, his unique formulation of selfhood defined in terms of the power-to-do, or conatus, ultimately inscribes the other within the circle of the self-same, and thereby fails to let the other be other.<br>

Abstract: Our objective in this article is to demonstrate why between 1901 and 1922 reformism in Italy remained a minority position among the members of the left-wing parties without which it failed to gain influence among the ruling classes. After explaining why we chose to study this particular period, we first show how the republican and socialist reformists were both criticized in their respective parties and bitterly fought by the liberals in power. In addition to these external difficulties, there were internal ones: the progressive positivist culture which characterized the ideology of Italian reformists was also shared by a part of the middle-classes. Especially after 1900 it became unable to appeal to the masses and to young people who were more and more fascinated by a dramatic and violent conception of history which was in contradiction with the reformist intellectuals'vision of the world. Finally, Italian reformism did not manage to fit in with the revisionist trend that was led in Europe by E. Bernstein. The third reason for the failure of this movement lies in the organizational weakness of the political reformist groups, which is to be understood through the study of the conflictual relationships between the P.S.I. and P.R.I. and their respective parliamentary groups. Revolutionary or reactionary logics prevailed over the strategies of emancipation of the people through democratic means. The failure of democratic reformism in Italy between the liberal watershed and fascism also constitutes the failure to implant a democratic political culture in this country.<br>

Abstract: Finke, pp. 41-42: "In the Middle Ages, torture was not regarded simply as a form of
punishment. It was, as Foucault has shown, a technique and a ritual, a semiotic system which 'must
mark the victim.' Torture inscribed on the victim's body the 'signs' of the ruler's power. It was
one of the most visible displays of that power, an art, 'an entire poetic' that competed with other
visual displays of theocratic rule. The marking of the victim's body signifies the power that
punishes. "In the 'excesses' of torture, a whole economy of power is invested". In her excesses,
the mystic becomes at once both torturer and victim. This, it seems to me, is the whole point. The
mystic's pain - her inflicting of wounds upon herself — grants her the authority to speak and be
heard."<br>

Abstract: Whereas the concept of "socialist rule of law" punctuated political discourse in the late 1990s, it is the idea of a "socialist harmonious society" that today casts a strange light, clearly more Marxist than Confucian, on Chinese legal reform. This theoretical framework turns law into a disciplinary principle dedicated to society's moral construction. If law is seen as an instrument for legitimizing power, it remains implicitly but primarily subordinate to the regime's durability. Although more and more ordinary citizens are seizing hold of normative tools being put at their disposal, the party-state, fearful of being outflanked, is seeking to snuff out the democratic ferment contained in forces it has itself unleashed.<br>

Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) prepared the ground for individual fighters on philosophical-literary topics in the twentieth Century. In his writings he chooses the most varying problems as a starting point for his assessment of the existing relations between the Church and the World. As Kierkegaard fights for the individual, he criticizes the power of the masses over the quality of life of the individual citizen. He also criticizes the moralizing attempts of the "paid" clergy to make their demands on the individual believer. Following Theodor W. Adorno, Kierkegaard is to be read with a permanent considération for Kierkegaard himself. Autobiographical notices make it clear, that he is caught up in a constant struggle with himself. His both happy and tragical relationship with Regine Olson, which ended when he broke off their engagement, was the décisive impulse for him to become a "religious writer". It is to his former fiancée and his father that he dedicates his life's work, in which mostly Pseudonyms – as an indirect way of communication – express his existence. Kierkegaard mentions three essential levels or stages of life: the aesthetical outlook on life and the ethical, both of which are "catégories", finally, the religious outlook, which is more an "atmosphère". These stages can both follow each other, and also pervade one another. They are accompanied by the borderline catégories of irony and humour. These three phases do not simply depict a mode of abstract thinking, but also deal with concrète situations in life, as are those involved in passion, fear, misery and despair.<br>

Abstract: Usando métodos da História e da Antropologia, investigou-se a prática do aborto no Sul do Brasil na primeira metade do século XX. O exame de fontes primárias e as entrevistas com mulheres idosas visaram auscultar um enorme silêncio em torno dessa prática que deixa poucos vestígios em termos de fontes históricas e que reveste de segredos a memória. O texto apresenta dados registrados pela pesquisa e reflete sobre a diversidade das representações em torno do aborto, as ambigüidades dos sujeitos em relação ao tema. A prática do aborto precisa ser entendida como estando inserida num contexto de poder. Os sujeitos operam com conhecimentos de várias origens e dentro de uma rede moral composta de malhas contraditórias. By using methods of the fields of History and Anthropology, this study investigated the practice of abortion in southern Brazil in the first half of the twentieth century. The examination of primary sources and interviews with elderly women intended to unveil a huge silence around this practice, which leaves very few historical sources to be investigated, and hides those memories. This text presents data collected by this survey and analyzes the diversity of representations over abortion and the ambiguities that this theme causes on the subjects involved. The practice of abortion must be understood as inserted into a context of power. The subjects operate from multiple sources of knowledge and within a morality network composed of contradictory elements.<br>

Abstract: Polish literary theory developed very quickly in the 1960's and 1970's. Its main field of research is structure of literary works, including versology, stylistics, narrative, literary communication, descriptive and historical poetics. It was mostly inspired by phenomenology and Roman Ingarden, a disciple of Husserl and founder of phenomenological theory of literary work, which focused on the intentional structure of literary work and its concretization by readers. The second important source of inspiration for Polish literary theory was structuralism, including Russian Formalism, the Prague Circle and original Polish literary researches before the Second World War. After 1989 the entire field of literary theory in Poland was deeply changed. Formalist perspective was replaced by research concentrated on broad cultural, political, and economical contexts of literature, its ideological determinations as well as forms of symbolic power reflected in a literary work. Literature itself is no more treated as structure or text, but rather as discourse, reflecting and at the same time forming social reality. Analytical tools are mainly provided by French poststructuralist theory, hermeneutics, pragmatism, American cultural studies, feminism and postcolonialism. Inspirée par deux tendances prédominantes : la phénoménologie (dont le représentant le plus important a été Roman Ingarden, disciple de Husserl et fondateur de la théorie phénoménologique de l'œuvre littéraire, centrée sur la structure intentionnelle de l'œuvre et sa concrétisation par le lecteur) et le structuralisme (y compris les influences venues du formalisme russe, de l'École de Prague, ainsi que des recherches polonaises menées avant la Seconde Guerre mondiale), la théorie de la littérature en Pologne s'est développée très rapidement dans les années 60 et 70. Elle s'est intéressée à la structure de l'œuvre littéraire (versologie, stylistique, narration, communication littéraire, poétique descriptive et historiqu~<br>

Abstract: All humans by nature desire to know and humans are distinguished from the rest of creation by the miracle of knowledge. If all cultures have developed their own forms of knowledge, the spectacular success of a certain form of knowledge, science, notably in the west, has frequently led to its being exclusively attributed to the west. Yet science remains only one of many forms of knowledge and the west only one of its producers. The success of the west has tended to marginalize other forms of knowledge and other contributions to knowledge and, thus to impoverish an otherwise potentially rich and complex world knowledge landscape. It has tended to inhibit or even prevent the development of a really universal, human-knowledge project. Its very success, due essentially to its sustained application to technology, has enabled the development of a false superiority over other forms of knowledge and a real power hegemony of the west over other peoples. The future of lasting peaceful co-existence in the world may depend, in part, on the emancipation of other knowledge modes and forms. De par leur nature, tous les êtres humains éprouvent le désir de savoir, et les humains se distinguent des autres êtres de la Création par le miracle de la connaissance. Bien que toutes les cultures aient développé leurs propres formes de connaissance, le succès spectaculaire, notamment en Europe, d'une forme particulière de la connaissance, la science, a fait que cette dernière a été exclusivement attribuée à l'Occident. Pourtant, la science ne représente qu'une des nombreuses formes de la connaissance et l'Occident n'est qu'un producteur de celle-ci, parmi tant d'autres. Le succès de l'Occident a contribué à marginaliser les autres formes de connaissance et autres contributions à la connaissance, et ainsi, a fini par appauvrir le paysage international de la connaissance, qui autrement, aurait pu être extrêmement riche et diversifié. Ce succès de l'Occident a fini par inhiber, voire empêcher le~<br>

Abstract: El texto busca mostrar cómo Pío IX y su más conocido documento, el Syllabus errorum, publicado en 1864, participan del fin de una era multisecular en la historia del catolicismo, caracterizada por la existencia de un dominio temporal pontificio, por un vínculo afectivo de la Iglesia católica con la monarquía como forma de gobierno y por la concepción de la fe católica como única vía para la salvación. Fin de una era, no solo desde la perspectiva de la vigencia de las instituciones, sino de las representaciones que las acompañan. La demostración se apoya en un análisis de los tiempos en que el pontífice y su documento se enmarcan, desde la perspectiva braudeliana de los tiempos históricos, así como en las categorías propuestas por R. Koselleck para el estudio de la experiencia del tiempo. This article aims to show how Pius X and his most famous document, the Syllabus of Errors, published in 1864, participated in the end of a centuries-old era in the history of Catholicism that was characterized by the existence of the temporal dominion of the Popes, close ties between the Catholic Church and monarchism as a form of government and the conception of the Catholic faith as the only road to salvation. This was the end of an era, not just from the perspective of the power of institutions, but also in terms of the representations that accompanied them. The article is supported by a Braudelian analysis of the times in which the Pope and his document belonged and makes use of the categories proposed by R. Koselleck for the study of the experience of time.<br>

Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's Western oriented, sometimes even nationalistically tinted and yet, in
its intention, normative view of culture, see A New Critique, vol. 2, pp. 266-68, etc. In his
Roots in particular, the Occident' is very central (ch. 1, §§ 3,17-25), as the following passage
illustrates: Ά truly scriptural view of history... knows that the great antithesis between the
ground motive of the divine revelation of the Word and the ground motive of the apostate
spirit operates [in history] in the power struggle for the future of western civilization' (p.
108). Yes, Dooyeweerd at one point even calls the Dutch national character, in view of its
calvinistic bent, its humaneness, its sober life-style, and the like, a 'normative type' of histor-
ical disclosure and differentiation (p. 82). See also the striking analysis by C. T. Mclntire in
'Dooyeweerd's Philosophy of History', especially pp. 104-5, together with the nuanced criti-
cism of S. Griffioen in 'De betekenis van Dooyeweerd's ontwikkelingsidee', pp. 105-7.<br>

Abstract: In the pertinent passage Dooyeweerd's view of the I as a transcendental concentration
point is contrasted with Kierkegaard's comment on the I (or self). Kierkegaard calls the self "a
relation which relates to itself, and in relating to itself relates to something else." This 'some-
thing else' is a power, namely: God. See Kierkegaard (1849, 43) and Glas (1995a, 74-76).<br>

Abstract: The main aim of this article is to offer a critical reflection on the need of rethinking the teachers' professional skills and their academic pathway, given the changes and current transformations (crisis, in its etymological sense). In fact, a series of changes, transformations, are identified and affect directly the educator's comprehension. Amongst others: the transformation of work bound up with the processes of the economic globalization, and the transformation of the learning environments imbued by the TICs; the population growth, a demographic transformation with geopolitics relevance, and finally, as a result from the previous ones, the raise in the migratory flows. Under this context, this paper tries to reconceptualize teachers' training and their depiction as professionals from the view of Gustav Mahler in his statement Tradition is the spreading of fire and not the veneration of ashes. Thereupon, some categories that help in the teaching update, are proposed and explained; such as authority (as reputation or moral authority, role model and, hence, less so as bare exercise of power), the personalization of education, the importance of home community (society), and, lastly, the alternation within school-society and work-study. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una reflexión acerca de la necesidad de re-pensar la profesionalidad de los docentes y de su itinerario formativo, a la luz los cambios y transformaciones actuales (crisis, en sentido etimológico). En efecto, se identifican una serie de cambios, de transformaciones, que afectan directamente a la comprensión del docente, del enseñante. Entre otros: la transformación del trabajo vinculada a los procesos de la globalización económica y la transformación de los entornos de aprendizaje imbuidos en las TICs; el aumento de la población, la transformación demográfica con trascendencia geopolítica; y por último, y como confluencia de las dos anteriores, el aumento de los flujos migratorios.

Abstract: Dieser Aufsatz greift auf die Forschungen des Altgermanisten Friedrich Ohly zurück, der die Geisteswissenschaften durch eine metaphern-orientierte Forschung neu stimulieren wollte: Metaphern, so Friedrich Ohly, seien nicht Restbestände, sondern Grundbestände menschlichen Lebens. Besonders die religiöse Sprache komme nicht ohne Metaphern aus. So sei die Beziehung zwischen Gott und den Menschen allein metaphorisch zu versprachlichen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird der metaphern-orientierte Zugang von Friedrich Ohly auf die Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ angewendet. Näherhin analysiert der Beitrag die Prägekraft der Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ mit Blick auf die Taufliturgie und die Tauftheologie der Alten Kirche. Unabhängig von seinem biologischen Alter – so geben sich die Jesus-Anhänger von Anfang an überzeugt – wird der Christ jung in der Taufe und bleibt jung, wenn er seine Taufberufung in Treue bewahrt. So seien als Schlüsselgedanken des vorliegenden Aufsatzes hervorgehoben: erstens die Taufe als geistliche Geburt und Anfang der Kindwerdung; zweitens die metaphorische Rede von der Taufeucharistie als Milch, welche als lebenslängliche geistliche Speise für die Gotteskinder gilt (1 Petr 2,2). This article examines the research of Friedrich Ohly, a medievalist who sought to stimulate spiritual understanding through thought which explored the significance of metaphor. For him, metaphors were not merely the remains, but parts of the active inventory of human life. Religious language, in particular, could not do without them. The relationship between God and man could be articulated only by metaphoric means. In this article Ohly's approach is applied to the metaphor of 'God's Child', or 'Divine Filiation'. The article seeks to analyse the power of the impression of the metaphor itself with a view to the baptismal liturgy and baptismal theology of the ancient Church. From the very beginning Christians had been convinced that new believers be~<br>

Abstract: On a souvent décrit la modernité en la rapportant à l'idée de sécularisation du politique : à la faveur de la « grande séparation » hobbesienne, le pouvoir serait devenu un lieu vide, dissocié de toute attache à la transcendance, privé même de tout contenu substantiel. Cette étude entend rappeler que la philosophie politique contemporaine ne s'est nullement accommodée de ce processus de déthéologisation : au cours des dernières décennies, son propre a bien été, en s'appuyant sur le constat des « déraillements » de la modernité, de vouloir reconstituer une forme de lien entre le politique et le religieux. Cette intention partagée s'est incarnée dans trois grandes architectures de sens. La première tient dans le paradigme du recouvrement : il s'agit ici, tout en adhérant le plus souvent aux institutions démo-libérales, de replacer le droit politique sous dépendance de la norme religieuse. La deuxième position s'agence, quant à elle, autour du paradigme de la substitution : on saisit le politique alors comme un objet d'investissement religieux. La troisième figure relève du paradigme de la délibération : attachée au principe d'indétermination démocratique, à distance donc de toute primauté du spirituel comme de toute religion du politique, elle se construit, quant à elle, autour du dessein d'articuler, dans l'espace de la discussion civique, les convictions séculières et les croyances religieuses. Dans son ordre propre, la philosophie politique confirme l'hypothèse de l'inscription de nos sociétés dans une forme de post-sécularité. Modernity has been often described via the idea of a secularization of the Political: by way of the hobsian "great separation", power would have become an empty space, dissociated from all attachment to transcendence, deprived even of all substantial content. This study whishes to remind that contemporary Political Philosophy hasn't accommodated with this process of de-theologization: along the last decades, what characterized it has been, f~<br>

Abstract: Afrikaans writers have often found themselves in a marginal position. During the time of apartheid, they vehemently criticised racial discrimination, thus dissociating themselves from the centre of power. After the demise of apartheid, Afrikaans writers were marginalised in a different way, when the Afrikaans language lost its previous dominant position and truly became a minority language. They were then forced to reexamine their past and reinterpret their present. In this article, recent Afrikaans writers' radical reinvention of the ideological significance of the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) is discussed. One novel about the War, Ingrid Winterbach's Niggie ("Cousin") is analysed in detail as an example of the search for meaning from a marginal position. The novel has a special relevance for Afrikaners in their painful adaptation to a new South Africa, but it is also linked to general themes like trauma, despair and hope.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>

Author(s): Springs Jason A.<br>
Abstract: Amid the debates over the meaning and usefulness of the word "culture" during the 1980s and 1990s, practice theory emerged as a framework for analysis and criticism in cultural anthropology. Although theorists have gradually begun to explore practice-oriented frameworks as promising vistas in cultural anthropology and the study of religion, these remain relatively recent developments that stand to be historically explicated and conceptually refined. This article assesses several ways that practice theory has been articulated by some of its chief expositors and critics, and places these developments in conversation with comparable accounts of "social practices" by recent pragmatist philosophers. My aim in generating such a conversation is to illuminate the ways that Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work provides important resources for cultural analysis that are already implicit in practice theory, yet either frequently overlooked or dismissed by practice theorists. I demonstrate how a Wittgensteinian understanding of practice theory coheres with, and illuminates, Clifford Geertz's account of meaning, thick description, and religious practices. Reading Geertz as a practice theorist, I argue, helps alleviate the apparent opposition between assessing meaning and analyzing power in the study of religious practices and institutions, and unsettles dichotomous accounts of belief and intentional action.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against the all too common dichotomy of globalization into a process of homogenization or a process of significant diversification. The paper seeks to bridge this dichotomy by arguing for the relative autonomy of culture with respect to global political-economy, for the plurality of voices that constitute ongoing social interaction, and for a vision of actors operating in fields of power that position human agents differentially. The essay makes use of world systems theory to illustrate the merits and problems of global analysis while focussing on the ethnographic examples of French and Michigan wine growers. /// L'article s'inscrit en faux contre la vision dichotomique et récurrente de la mondialisation selon laquelle il s'agit soit d'un processus d'homogénéisation, soit d'un profond processus de diversification. L'article cherche à surmonter cette dichotomie en soutenant l'existence d'une autonomie relative des cultures face à l'économie politique mondiale, d'une pluralité des voix qui constituent les interactions sociales en cours et d'une vision qui situe les acteurs au sein de cercles de pouvoir qui leur imposent des positions différentielles. L'essai se sert de la théorie des systèmes-monde pour illustrer le bien-fondé et les défauts des analyses de niveau mondial. Il met l'accent sur des exemples ethnographiques de viticulteurs de la France et du Michigan.<br>

Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Article Title: Language and the Making of Place: A Narrative-Descriptive Approach<br>
Publisher: Association of American Geographers<br>
Issue: i323950<br>

Author(s): Tuan Yi-Fu<br>
Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Author(s): Wittgenstein John L.<br>
Abstract: One of the most interesting potential contributions of culture research lies at the intersection of the study of culture and the study of power. At this intersection lies a process of communication in which interested actors present particular understandings of the world in the hope of creating or sustaining preferred patterns of social relations. In this processes, groups and individuals struggle to create and disseminate cultural forms that support preferred patterns of power and dominance. This article presents a methodology, critical hermeneutics, useful in analyzing these attempts. To underscore the usefulness of the approach, we applied the method to a corporation's image advertising campaign, a set of texts intended to restructure the corporation's image and reframe a set of issues in a way favorable to it.<br>

Abstract: Tras el fin del régimen del apartheid en Sudáfrica, la Comisión Verdad y Reconciliación, creada durante las negociaciones que llevaron al traspaso de poder, fue un instrumento decisivo para la transición pacífica a la democracia. Si esta forma negociada de compartir el poder entre enemigos acérrimos cogió por sorpresa al mundo exterior, este segundo proceso provocaría una sorpresa todavía mayor: la Comisión Verdad y Reconciliación fue un desenmascaramiento no judicial, no político y sin represalias de los perpetradores de la época del apartheid, y generó un proceso de amnistía sin precedentes. Este ensayo explica cómo funcionó dicho proceso y cómo se enmarcó en una nueva concepción de la justicia, arraigada en la confesión voluntaria por parte de los perpetradores y en una retórica reparadora de los relatos personales. Defiende que los perpetradores son, paradójicamente, el lugar antropológico donde asentar los cimientos de la democracia. After the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa, one fundamental instrument for a peaceful transition to democracy was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, agreed upon during the negotiations that lead to the handing over of power. In the same measure as such negotiated power sharing between bitter enemies took by surprise the outside world, this second process was to provoke an even greater surprise: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a non-judicial, non-political, non-retaliatory exposure of apartheid-era perpetrators, and created a unique process of amnesty. This essay explains how the amnesty process operated and how it was framed by a new conception of justice, rooted in voluntary disclosure by perpetrators and a restorative rhetoric of personal narratives. It argues that perpetrators are paradoxically the anthropological site for a democratic foundation.<br>

Abstract: Using the case study of an infamous murder scandal, this article uncovers some of the more complex relations and misleading perceptions about the Bolshevik and Musavat parties in Baku, Azerbaijan, during the Russian Revolution and civil war. It explores the power of rumour-making to configure and emplot their competing narratives of the revolution: informed either by the imperatives for social polarization and all-Russian socialism, or by the imperatives for class co-operation and Azerbaijani national socialism.<br>

Abstract: See Quentin Skinner, On Justice, The Common Good and Liberty', in Dimensions of
Radical Democracy: Pluralism, Citizenship, Community, ed. Chantai Mouffe (London,
1992). Skinner and Pocock have been especially influential of course in bringing the
republican tradition into greater focus over the last few years. Given the complicated
history of the relations between liberal and republican thought that they so well document,
it is nicely ironic that they seek to attack versions of modern liberalism with weapons taken
from a tradition so deeply, if ambiguously, implicated in its development. It is also worth
pointing out here, however, that 'republicanism' as such has also been 'revived' (if that is
quite the word) by some scholars who hardy share either the methodological or the
normative agenda's of the Cambridge school, to wit some of the friends and allies of Leo
Strauss, especially Harvey Mansfield and Thomas Pangle (see, for example, Mansfield's
Taming the Prince: The Ambivalence of Modern Executive Power (Baltimore, 1989) and
Pangle's The Spirit of Modern Republicanism (Chicago, 1988)). I do not propose to argue
the toss between the Cambridge school and Straussian versions of 'republicanism' here, I
merely point out that this is contested ground.<br>

Author(s): Hall Anne<br>
Abstract: The problem of how to access and deploy the explanatory power of culture in historical accounts has long remained vexing. A recent approach, combining and transcending the "culture as structure"/ "culture as practice" divide among social historians, puts explanatory focus on the recursivity of meaning, agency, and structure in historical transformation. This article argues that meaning construction is at the nexus of culture, social structure, and social action, and must be the explicit target of investigation into the cultural dimension of historical explanation. Through an empirical analysis of political alliance during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, I demonstrate that historians can uncover meaning construction by analyzing the symbolic structures and practices of narrative discourse.<br>

Abstract: Garifuna religion is derived from a confluence of Amerindian, African and European antecedents. For the Garifuna in Central America, the spatial focus of authentic religious practice has for over two centuries been that of their former homeland and site of ethnogenesis, the island of St Vincent. It is from St Vincent that the ancestors return, through spirit possession, to join with their living descendants in ritual events. During the last generation, about a third of the population migrated to the US, especially to New York City. This departure created a new diasporic horizon, as the Central American villages left behind now acquired their own aura of ancestral fidelity and religious power. Yet New-York-based Garifuna are now giving attention to the African components of their story of origin, to a degree that has not occurred in homeland villages of Honduras. This essay considers the notion of 'leaving' and 'joining' the African diaspora by examining religious components of Garifuna social formation on St Vincent, the deportation to Central America, and contemporary processes of Africanization being initiated in New York.<br>

Publisher: Society of Spanish and Spanish-American Studies<br>
Issue: i27741343<br>
Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Fajardo Salvador J.<br>
Abstract: The present essay examines the ideological implications of Luis Cernuda's "Ninfa y pastor por Ticiano." In the Poem Cernuda uses ekphrasis as a springboard for the exploration of creative desire, transforming Titian's painting into an erotic generator of creativity. The erotic center of the painting—the nymph's form—becomes a mirror in whose light are reflected and merged the speaker's, Titian's, and the reader's creative desires. Starting from a position of radical dissent, the poem critiques canonical visual values with respect to the viewing subject, moral values as expressed and represented by the Christian story of man/woman's creation, and, more widely, by producing a deviation of readerly desire, it critiques the traditional codes of control and power relations in which we are immersed.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>

Author(s): Clegg Stewart R.<br>
Abstract: Although studies in organizational storytelling have dealt extensively with the relationship between narrative, power and organizational change, little attention has been paid to the implications of this for ethics within organizations. This article addresses this by presenting an analysis of narrative and ethics as it relates to the practice of organizational downsizing. Drawing on Paul Ricoeur's theories of narrative and ethics, we analyze stories of organizational change reported by employees and managers in an organization that had undergone persistent downsizing. Our analysis maintains that the presence of a dominant story that seeks to legitimate organizational change also serves to normalize it, and that this, in turn, diminishes the capacity for organizations to scrutinize the ethics of their actions. We argue that when organizational change narratives become singularized through dominant forms of emplotment, ethical deliberation and responsibility in organizations are diminished. More generally, we contend that the narrative closure achieved by the presence of a dominant narrative amongst employees undergoing organizational change is antithetical to the openness required for ethical questioning.<br>

Abstract: Using an "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, this essay analyzes the speech made by Mussolini in the square in Carbonia, Sardinia, on 18 December 1938. The analysis also takes in other speeches and reveals the power of Mussolini's logos: this was not simply inaugural, ritual and foundational in its celebration of the new town, but recognised a historic turning point in the policies of the Italian nation and empire in the passage of the fascist state from ruralism to industrial urbanism. By broadening the study, the power of Mussolini's declarative strategy becomes more apparent. Also that other subjects were submerged with subversive micro-narrations of different types. Finally, multiple discourses, practices and complex negotiating subjects appeared in the post-fascist democracy. The "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, which is at first restricted, is later broadened and utilized on a speech-by-speech basis: from the comical and satirical to the poetic and the contractual. Highlighting the discursive conflicts at work, examples are emphasized of dialectical speeches that constitute and characterize other antagonists and protagonists of democratic cultural modernity: the nurse-comedy-writer, miner-poet, and miner-trade unionist. In the new fascism these figures test new risky declarations that were also practices of freedom, caring for oneself and many others, to the extent of spreading into democratic relations. These speeches and themes operate in a setting where discursive and identity-related powers meet, hidden and manifest, public and private, in the mine and the city.<br>

Author(s): White Sheldon H.<br>
Abstract: The rhetoric of social work often seeks its legitimacy and authority on the idea that knowledge can be translated into skills. Knowledge is made in universities in the form of timeless, objective, context-free truths about people and social institutions. Such knowledge rationalizes and justifies the professional practices of social work. It is not clear, however, that the knowledge-into-skills story fully explains social work practices. Practice is often ineffective and tends to throw social workers into moral quandaries, leaving them to practice in a context of faith and doubt. In addition to skills, social workers share values, purposes, the wielding of and submission to power, and mythic stories. Timely, value-expressive, contextual knowledge helps social work to create and maintain social solidarity and to shift its dispositions of skills, purposes, power, and myth to keep up with the pace of social change.<br>

Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Journal Title: Law & Society Review<br>
Article Title: Subversive Stories and Hegemonic Tales: Toward a Sociology of Narrative<br>
Publisher: Law and Society Association<br>
Issue: i354567<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Silbey Susan S.<br>
Abstract: The authors outline a sociology of narrative-an analysis of the role of narrative in various social contexts, including academic sociolegal scholarship. Narratives are social acts that depend for their production and cognition on norms of performance and content that specify when, what, how, and why stories are told. Because narratives are situationally produced and interpreted, they have no necessary political or epistemological valence but depend on the particular context and organization of their production for their political effect. The analysis specifies the variable conditions that produce hegemonic tales-stories that reproduce existing relations of power and inequity-and subversive stories-narratives that challenge the taken-for-granted hegemony by making visible and explicit the connections between particular lives and social organization.<br>

Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Abstract: The recent turbulent events in the Middle East indicate the importance and the challenges of uniting citizens in each of these countries in some commonly known story of who they are and from whence they have come. A consciously constructed sense of collective history is one especially fertile ground from which stories of national identity can be drawn. This article interprets a set of symbols displayed in a political drama in one particular Turkish small town. Following Ricoeur's analyses of ideology, it shows how sentiments of national identity are created and maintained in seemingly small ways. The symbols and processes which affirm identity, however, concomitantly disguise and distort other expressions of the historic situation. Although distortions may be the result of benign processes of signification, they may also be manipulated to favor the needs and desires of persons and groups which seek to maintain power and influence.<br>

Abstract: Desde hace una década, el concepto tradicional de "cultura" en antropología ha experimentado un nuevo auge tanto en las ciencias sociales como en el público en general. No obstante, en el discurso de la antropología, la teoría holística de la cultura fue abandonada desde hace mucho tiempo debido a problemas de variación entre las culturas, de poder, de cambio cultural y de acción individual. La parte principal del artículo formula un concepto de "cultura" como proceso inestable, abierto, de negociación del significado; si puede establecerse un consenso, dicho proceso conduce a una estabilización de los sistemas simbólicos y observamos los procesos correspondientes de una relación social cerrada al exterior [Weber]. La última parte analiza las repercusiones que dicho concepto de "cultura" (vinculado a una teoría del conflicto y del consenso) acarrea para el papel que tiene la antropología en el ámbito público y en el campo de las disciplinas científicas. /// Since a decade, a revival of the traditional anthropological concept of "culture" can be observed in the social sciences as well as in the larger public. In anthropological discourse, however, the holistic theory of culture has long been abandoned, because of the problems of intra-cultural variation, of power, of cultural change and individual action. The main part of the article develops an understanding of culture as an unstable, open process of negotiating meaning, which leads, if a consensus can be established, to a stabilization of symbolic systems and corresponding processes of social closure [Weber]. The concluding part discusses the implications that such a conflict-compromise oriented concept of "culture" has for the role of anthropology in the public sphere and in the field of scientific disciplines.<br>

Abstract: Concerns with how cultural factors influenced agrarian social change remained an abiding interest in the work of James Scott. I begin by sketching out the context of debates in Marxist theory, development studies, and social and political anthropology that, during the 1980s, turned to relations between ideas, power, and processes of conflict and change in a world of new postcolonial nations and rapid agrarian development. In the article, then, I carefully examine the ideas Scott developed about resistance and hegemony in conversation with the work of E. P. Thompson. Tracing the genealogy of Scott's ideas about hegemony and rural social protest, I comment in some detail on the literature on resistance that arose in anthropology during the 1980s and the role of Scott's "Weapons of the Weak" (1985) in shaping that literature while interacting with "Subaltern Studies" (Guha 1982-87), studies of social movements, and examinations of power in interpersonal relations.<br>

Abstract: Much international and intercultural discourse about historiography is influenced by a way of historical thinking deeply rooted in human historical consciousness and that works throughout all cultures and in all times: ethnocentrism. Ethnocentric history conceives of identity in terms of "master-narratives" that define togetherness and difference as essential for identity in a way that causes tension and struggle. These narratives conceive of history in terms of "clashes of civilizations," and they reinforce the idea that international and intercultural relations are merely struggles for power. The main elements of ethnocentrism are: asymmetrical evaluation, teleological continuity, and centralized perspective. This essay articulates possibilities for overcoming these three elements by replacing asymmetrical evaluation with normative equality; teleological continuity with reconstructive concepts of development that emphasize contingency and discontinuity; and centralized perspectives with multi-perspectivity and polycentric approaches to historical experience. Adopting these possibilities would lead to a new mode of universal history rooted in a concept of humankind that can help solve the problem of ethnocentrism. This idea of humankind conceptualizes the unity of the human species as being manifest in a variety of cultures and historical developments. This is in fact the traditional concept of historicism, which can be further developed towards a historiography that responds to the challenges of globalization and cultural differences. The essay outlines theoretical and methodological means in historical studies that bring this idea of humankind into the work of historians, thus enabling them to contribute to a new culture of recognition. The article is based on the assumption that the creation of such a culture is the most important task of scholarly work in the humanities in general, and historical studies in particular, at the beginning of the twenty-first centu~<br>

Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Abstract: Using life narrative interviews with Arab students with Israeli citizenship collected in 1997-98, I inquire into the processes and problems in talking about one's collective identity. In particular, I address how Arab students manage multiple identifications and the role of social relationships in shaping identity narratives. First, I argue that identity narratives do not voice a single point of view. Rather, identity narratives articulate multiple affiliations that, often, cohere in an uneasy fashion. Our identities are not incoherent, but such multiplicity provides the opportunity for talking about identity in novel ways. Second, I argue that social relationships are an integral part of identity stories that work to introduce, close off, balance, and rebalance possible self-identifications. In talking about identity, we narrativize our social relationships, and these narrated relationships are key points in the plotline of our identity stories. Drawing on this interpretation, I argue that social policies that equalize power relations and allow for the creation of social relationships based on mutual respect have the potential to shape identities that, without giving up valued affiliations, contain an acceptance of the other at their core.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a reconsideration of how similes and metaphors function in the literary reading process, and examines the effects of their respective logical and syntactic forms, their truth-functional status, their pragmatic force, their creative power in language, and their roles as part of a cumulative textual process. Through a close reading of Alfred Jarry's "Les Jours et les nuits," it tests aspects of the accounts of metaphor offered by Cooper, Davidson, Kittay, Lecercle, Le Guern, and Ricœur, and thereby questions our criteria for the classification of simile and metaphor.<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>

Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): FreudAbstract: Although the depiction of a Neanderthal people in "The Inheritors" by William Golding is based mainly on the author's imagination and is thus anthropologically untenable, the author's treatment of Oa the earth goddess, worshipped by this tribe, is of unique value and justly represents his key concept. The reciprocity between the symbolic system and the symbol-dissolving element, both inherent in Oa, is very significant regarding cultural, religious, and psychological aspects in relation to the human beings in this novel. This reciprocity helps in the rediscovery of human potentialities that might be repressed and buried under the power structure of a given society.<br>

Author(s): Chidester David<br>
Abstract: In "Primitive Culture" (1871), E. B. Tylor supported his theory of religion, animism, by referring to reports about "savage" dreams. Citing Henry Callaway's "Religious System of the Amazulu" (1868-1870), Tylor invoked the dreams of a Zulu diviner, a "professional seer" who becomes a "house of dreams," as a classic example of animism because "phantoms are continually coming to talk to him in his sleep." In the original account, however, these spirits were not coming "to talk" to the diviner. They were coming to kill him. By situating nineteenth-century Zulu dreams and visions in a colonial contact zone of transcultural relations and asymmetrical power relations, we find a hermeneutics of dreams dealing with indeterminacy, an energetics of dreams, linking dreams to ancestral ritual, which is radically disrupted, and a new interreligious space of resources and strategies for negotiaing and navigating within a violent world.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000937<br>
Date: 4 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This essay outlines a new preface for ethics demanded by the massive developments of the global age. It does so in and through the comparative use of "myths" to explicate the lived structure of experience. The essay begins by isolating main features of global dynamics, including proximity, the compression of the world and the expansion of consciousness, and also global, cultural reflexivity. In the second step of the "preface," it is argued that globality itself is a moral space in which peoples must orient their lives. It is a moral space defined by the massive extension of human power in the modern world. In light of the challenge that global dynamics and the extension of human power now pose, the essay then isolates, methodologically, options for developing a global ethics, and advocates a distinctly hermeneutical approach. This approach is practiced in the last section of the "preface" by engaging ethically the biblical "myth" of creation and its reinterpretation in an epitome of Jesus's Torah teaching. The intention is to show how current religious thought can speak to massive challenges in a distinctive way. It is, again, to offer a preface to ethics.<br>

Author(s): Hellweg Joseph<br>
Abstract: This article explores the hunting aesthetics of initiated Jula hunters of Côte d'Ivoire who call themselves dozos. It explains how their hunting aesthetic structures their relationship to Islam and the Ivoirian state. Although many Africans approach Islam in the context of tensions between local ritual traditions and modernizing Muslim reform, dozos approach Islam the way they approach the forests where they hunt, assimilating to both in order to tame them. They organize their hunting activities around an aesthetic centred on notions of sweetness and fullness; their contraries, difficulty and emptiness; and the process of mimetic transformation (shape-shifting) that mediates between these extremes. With these categories dozos assimilate themselves to and appropriate power from the forest to kill game. They also link themselves to pre-Qur'anic Muslim figures to legitimize themselves as Muslims. More recently, they tried to assimilate to the Ivoirian state to become a parallel police force. Stories of their tutelary spirit, Manimory, and the texts of their hunting songs, incantations, and epics encode diverse ways for dozos to relate to Islam, leaving room for dozos to eschew it as well. Their texts reveal a dynamic sense of history that defies classification in terms of tradition, modernity or postmodernity. /// Cet article examine l'esthétique de la chasse chez les chasseurs initiés julas de Côte d'Ivoire, qui se donnent le nom de dozos.

Author(s): Botelho Keith M.<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the depiction of murderous mothers in three early-seventeenth-century texts both contests and expands earlier notions of motherhood and female power by highlighting the effects of maternal memory. The pamphlet (1616) and broadside (1624) I examine both stress the disruptive potential of the forgetting of maternal duty, while the play, John Ford's Love's Sacrifice (1633), represents three mothers who remember their maternal duties through murder. All of these texts showcase a "new" mother construct where memory is the centerpiece, emphasizing the power of this ambiguous figure who can both create and destroy.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral.

Publisher: Society of American Archivists<br>
Issue: i40011862<br>
Date: 12 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Tussing Nicholas J.<br>
Abstract: In 1881, Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903) opened to scholarly research the Vatican Archives, a repository of documents recording papal history from the Middle Ages. Two years later, his letter Saepenumero considerantes, confirmed the opening and his motu proprio of May 1884 gave further instructions. The opening was entwined with both the broader world of Italian politics and the smaller political sphere of the archives itself. The "macropolitical" context was the ecclesiastical controversy about the papacy's role in Italian history, which informed Leo XIII's decision to expand access to the archives. The micropolitical context concerns the management of the archives and the politics of access inside the Vatican. In his memoirs published posthumously in 1947, Protestant scholar Theodor Sickel² shows how bureaucratic power struggles and disagreements on extending access affected a scholar interested in historical research for its own sake. Despite Leo XIII's appreciation for Sickel's work, some of the pope's subordinates tried to hinder access to the documents, a disjunction between papal policy and its implementation. In part, these obstructions reflected the difficulty of translating a general policy into concrete terms; but they also revealed a clash within the Curia. This conflict informs both Leo XIII's letter and Sickel's memoirs. Leo XIII's letter equates truth with apologetics, or the defense of the Catholic Church:³ for Leo XIII, the archives embodied the Church's memory and therefore its identity. Sickel's memoirs, on the other hand, illustrate the politics of archives management.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Abstract: The article explores the social meaning of the songs written and performed during the revolutionary Democratic Kampuchea period in Cambodia (1975-1979), hoping thereby to better understand the ideology of the Khmer Rouge as it relates to aesthetic and the degree to which such an aesthetic may be related to the abuses of power associated with the period. The article summarizes what is known about how the songs were generated and used: on radio broadcasts, at political meeting, and as part of revolutionary theater. It discusses the social implications of the ways the songs were used in meetings and at work sites, and the power generated by the fact that the songs were used to the exclusion of earlier kinds of songs. Finally, the article analyzes three songs found in Khmer Rouge song books, in terms of the attitudes expressed toward nature, labor, youth, and the relationship of the sexes. It explores the idea of irony, and how the "meaning" of the songs may have been tinged with greater and greater irony in relation to the changing reality of the Cambodian revolution.<br>

Abstract: O estudo visa apresentar os supostos teóricos e as tensões essenciais da tematização da ideia de Quinto Império na Defesa Perante o Tribunal do Santo Ofício, do P.e António Vieira. A visão profética de Vieira assume o contraste entre um tempo de inautenticidade na relação teândrica, subsidiário da Queda adâmica e objectivado na sucessão dos quatro impérios (cf. Daniel, 2, 27-45), e a novidade absoluta do acontecimento de Cristo, que se espera vir a manifestar-se na pacificação terrena do processo histórico e na constituição duma comunidade universal segundo o Espírito. A tese, que só um estudo ulterior poderá demonstrar, é a de que a perspectiva do Quinto Império, em Vieira, será, ainda subsidiária das categorias dominantes no tempo dos quatro impérios, em que a experiência escatológica se refracta antropocentricamente pelas finalidades, e relações de poder, político-civilizacionais. /// Cette étude presente les présupposés théoriques et les tensions essentielles de Ia thématisation de Tidée de Cinquième Empire dans Ia Défense Auprès du Tribunal du Saint-Office, du P.

Abstract: L'infini de la volonté voulante n'exclut pas la finitude de l'homme; il l'accentue plutôt dans la mesure où l'homme est incapable de saturer son désir et de s'achever par lui-même. Cette finitude apparaît comme disproportion ontologique dans l'écart du savoir, du pouvoir et du faire, comme faillite de la volonté voulue dans l'expérience de la faute meurtrière. L'ultime tentative de l'autosuffisance humaine consiste à borner le désir et à l'investir dans un fini absolutisé, comme en témoignage l'action superstitieuse. Dans le cas de l'option positive, qui est de "vouloir l'infini" , peut-on concevoir l'achèvement de l'action comme "divinisation" de l'homme? Oui, a condition de ne pas en faire un donné de nature, ni un acquis de l'homme, mais un accueil du don surnaturel qui exige l'aveu de l'insuffisance. /// O infinito da vontade profunda "voulante" não exclui a finitude do homem; antes a acentua na medida em que o homem é incapaz de saturar o seu desejo e de se completar por si mesmo. Esta finitude aparece como desproporção ontológica no distanciamento do saber, do poder e do fazer, como falência (faillite) da vontade concreta "voulue" na experiência da falta mortífera. A ùltima tentativa da autosuficiência humana consiste em limitar o desejo e em investir num finito absolutizado, como o testemunha a acção supersticiosa. No caso da opção positiva, que é de "querer o infinito", pode conceber-se o acabamento da acção como "divinizacao" do homem? Sim, se não se fizer disso urn dado da natureza, nem uma aquisição do homem, mas urn acolhimento do dom sobrenatural que exige a confissão da insuficiência. /// The infinity of the "willing will" ("volonté voulante") does not exclude man's finiteness. It rather stresses it, by the fact that man is unable to completely satisfy his desire, and to fulfil himself on his own. This finiteness appears as ontological disproportion far from both knowledge, power and acting, and as deficiency ("faillite") of the "willed will" ("volonté~<br>

Abstract: Par Undo do princípio de que a crítica feita em Wahrheit und Methode à Aufklärung tern sobretudo a ver com a hostilidade do iluminismo nos seus confrontos com o preconceito religioso enquanto fundado na revelação cristã, o presente artigo pretende demonstrar de que modo Gadamer, por exemplo já num ensaio de 1941 acerca da critica kantiana da religião, alcançou a partir da sua familiaridade de longa data com os Gregos e os seus deuses uma concepção do religioso que, ao fundar--se sobre a experiência "humanística" do Divino, aspira a manter uma solidariedade intima com a "Religion nach der Aufklärung" ("Religiao segundo a Auflärung"), cujo Deus, apcsar de ser o Deus dos filósofos, nem por isso é menos versado em revelaqçõs e em formas extra-potentes de realidade ". O artigo mostra ainda como no contexto de uma concepção como esta o Divino acabapor assumir sobretudo a figura da "amizade" e da "transcendencia do belo." /// It can be said that Gadamer's critique of the Aufklärung in Wahrheit und Methode has to do with the hostility of the Enlightenment towards religious prejudice derived from Christian revelation. This article aims to demonstrate that, already in an essay dating from 1941 about the Kantian critique of religion, Gadamer possessed a conception of God, largely due to his familiarity with the Greek notions of divinity, that sought nevertheless to maintain close ties with "Religion nach der Aufklärung". Whilst this God is the God of philosophers, it is a God inclined towards revelations and extra-ordinary expressions of power. In addition, the article shows that in this philosophical context the Divine acquires a figure suggesting "friendship" and a transcendent sense of the beautiful.<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies.

Abstract: A obra principal de Bernard Lonergan Inteligência: Um ensaio sobre o conhecimento humano, é um tratado que leva a cabo uma integração segundo o método transcendental dos conhecimentos heterogéneos da ciência, da filosofia, do senso comum e da teologia. A obra visa a auto-apropriação da nossa auto-consciência intelectual e racional com base na experiência consciente dos actos de intelecção. Começa como teoria cognitiva, expande-se para uma metafísica e uma ética, e avança para uma concepção e uma afirmação de Deus, para ser finalmente confrontada com o problema do mal que exige a transformação da inteligência auto-confiante no intellectus quaerens fidem. Ao cumprir estes objectivos, Inteligência tornou-se uma das mais importantes obras de filosofia do século XX, aqui sucintamente elucidada em cinco das suas principais vertentes: a relação entre conhecimento e realidade, conhecimento científico e cosmologia, a acção humana e a ética, as questões de interpretação, a relação entre natureza de Deus e filosofia. O artigo conclui com uma avaliação da cosmopolis lonerganiana, ou seja, o poder da comunidade de espírito na sociedade. /// Bernard Lonergan s opus magnum, Insight: A Study of human understanding, handles the heterogeneous fields of knowledge as given in science, philosophy, common sense and theology according to a transcendental method. The work aims at the self-appropriation of human intellectual and rational self-conscience as based in the conscious experience of insight. Lonergan s work starts as a cognitive theory, and advances, through metaphysics and ethics, to a conception and affirmation of God, one that is confronted with the problem of evil and therefore requires a transformation of self-confident intelligence into the intellectus quaerens fidem. Handling these goals, Insight became one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20 th century. The present article deals with five of the main issues in Lonergan s work: the relation between knowledge~<br>

Abstract: De part et d'autre de l'Atlantique, l'œuvre de Michel Foucault a été reçue de manière très différente par les anthropologues. Si l'anthropologie américaine a accueilli avec enthousiasme les réflexions du philosophe sur les rapports entre pouvoir et savoir, sur sa conceptualisations du biopolitique, les anthropologues français se sont montrés plus réticents et ont manifesté longtemps une certaine méfiance à l'égard de ce penseur. Chez Foucault luimême, on ne trouve que de rares références à l'anthropologie, et son point de vue sur l'anthropologie structurale est extrêmement critique. Cet article est centré sur la question du pouvoir, car c'est là que l'influence foucaldienne sur la nouvelle anthropologie est particulièrement manifeste, et il s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une interrogation plus large sur les rapports entre philosophie et anthropologie. /// On both sides of the Atlantic, anthropologists have received Michel Foucault's work quite differently. Whereas American anthropology has enthusiastically accepted the philosopher's thoughts about the relations between power and knowledge, and his conceptualization of "biopolitics", French anthropologists have, for a long time now, been more reluctant, even wary of this thinker. Foucault's work contains very few references to anthropology, and his point of view about structural anthropology was extremely critical. This article, which focuses on the question of power, where Foucault's influence on new trends in anthropology is especially evident, is part of a broader inquiry into the relations between philosophy and anthropology.<br>

Abstract: African American quiltmaking began to gain recognition as an expressive form distinct from European American quiltmaking in the countercultural climate of the 1970s. Representations of it since then have served to update the Eurocentric, patriotic image of quiltmaking in the United States with components ofmulticulturalism and cultural critique. These representations in turn caused tensions along the lines of class, race, gender, and scholarly discipline. This study shows the power of words and things when used together, as in museum exhibits, to affirm or challenge the existing social order.<br>

Author(s): Öncü Ahmet<br>
Abstract: Analysis of the Turkish state in the 20th century both draws upon and supports Gramsci's definition of the state as "dictatorship + hegemony." Both the form of the capitalist state and its activities rest upon the hegemony of the dominant class. The importance of society and class conflicts in understanding the capitalist state suggests a critical position vis-à-vis the state autonomy tradition. The history of the Turkish state provides support for the argument that the dominant class must have established hegemony in the state in the first place, since without this there is no guarantee of successful use of the coercive power of the state on behalf of the sectional interests of the dominant class.<br>

Abstract: La ciudad habla a sus habitantes. En este artículo se presenta a la ciudad como texto, susceptible de distintas lecturas. Este nivel significativo orienta los comportamientos urbanos, da cuenta de su trama social y contiene las huellas de las decisiones históricas que incidieron en su construcción. En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Publisher: El Colegio de México<br>
Issue: i40019126<br>
Date: 4 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Margulis Mario<br>
Abstract: En este artículo se rescata la tradición crítica del concepto "Ideologia". Se le intenta definir tratando de superar los problemas que emanan de su polisemia y de su utilización desde el sentido común. Para definirlo, el autor inicia su análisis a partir del apartado sobre fetichismo de la mercancía en el primer volumen de El Capital de Marx. Partiendo de los efectos del fetichismo sobre los procesos de pensamiento y los códigos de la cultura en un sistema productor de mercancías, se exponen los efectos sociales de la reificación (Lukács y Goldmann) y los rasgos principales de los contenidos ideológicos presentes en los discursos. El autor considera que las luchas sociales por el poder y la dominación son paralelos con las pugnas por la construcción social del sentido. En esa línea, llega a definir ideologia como "las huellas dejadas por las luchas por la hegemonía en los códigos de la cultura". /// The critical tradition attending the concept of'ideology' is recovered by defining this term in a way to avoid the traps set by its many meanings and its common sense usage. The author grounds his analysis on the arguments about the fetishism of commodities in the first volume of Marx's Capital. Taking as his starting point the effects of fetishism on the processes of thought and cultural codes in a commodity-producing system, he explains the social effects of reification (Lukacs and Goldmann), and the main characteristics of ideological contents in discourses. The author considers that social struggles over power and domination run parallel to competing social constructions of meaning. He defines ideology as "the tracks left by the fights over hegemony in the codes of culture".<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: L'auteur tente dans ce texte d'éclaircir certains aspects de l'imaginaire en relation avec l'Etat, la politique, mais aussi avec la violence et le mal, dans un contexte où la dialectique de l'identité et de l'altérité reste l'une des structures de l'imaginaire. L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles.

Issue: i40028140<br>

Author(s): Gildea Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is the text of an inaugural lecture given as Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford on 7 November 2008. It arises from a research project entitled Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories', which involves a team of historians examining samples of activist networks in fourteen European countries, in order to understand ways of becoming an activist, being an activist and making sense of activism. The key terms of this project are transnationalism – tracing resonances and interactions between activists and activist networks across frontiers – and subjectivity – using oral testimony to understand the phenomenon of activism. The framing and presentation of the project incited a rethink of the methods of oral history, not least because the project originated in Oxford, where scepticism persists about the credibility of oral history as a discipline. To persuade this audience of the power of oral history, the approach was taken to locate it at the confluence of three recent developments which have impacted on the study of history as a whole: the linguistic turn, memory studies, and interest in subjectivity, intersubjectivity and the unconscious. These reflections are then used to illuminate evidence drawn from French activists interviewed in the course of 2007 and 2008.<br>

Abstract: L'article examine les conceptions de Foucault concernant l'histoire de la vérité, ainsi que les rapports entre la volonté de savoir, la volonté de vérité et les formes du pouvoir. Il rappelle comment les notions nietzschéennes de volonté de vérité et de volonté de puissance font place dans son oeuvre à la volonté de savoir comme instrument des rapports de domination. On examine ensuite comment la notion d'autorité, entendue à la fois au sens institutionnel et au sens discursif, peut permettre une sociologisation des approches traditionnelles de la vérité, élaborées par les philosophes. Comment la visée de vérité du discours s'est-elle combinée historiquement avec la volonté de savoir des institutions ? Y a-t-il différents régimes de vérité, liés à des modalités de discours différentes, mais aussi à des formes d'autorité institutionnelle ? Est-il possible de construire une généalogie des figures de l'autorité discursive ? The paper examines Foucaultian views about the history of truth, as well as the relationships between the will to truth and the different forms of power. It reminds how Nietzsche's conceptions about the will to truth and the will to power are replaced in Foucault's work by the will to truth as a means of power relationships. The paper looks furthermore at the possibility of using the notion of authority, understood both in the institutional and in the discursive sense, as a tool for a sociologization of traditional approaches to truth, constructed by philosophers. How did the pursuit of truth historically combine with the will to knowledge belonging to the institutions ? Are there different regimes of truth, tied to different discursive modalities, as well as to institutional forms of authority ? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of figures of discursive authority ?<br>

Date: 6 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Martuccelli Danilo<br>
Abstract: En partant de quelques transformations sodétales majeures, et en s'appuyant sur la fiction romanesque française, l'article dessine deux grandes constellations imaginaires de la mobilité dans la modernité. La première associe le but du déplacement, l'existence d'un ailleurs, le goût de l'aventure, l'attitude de départ actif et le rôle de la mobilité comme logique de pouvoir. La deuxième, souvent en résonance avec les items précédents, souligne plutôt l'exigence de la mobilité pour la mobilité, la fin de l'idée de dehors, l'impératif de la fuite, la prolifération de l'expérience du départ passif, enfin, la centralité croissante de la mobilité dans le saisissement de la domination. Au terme de ce parcours, l'imaginaire de la mobilité apparaît comme une boussole privilégiée pour cerner les transformations de la modernité. The article tracks two major imaginary constellations of modem mobility, through the analysis of important social transformations, illustrated by certain French novels. The first joins the goal of mobility, the existence of an « elsewhere » , the taste for adventure, an active departure, and the role of mobility as a logic of power. The second, frequently in relationship with the precedent, emphasizes the idea of mobility for itself, the end of elsewhere Utopia, the need to run away, the multiplication of experiences of passive departure, and finally the growing link between mobility and domination. The mobility imaginary appears at last as a privileged compass to surround the transformations of modernity.<br>

Abstract: The critical discourse on U.S. military detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison has been dominated by Weberian-style arguments (a bureaucracy gone wrong, insufficient or badly applied administrative rules, or individuals acting as cogs in a machine). We argue that Michel Foucault's "security apparatus" provides a more insightful model for understanding the Abu Ghraib phenomenon. According to this model, the prison becomes a nodal point in an information-gathering nexus confronting unforeseen, emergent, and unclear events, a place where power is less disciplinary than improvisational, exercised through practical judgments about uncertain situations. The performance of such power at Abu Ghraib included the use of photography and acts that, we claim, resemble M. M. Bahktin's negative carnivalesque.<br>

Abstract: Sowohl Ethnologie wie Soziologie werden durch die Globalisierung herausgefordert. Die vermeintlich abgeschlossenen fremden „Völker“ verschwinden; „Gesellschaft“ nationalstaatlich zu konzipieren, wird immer unplausibler. Eine (Wieder) Annäherung der beiden im neunzehnten Jahrhundert ausdifferenzierten Fächer tut Not. Taugt „Kultur“ dafür als Brückenbegriff? Soziologen wie Andreas Reckwitz werben für eine praxis-oder diskurstheoretische Reformulierung des Kulturkonzepts, tragen dabei aber auch zu einer problematischen, weil zu umfassenden „Kulturalisierung“ des Sozialen bei. Dagegen halten Ethnologen wie Adam Kuper oder Chris Hann den Kulturbegriff für so unrettbar reifiziert, diffus und machtblind, dass sie ihn lieber abschaffen oder doch umfassend „soziologisieren“ und durch eine präzisere Benennung der jeweils gemeinten symbolischen Codes oder sozialen Praktiken ersetzen wollen. Der vorliegende Artikel schließt sich eher den Skeptikern an und zeichnet aus dieser Perspektive die wichtigsten Stationen der „Entsoziologisierung“ des klassischen ethnologischen Kulturbegriffs und die neuere Kritik in der Ethnologie sowie Ansätze nach, Kultur als Arena von machtförmigen Aushandlungsprozessen zu begreifen. Anthropology and sociology are both challenged by globalisation. Supposedly self-sustaining peoples are rapidly disappearing, and attempts to conceptualize "society" within the parameters of the nation-state have proven themselves unfeasible. It is time to (re) consider the two disciplines that both took shape in the nineteenth century. Can 'culture' still serve as a bridge concept? Sociologists like Andreas Reckwitz have argued in favour of a discourse-and practise-oriented conception of culture, one, however, that entails difficulties of its own, as it leads to the complete culturalization of the social. Anthropologists such as Adam Kuper or Chris Hann, on the other hand, believe the concept of culture to be so reified, diffuse and blind to power relations that they wo~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: Nombreux sont les versets coraniques qui insistent sur la toute-puissance de Dieu : en maître absolu du Bien et du Mal, il fait ce que bon lui semble, égarant et sauvant qui II veut. Pris au pied de la lettre, ces versets ont inspiré une vision déterministe et fataliste dé l'homme et du monde qui exclut toute possibilité de fonder une éthique rationnelle : le bien et le mal sont entièrement déterminés par la seule volonté de Dieu et l'islam se résume alors à une soumission aveugle aux décrets divins. Tenue pour responsable de l'ankylose de la pensée musulmane, voire des dérives obscurantistes de l'islamisme radical, cette position, qui résulte du triomphe de l'as'arisme dans le sunnisme postclassique, est de nos jours sévèrement critiquée par des théologiens soucieux de promouvoir un islam éclairé. Ceux-ci renouent souvent avec des doctrines mu'tazilites visant à atténuer, d'une façon ou d'une autre, la puissance divine et à reconnaître en Dieu une certaine « impuissance », afin de créer un espace pour l'homme. L'article retrace l'historique de ce débat, qui remonte aux origines mêmes de la théologie musulmane. Many verses in the Koran insist on God's omnipotence: as the absolute Master of Good and Evil, He does whatever he likes, condemning or saving whomever He decides. Understood literally, those verses have inspired a deterministic and fatalistic vision of man and the world, one which excludes any possibility of grounding a rational ethics. Both Good and Evil are totally determined by the will of God alone, and Islam may be summed up as a blind submission to divine decrees. This position, which results from the triumph of as'arism in post-classical sunnism, has been held responsible for the stagnation of Muslim thought, indeed for the obscurantist excesses of radical Islamism and is today severely criticized by some theologians concerned to promote an enlightened Islam. These scholars have often revived mu'tazilist doctrines whose aim is to weaken one way or ano~<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40050915<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Rosin Christopher<br>
Abstract: Audit schemes dictating the parameters of environmentally and socially acceptable management practice have emerged as a pervasive feature of global agri-food production. While the impacts of such schemes on the global movement of food and fibre and the evolving terrains of power in agri-food relations are well documented, the associated reconstruction of farming identities in the localities where audits are implemented has received less attention. The emerging responses to audit schemes in the New Zealand kiwifruit and dairy sectors are key examples of the contentious nature through which auditing is incorporated within farming practice. Analysis of these responses reveals the potential for audits to alter the spirit of farming in New Zealand, initiating new conventions of interaction between producers and industries. Within a convention theory framework, the incorporation of auditing within standard management practice involves a negotiated process in which the farmers employ strategic justifications of their capability (and value) relative to the quality designations established by the audit. Rather than evaluate the relative merits of a farm, its product and its owner through the craft and skill of the independent land manager, successful farming is increasingly associated with the individual's ability to conform to an audit's structures. The global trend toward audit schemes suggests that similar challenges to the spirit of farming may be replicated in other contexts.<br>

Author(s): Reichardt Ulfried<br>
Abstract: Taking issue with a prevalent tendency in literary criticism that reduces fictional texts to what is construed as an inevitable and constitutive complicity with the discourse of power, this essay investigates the ways in which William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! criticizes and affirms slavery and "racial" difference simultaneously by doubling the perspective on discursive structures through narrative and rhetorical strategies. The central argument is that time is one of the crucial factors through which not only the history of slavery, but also representations of relations between Self and Other are constructed. Drawing on hermeneutic thought, the concept of alterity is discussed on two levels, historical and cultural, as well as applied practically to a reading of the encounter between Miss Rosa and Clytie. Temporal distancing is shown to be used as a device through which white characters exclude African Americans, a mechanism, nevertheless, that reaches back to them with a recursive and retroactive effect. Faulkner's novel stages the ways in which white Southerners are affected by the ideology of "racial" difference.<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i383167<br>
Date: 4 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Wiley Douglas<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Date: 2 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks to outline and evaluate Pierre Bourdieu's work as it has appeared most recently in feminist studies and the field of gender and education. In particular, it suggests ways in which Bourdieu's theoretical insights could be seen to more effectively contribute to cutting edge debates in both social theory and feminist thought regarding concepts such as agency, identity and domination. It also argues that a more creative and empirical engagement with the recent work of Bourdieu, alongside an interdisciplinary reading of more recent cultural and social theories of power, would be a fruitful way forward in advancing a feminist sociology of education. In the present historical moment and against the tide of postmodern and post-structuralist feminist accounts, Bourdieu is often read as a determinist who has little to offer contemporary feminist debates or who argues that masculine domination is too tightly woven to social practices of a given field. In short, this paper argues that such a view is not only a misreading of Bourdieu's work on fundamental theoretical grounds, but fails to acknowledge the ways in which his more recent work on masculinity addresses both the cultural and social conditions underlying contemporary forms of symbolic domination. In short, the paper argues that Bourdieu's theory offers an analytical breadth and range beyond the scope of anything that a normative, liberal account of masculine domination could provide. Yet, in drawing from such diversity, Bourdieu's oeuvre is able to resist incomprehensibility. It stands as a highly focused, realistic and generative attempt (McNay, 1999; McLeod, 2004) to chart the problems of subordination, differentiation and hierarchy, and to expose the possibilities, as well as the limits, of gendered self-hood.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I uncover the routine, ongoing practices that sustain institutional multiplicity. Drawing on a comparative study of the two high-tech conferences held in Israel in 2002,1 examine how diverse institutions are discursively handled in field-configuring events. Institutional multiplicity was expressed at this site through two identity discourses, one that situated the industry within a national context and another that oriented it toward the global markets. In addition, the conferences were constructed around different best-practice discourses that focused on guidelines for either investment or management. These four discourses reflected and further affected power relations between the field's actors, and they were differentially distributed across separate social spaces between the conferences and within them. The contribution of this study to our understanding of institutional multiplicity lies in demonstrating how it is maintained in practice, politically negotiated between actors, and refracted across separate social spaces.<br>

Author(s): Zablocki Charles F.<br>
Abstract: This article is about the influence of the work of the German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) on English-speaking anthropologists. Although Weber does not figure prominently in the history of anthropology, his work has, nonetheless, had a profound influence on anthropological methodology and theoretical thinking on the relationship between religion and political economy. The "interpretive anthropology" first developed by Geertz has roots in Weber's "interpretive sociology." Bourdieu's "theory of practice" is also strongly Weberian in character. The anthropological study of religion, and particularly the debate over the foundations of this field between Geertz and Asad, is reconsidered in light of Weber's sociology of religion. His comparative study of the ethics of the world's religions and particularly the "Weber thesis" about the relationship between religion and the development of bourgeois capitalism are shown to have been the foundation for a large body of anthropological research on religion and political economy in societies in which the major world religions have been long established. The essay ends with a suggestion that Weber's work on politics and meaning merits reexamination in light of contemporary anthropological interest, derived from Foucault, in power and knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Internet suscite beaucoup d'espoirs et de craintes. Certains prétendent que cet outil sera favorable à l'émergence de sociétés de la connaissance à condition de réduire préalablement la fracture numérique et cognitive. Cet article prend prétexte de cette idée pour évaluer quels sont les réels rapports de force qui se jouent entre croyances et connaissances sur la toile. Il montre, d'une part, que l'amplification de la diffusion de l'information est favorable à l'expression du biais de confirmation qui est un des mécanismes fondamentaux de la pérennité des croyances. Il souligne, d'autre part, qu'Internet est un marché cognitif très sensible à la structuration de l'offre et donc à la motivation des offreurs, ce qui confère un avantage décisif à l'empire des croyances contre celui de la connaissance. Ce dernier point est mesuré dans cet article de façon quantitative sur des thèmes de croyances diverses. The Internet is the source of many hopes and fears. Some claim that this tool will help lead to the emergence of knowledge societies if digital and cognitive gaps can be reduced beforehand. This article takes that idea as a basis to then evaluate what are the real power relations played out between beliefs and knowledge on the web. It shows that the amplification of the dissemination of information is conducive to the expression of "confirmation bias" which is one of the mechanisms which permit beliefs to survive. It also stresses that Internet is a cognitive market which is very sensitive to structuring of supply and therefore the motivation of suppliers, which confers a decisive advantage to the "empire of beliefs". This last point is measured quantitatively in this paper on various topics of belief.<br>

Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i387752<br>

Author(s): Zukin Fred<br>
Abstract: To understand the rise of market fundamentalism from the margins of influence to mainstream hegemony, we compare the U.S. 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act and the English 1834 New Poor Law-two episodes in which existing welfare regimes were overturned by market-driven ones. Despite dramatic differences across the cases, both outcomes were mobilized by "the perversity thesis "-a public discourse that reassigned blame for the poor's condition from "poverty to perversity." We use the term "ideational embeddedness" to characterize the power of such ideas to shape, structure, and change market regimes. The success of the perversity thesis is based on the foundations of social naturalism, theoretical realism, and the conversion narrative. In the poverty to perversity conversion narrative, structural blame for poverty is discredited as empiricist appearance while the real problem is attributed to the corrosive effects of welfare's perverse incentives on poor people themselves-they become sexually promiscuous, thrust aside personal responsibility, and develop long-term dependency. This claim enables market fundamentalism to delegitimate existing ideational regimes, to survive disconfirming data, and to change the terms of debate from social problems to the timeless forces of nature and biology. Coupling economic sociology with a sociology of ideas, we argue that ideas count; but not all ideas are created equal. Only some have the capacity to fuel radical transformations in the ideational embeddedness of markets.<br>

Abstract: Looking at the trajectories of people of Muslim origin in Egypt who express religious doubts, I argue in this article that doubt and nonreligiosity are not necessarily a child of a Christian genealogy of the secular and definitely not alien to Muslims. Instead, we have to understand them as an intimate moral discontent with the contemporary age of Islamic revival, even if their shape and some of their positive claims are borrowed from notions of Western origin and global currency—most notably, human rights and feminism. There are reasons and ways to become a nonbeliever in a society profoundly affected by a religious revival, and these reasons and ways can be telling about the nature of doubt and certainty in general. They also offer a perspective on the problematic of secularism that focuses on issues of belief and existential trust rather than governmentality and discursive power.<br>

Abstract: This paper reviews a body of data that identifies underlying influences that have contributed to an evolving change in American Psychiatry toward a more positive and receptive stance toward religion and spirituality over the past three decades. This development, surprising in light of the remedicalization of psychiatry and its predominantly neuro-biological orientation, is attributed to five foundational ideas that have helped to leverage this change. These are significance of culture, creative power of ritual, psychic function of belief, neuro-biology of spirituality, and relevance of recovery narratives. The impact of these factors for psychiatric assessment and treatment is described, as well as the contribution of the Oskar Pfister legacy and award to the ongoing dialogue between religion and psychiatry. Adapted from the American Psychiatric Association's 2011 Oskar Pfister Lecture in Religion and Psychiatry.<br>

Abstract: John Blacking's suggestion that some music transcends its social function by creating worlds of virtual time opens the way to a deeper understanding of the ontology of music. For Blacking, "music that is for being" enhances human consciousness by heightening temporal experiences. Music's power to affect our consciousness of time stands at the heart of an ontology of music. By examining music s relation to limit experiences such as trance and ecstasy, in which time itself appears to be transcended, I intend to argue that music's mode of being is the ground of its social, cultural, and even spiritual efficacy.<br>

Author(s): Thévenot Laurent<br>
Abstract: Reconsidering previous exchanges between the économie des conventions (EC) and historical research, the article puts right different prejudices against EC and shows grounds for going deeper into cooperation. The first part is dedicated to the genesis and dynamics of conventions, in an open perspective on the ways value is placed on forms coordinating with others, the environment and oneself. Rather than looking for abstracts values, the article suggests to find the basis for repertoires of evaluation in empowering dependencies between human beings and their environment. This approach is favorable to a dialogue with historians on the domain of work identity, occupations and products or services. The second part deals with the politics of convention in a long-term perspective on power, authority and protest. Considering powers issuing from coordinative forms, it is claimed that this view helps to situate in a comparative and historical perspective nation-states among a variety of authorities which govern - possibly transnationally - through reduced conventions.<br>

Publisher: Tsehai Publishers<br>

Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a critical reappraisal of Abba Bahrey's Zenahu leGalla, the controversial 16th century text. Some scholars criticize it as harbouring anti-Oromo sentiments while others praise it as an important source on the organization of Oromo society The paper argues that, while Zenahu leGalla does provide useful historical information on the Oromo, its lasting value lies elsewhere: in the critical reflection it initiates on the issues of power, freedom, social change, violence, and the public use of reason. To unpack these issues, occluded by current interpretations of Zenahu leGalla, the paper undertakes a critical hermeneutical reading of the text. The reading shows that Bahrey's text incubates emancipatory surplus meanings that transcend his epoch and speak to the concerns of contemporary Ethiopia. In the concluding sections, the paper discusses the issues of democracy and development in light of these surplus meanings.<br>

Abstract: The paper proposes a symptomatic reading of the writings of a fifteenth century heretical movement—the Dekike Estifanos—to throw light on the modernization predicament of twenty–first century Ethiopia. Based on the assumption that all serious thinking about a society needs to be mediated by its intellectual tradition, the paper enucleates critiques of power, institutions and knowledge that are immanent in the teachings of the Dekike Estifanos and that throw a new light on how Ethiopians could approach the tasks they face in the twenty-first century. It shows that such a critical dialogue with Ethiopia's intellectual traditions discloses questions, ideas and ideals that could provide historically-rooted intellectual resources for developing an Ethiopian critical theory capable of illuminating the possible routes to a modernization productive of freedom, equality, justice, and prosperity.<br>

Abstract: The essay refers to a concern for social justice in the origins of public health, borne in part by religious commitments, and to more recent expressions of a similar concern in debates about health equity. Equity, moreover, is affected by discursive power relations (dominant/hegemonic versus local/suppressed), which are discussed in relation to current research in the African Religious Health Assets Programme on the interaction of particular 'healthworlds' (a conceptual innovation) that shape the choices and behaviour of health-seekers. Two background theoretical positions guide the argument: Amartya Sen's claim that development is linked to freedom (including religious freedom); and, building on Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's human capabilities theory, an asset-based community approach to the building or reconstruction of public health systems. On this basis, it is argued that health systems and health interventions are just to the extent that they mediate between the necessary leadership or polity from 'above' (techné) and the experience and wisdom (métis) of those who are 'below', taking into account the asymmetries of power that this equation represents. Because difference and diversity are so often expressed in what we might reasonably call 'religious' terms, I specifically emphasize the continuing persistence of religion and, hence, the importance of accounting for its pertinence in social theory generally, and in relation to discourses of health and justice in the African context specifically. Acknowledging the ambiguities of religion, I nevertheless argue that an appreciative alignment between public health systems and religious or faith-based initiatives in health promotion, prevention and care is crucial to sustainable and just health systems in Africa.<br>

Abstract: Enquadrar de um modo filosófico, educacional e político a questão do "Testamento Vital" (ou "Diretivas Antecipadas de Tratamento") pressupõe não haver dúvidas sobre o seu conteúdo. Por isso, este artigo pretende, numa primeira parte, e atendendo às dúvidas existentes em Portugal, explicitar de que falamos quando falamos de "Testamento Vital". Só então seräo abordadas temáticas mais complexas que nos alertam para o facto de o "Testamento Vital" não ser um mero instrumento de regulação de vontades em relação ao fim de vida, mas remeter para economías específicas de verdade, valor e poder que pressupõem respostas distintas a perguntas fundamentais que o ser humano faz sobre si próprio: a sua suposta "natureza", a liberdade ou não de determinar o seu destino, o significado da tolerãncia ou o que é fazer e respeitar o "bem" dos outros. Finalmente, um último ponto tratará de uma problemática muito específica dentro do questionamento geral em torno do "Testamento Vital", que é a da autonomia prospetiva, pois esse "Testamento" visa determinar agora o que pretendemos que nos façam no futuro em termos de cuidados de saúde, caso estejamos na altura incapazes de decidir. Este último ponto será elaborado com base em reflexōes de Ronald Dworkin. In order to frame in a philosophical, educational and political way the issue of the living wilb (or Advance Directives of Treatment) we should assume that there are no doubts about their meaning. As this is not the case in Portugal, the first part of this article will address this question. Only then will we be confronted with more complex subjects, in order to develop the idea that living wilh are not just a mere instrument that regulate end-of-life issues, but involve specific economies of truth, value and power that imply different answers to fundamental questions that human beings put to themselves: their supposed "nature", their freedom to determine or not their destiny, the meaning of tolerance or what it means to do and to respect~<br>

Abstract: Pour tous les jacobins, la souveraineté du peuple définit la citoyenneté. Le groupe girondin tient à son propos un discours minimaliste (la formation de l'opinion publique est la première étape de l'exercice de la souveraineté). Les cordeliers et les jacobins radicaux tiennent un discours maximaliste (le peuple fait la loi et juge la conformité de la loi avec le droit naturel). On note une inflexion marseillaise de ces discours. Les patriotes modérés y évoquent « la souveraineté relative et pour ainsi dire locale ». Les patriotes radicaux évoquent à partir du printemps 1793 une insurrection marseillaise prenant le relais de Paris comme moteur de la Révolution, et après le succès de cette insurrection, une organisation du pouvoir exécutif caractérisée par la multiplication des instances intermédiaires. Maignet, représentant en mission dans les Bouches-du-Rhône, tente une synthèse : le partage des fonctions (la Convention fait la loi, les départements s'occupent des problèmes locaux, les districts surveillent l'application des lois, les municipalités et les comités révolutionnaires s'occupent de tout ce qui est relatif aux personnes). For all Jacobins, citizenship was defined by the sovereignty of the people. The Girondin faction stuck to a minimalist discourse whereby the formation of public opinion is the first step in the exercise of sovereignty. The maximalist discourse of the Corde liers and the radical Jacobins held that the people make the law and judge the conformity between the law and natural right. One notes a marseillaise inflexion in this discourse. At Marseille, the moderate patriots evoked "the relative and local sovereignty, so to speak". From spring 1793 the radical patriots evoked a marseillaise insurrection taking its lead from Paris as motor of the Revolution and, after the success of the insurrection, and organization of the executive power characterized by the multiplication of intermediary governmental bodies.

Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The article discusses the presence of emancipatory Utopian ideas in Ethiopian history through a critical hermeneutical interpretation of Lalibela. Drawing on the concept of concrete utopia, the paper argues that the works and Chronicles of Lalibela secrete a concrete Utopian surplus that points to the conceptualization of knowledge as critique and as die mastery of nature, of labor as a transformative and emancipatory acüvity, and of power relations as expressions of equality between subjects and ruler. The article contends that Lalibelas Utopian surplus implies questions and reflections about social transformation, which, being rooted in Ethiopian history, provide possibilities for developing emancipatory ideas and practices that respond to the modern needs and aspirations of Ethiopians. It argues that, if Ethiopia u to extricate herself from the poverty and tyranny traps of passive modernization and successfully meet the challenges of modernity, reflection on and the quest for democracy and prosperity need to link up with the concrete Utopian surpluses that inform Ethiopian history.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Hatch John B.<br>
Abstract: The book Letters Across the Divide: Two Friends Explore Racism, Friendship, and Faith embodies a dialogic rhetoric with significant potential to influence its intended audience to accept the need for racial atonement and reconciliation. It exemplifies what Aaron Gresson calls a "dance of agency" in both its interpersonal exchanges and constructed relationship with readers. Bringing white and black voices, individual and collective concerns, and (interpersonal and public discourse into dialogue, Letters demonstrates the transformative power of "voice," which mediates the "authenticity" of Buberian dialogic rhetoric and the cultural performances of Bakhtinian dialogism. The fact that the white coauthor boldly affirms commonplaces of white resistance increases the likelihood that white readers would identify with and be influenced by his profound attitudinal change in dialogue with his black friend. The coherence and credibility ofthat transformation depend upon the prefigurai power of the authors' shared religious narrative—both enabling and constraining Letters' influence on public racial reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: In the context of globalization, cultural anthropology gained a new momentum by highlighting the self-conscious persistence of cultural differences. Against the background of an ever increasing intensity of societal and economic entanglements, the vital claim of cultural differences must be a reflexive process associated with the idea that one's own culture is creative and adaptive to innovations. Anthropologists have defined a set of tools in order to describe these processes of cultural changes. These tools have the names of hybridization, creolization and domestication, but, in particular also of cultural appropriation. Historically cultural appropriation was mainly relevant in contexts of unequal power relations. Appropriation thereby became a strategy of the powerless, who used appropriation in order to undermine the structures defined by the powerful. Cultural appropriation can also be practised through mimesis, and thereby negates the authority of powerful actors. Cultural appropriation requires moments of negotiations and does not aim at definitive results, but merely at the transgression of boundaries. Well defined fields of cultural appropriation within anthropology are media studies and consumption. Empirical approaches to a more detailed documentation of appropriation can be the following: (1) Naming, (2) Contextualization, (3) Incorporation and (4) material transformation.<br>

Abstract: Norbert Elias never presented his views regarding collective memory in a systematic manner. However, his approach may be reconstructed on the basis of such works as The Civilizing Process, Time: An Essay and The Symbol Theory. The most important tenet of Elias is that human memory can only be explained by the symbol theory. Human ability to use socially created symbols in communication is applied in activities in which symbols are used (speaking, thinking, knowing and remembering), which makes memory a part of general process of symbolic communication. Memory research needs to account for the interactive and communicational origins of both individual and collective remembering. One of the crucial issues related to remembering is collective forgetting. According to Elias it operates by three main mechanisms: (1) elimination and creation of fantastic notions (fantasy being a substitute and subsidiary for experience), (2) modification of social canons of reference as a result of power struggle in social figurations, and (3) delegitimization of alternative imageries by means of marginalization or elimination of groups acting as their social vehicles. I discuss these mechanisms and the dynamics of memory they entail in the broader conceptual framework of the theory of civilizing processes referring to Central and Eastern European examples in order to demonstrate the productivity of Elias's interdisciplinary and multidimensional analysis in social memory studies focusing this region.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to foster the regeneration and reorientation of peace research in the United States through its internationalization and radicalization. The authors locate the possible sources of this 'post-modern' redirection of American peace studies in the traditions of critical theory and phenomenology and in convergent work by contemporary West European scholars in Scandinavia and the Federal Republic of Germany. The main lines of this reorientation for American peace research are limned through an exploration of three substantive themes: power, violence, and hegemony; international society as totality; and the critical peace researcher as knower and actor.<br>

Author(s): TUPAS T. RUANNI F.<br>
Abstract: This article explores the nature of historical forgetting in the Philippines through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu's notion of forgetting as misrecognition, which is invested with power and struggle. The notion is concretized in the context of Reynaldo Ileto's discussion of the Schurman Commission, which was tasked to gather information about the Philippines as part of the United States' pacification campaign. Because historical forgetting is rooted in the structure of society itself, policies concerning language and education are imbued with power and class dimensions. The necessity of change in consciousness is enmeshed in the broader politics of social change, which is thus the context of the debate on the critical role of English in the Philippines. The political imperative to forget is inherent in—and partly sustains—the fundamental structure of social relations in the Philippines.<br>

Abstract: This article inquires into the social memory of Ferdinand Marcos and of his dictatorship in the literature written in the Language of his home region, the Ilocos, in the period since his downfall in the 1986 People Power Revolution. The novels Saksi ti Kaunggan (1986-1987) by Juan S. P. Hidalgo Jr. and Dagiti Bin-i ti Kimat (1995) by Clesencio B. Rambaud are used as indicators of changing narrative social memories of Marcos in llokano literature. Hidalgo's novel exemplifies the llokano writers' "loyalist" memory of Marcos, whereas Rambaud's novel indexes attempts to reassess Marcos and the legacies of his dictatorship. This article seeks to contribute to the literature on the social memory of Marcos's military regime; looks into the braiding of literature, memory, and the nation; and examines the constitution of memory in gender.<br>

Abstract: In the late twentieth century two conceptions of text in a literary work followed from the original distinction between Sinn (smysl, sense) and Bedeutung (význam, reference), which was made by Gottlob Frege in 1892 - namely, those of Wolfgang Iser and Paul Ricoeur. For us, they are interesting for their direct or indirect affinity to Czech Structuralism. The article presents a detailed comparison of the two conceptions: Iser's 'act of reading', culminating in the 'play of the text', and Ricoeur's proposal of 'productive reference', which heads towards the references (Bedeutungen) of a world that is irmagined, without actually being, and announces itself through the creative power of language. The article concludes by returning to the question of the game and reference in the work of Iser and Eugene Fink. Play and art guard the vitality of sense.<br>

Abstract: In view of the pluralism of current exegetical methodologies, constant recourse is had to models for interpretation of texts, be these more ancient stages of the text, as in historical-critical exegesis, or schemes of a logical character as in structural exegesis. What advantages does the use of a model offer to interpretation? With the analysis limited to a narrative text, an examination of the contribution from the philosophy of history (H.-I. Marrou), from epistemology (K. R. Popper), and from philosophical hermeneutics (H.-G. Gadamer,), helps to see in the logical dimension of the different models, the source of their interpretative power. At the hermeneutical level this opens up a perspective of unity in the exegetical methodologies.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between teacher education and the ideology of social control. It does this by looking at the dialectical tension that exists between teacher-education programs and the dominant society through a set of concepts that link as well as demonstrate the interplay of power, ideology, biography, and history. It further illuminates this interplay by analyzing the rationality that presently dominates these programs. Finally, the paper not only examines the implications of this rationality for teacher-education programs, it also points to ways in which it can be overcome.<br>

Abstract: La coexistence de différentes manières de penser l'historicité - qu'elles soient, en particulier, cycliques ou linéaires - est évidente dans l'histoire longue de la Chine et, plus généralement, de l'Asie orientale. C'est ce que démontre l'article de Prasenjit Duara qui, après une réflexion sur les débats historiques et philosophiques portant sur le temps et l'histoire, insiste sur la manière dont les circulations transnationales affectent profondément les formes de l'historicité. Ici, c'est le rapport entre nation et conscience historique qui est examiné à nouveaux frais. Les récits du passé sont peut-être nécessaires à toutes les organisations sociales qui cherchent à se constituer comme telles. Cependant, avant l'apparition de l'Étatnation, ces récits non seulement englobaient des différences et des contestations, mais ils entretenaient aussi une relation à un temps et des idéaux universels ou cosmologiques. L'émergence de la modernité contribua au désenchantement du politique, parallèlement à l'avènement d'États capitalistes en concurrence, qui cherchèrent a mobiliser toutes les formes de ressources et de biopouvoir. Ces histoires de l'État et de la civilisation, linéaires et réifiées, furent essentielles dans cette mobilisation. Un bon exemple peut en être donné avec les récits historiques eurasiens et la manière dont ils circulèrent. Cet article les examine et s'intéresse notamment aux modalités de l'historicité en Asie orientale, en étant attentif à leurs circulations et en insistent sur les voies, à la fois globales et régionales, qu'elles empruntèrent. Leurs forces furent converties en récits historiques linéaires de nations souveraines engagées dans des interrelations de compétitions agressives. Narratives of the past are perhaps necessary in all collectivities that seek to constitute themselves as such. Before the modern nation-state, however, these narratives not only embedded differences and contestations, they also bore a relationship to universal or co~<br>

Author(s): Ezzy Douglas<br>
Abstract: Two central unresolved problems in labour process theory are the disjuncture between structure and agency and the problem of what constitutes 'good' work. This paper argues that a hermeneutic conception of the self as constructed through narrative provides a resolution to these two issues. Hermeneutics conceptualises the self as neither a solitary entity impervious to the influence of others, nor as a mere reflection of objective structures or 'discourses of power'. Rather, in the process of self-interpretation a person uses socially learnt cultural discourses to construct and reconstruct a coherent sense of narrative-identity. Substantive illustrations are drawn from labour process theory, recent developments in management theory, and some more general studies of the meaning of working.<br>

It examines the relevance of power and subjectivity to British I/O sociology and reviews theoretical positions that have influenced this field. Elias's work is examined in some detail, exploring his approach to power, agency, the self, individualisation and discourse. His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the 'networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory. Elias's work also illustrates the need for a lengthier historical perspective than is typically observed in industrial and organisational sociology, and points to the value of studies which look beyond the context of the workplace. Finally, attention is paid to some of the limitations of Elias's work.<br>

Abstract: Following debates within this journal regarding the absence of adequate studies of resistance in the contemporary fields of industrial sociology and organisational behaviour, this paper seeks to understand its reasons and consequences. Through an examination of the history of approaches to the study of power and resistance at work, the grounds for this debate are considered and illuminated. The paper then suggests how this debate might be taken forward through developing the ideas of tactics and strategies and episodic and dispositional power.<br>

Author(s): Gavey Nicola<br>
Abstract: Academic interest in applications of rhetoric to social issues is undergoing a revival. This paper develops a rhetorical analysis of discourse generated by men who have been recently violent towards women. The texts have been drawn from transcribed interviews with 14 men who had recently begun or were about to attend stopping violence programmes. Each 90-minute interview prompted the men on their views towards women, violence and relationships. A range of rhetorical devices within the texts were identified and their effect was analysed. This paper focuses on five devices: reference ambiguity, axiom markers, metaphor, synecdoche and metonymy. The strategic effects of each device are discussed with close reference to sample passages from the transcripts. The paper explores how these rhetorical devices resource discourses of male dominance and entitlement to power, and how these in turn resource men in their violence towards women. Increased sensitivity to the nuanced effects of the rhetoric is seen to improve understanding of how men justify, camouflage and maintain positions of dominance within relationships with women.<br>

Issue: i40113399<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Haney David P.<br>
Abstract: In the apostrophe to "Imagination" in The Prelude, Book 6, a multileveled usurpation occurs which challenges the rhetorical foundation of Wordsworth's poem. The force of will exhibited in this passage is a paradoxical combination of actively exerted power and effortlessness, forced interruption and passively suffered usurpation, in which both the agent and the object of usurpation are put into question. The essential trope in this gesture is the anomalous figure of catachresis, whose uneasy place in eighteenth-century rhetorical classifications resulted from its combination of absolute propriety and absolute impropriety. For Wordsworth, this trope reveals the paradoxical connection between the powerful ground of the imagination's proper being and the abyss of loss and impropriety which threatens the imaginative will.<br>

Date: 10 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Burgan Mary<br>
Abstract: Despite recent critical denigrations of the representation of temporality as a defining interest in narrative, it is important to reappraise the epiphany as a feature of the short stories of "founding" modernist women writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Nevertheless, the association of the epiphanic story with "feminine" writing drove a writer like Doris Lessing to reject the epiphany as an organizing principle in her stories; she chose, instead, the more fabular, allegorical model of a writer like D. H. Lawrence. Finally, however, Lessing, like other women writers of the short story, kept in touch with the intuition of revelation in moments of being whose power act not only as organizers of narrative but also as significations of a kind of feminine sensory apprehension of temporality. This discursive implementation of the moment as the center of modernist women writers' short fiction may be recuperated so as to preserve their achievements from the preference for a decentered écriture féminine.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le célèbre article de Merleau-Ponty, « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », la manière dont on évalue le rapport entre ces deux auteurs détermine ou exprime autant d'interprétations historiques du structuralisme et de choix théoriques ou philosophiques quant aux sciences sociales. Cette filiation se voulait une critique: être fidèle à la découverte de Mauss, celle du caractère central de la réciprocité dans la vie sociale, imposait de dépasser la sociologie vers une sémiologie générale. Cet article s'efforce de montrer qu'il ne s'agit pas là, contrairement à l'interprétation subtile qu'en fit Merleau-Ponty, défaire de la réalité sociale un système de points de vue substituables ou de mouvements córreles de subjectivation, mais de montrer que ce sont les « valeurs » qui, du fait de leur nature, de leur ontologie, doivent nécessairement circuler entre plusieurs points de vue exclusifs et complémentaires. Il revisite la célèbre critique de Lévi-Strauss à Mauss sur l'explication de l'obligation de donner par une « force des choses », et replace l'apport de l'anthropologie structurale dans la philosophie de l'esprit contemporaine, là où elle se confronte aux questions ouvertes par la physique sur l'ontologie des objets quantiques. Since Merleau-Ponty's famous paper « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », the way the link between these two authors has been construed determine or reveal as many historical interpretations of structuralism as philosophical and theoretical choices about social sciences. We know that this vindicated kinship was supposed to be critical: being faithful to Mauss's discovery, that of the centrality of reciprocity in social life, compelled us to overcome sociology in the direction of a general semiology. This paper, in opposition at Merleau-Ponty's subtle interpretation of this move, tries to show that it was not aimed at a redefinition of social reality as a system of substitutablepoints of view and correlated movements of subjectivation, but at t~<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the content given to the term rhetoric and some of the history of its changes. It begins with the sophistic emphasis on persuasion as a means of coming to terms with the phenomenal world around us, through to a modern conception of rhetoric as a deconstructive and critical tool in analysing the power-play of meaning that constitutes texts. This paper tries to reflect on some of these changes, arguing that understanding the term implies that one must also examine the surplus of meaning that informs it. While the word rhetoric is highly ambiguous, this paper tries to demonstrate that such ambiguity need not be viewed as a trial and a hindrance in the search for a correct definition as a precursor for effective discussion on the subject. Instead it argues that an investigation into rhetoric's surplus of meaning is perhaps what constitutes effective discussion in the first place, and that further, such surplus of meaning is one that can be characterised as far more unified than commonly assumed which enables one do more with the term rhetoric than previously thought of, or allowed.

Abstract: This article interprets Mark 14:22-25, using one of the new approaches in biblical interpretation, namely, pragmatic analysis. In pragmatic analysis, a text is considered a linguistic unit composed of linguistic elements (signs) with the scope of communicating a message. Interpretation involves examining the linguistic elements, the relationship between them (the syntax), their semantic valence in view of their communicative potentiality. Reading Mark 14:22-25 with this approach leads us to the conclusion that the evangelist included the institution account in his Gospel primarily to explain the significance and effect of Jesus' death to the reader. By adequately preparing the reader on the power of the word of Jesus before coming to read the institution account, Mark achieves a rhetorical effect: the conviction of the power of the words of Jesus and an admiration for the generosity of Jesus. This elicits in the reader an attraction to enter into Jesus' covenant.<br>

Abstract: The communication of the gospel is sometimes in an 'insider language' of transcendant realities with which the secular world is unfamiliar. How significant an impediment is this? Consider fairy tales are universally understood. They share many of the same elements and functions as testimonies which are at the heart of pentecostalism. We can use stories and testimonies in our ministries? Thus to communicate with secular people we must be willing to put the stories of our lives on trial. The trans-personal dimension must be communicated, for religious experiences can be powerful. The challenge is to find ways to use stories and metaphors to speak to a secularised world of the major doctrines as expressed in The Foursquare Gospel' without losing any of its power.<br>

Abstract: En liant, à partir d'une approche phénoménologique, travail, individu et vie, Michel Henry propose un magistral éclairage de toute l'oeuvre de Marx en tant qu'elle est essentiellement une critique de l'économie et une ontologie sociale. La radicalité d'une telle philosophie économique n'est que très peu soulignée par la pensée marxiste contemporaine, qui n'a sans doute pas donné à l'interprétation Michel Henry l'importance qui est la sienne. Pour autant, sa notion d'individus vivants, ainsi hypostasiés de leurs conditions objectives d'existence, conduit Michel Henry à déformer l'anthropologie de Marx et à en affaiblir la dimension politique. The aim of this article is to show the full critical power of the subjective philosophy of living-labour which Michel Henry develops out of Marx. The radicality of such an economic philosophy was only underlined very little by the contemporary thought Marxist which, one knows it, does not give to the interpretation of Michel Henry the major importance which should be his. For all that, his notion of alive individuals, so taked out from their objective conditions of existence, leads Michel Henry to deform the anthropology of Marx and to weaken the political dimension.<br>

Abstract: A rebours de l'illusion rétrospective qui tend à ancrer le totalitarisme comme abolition de la démocratie dans le phénomène révolutionnaire lui-même, l'œuvre de Rosa Luxemburg se caractérise par l'exigence jamais abandonnée d'articuler révolution et démocratie. La révolution (dont la théorie apparaît dans Grève de masses, parti et syndicat) est chez elle la redécouverte par les masses de l'action politique : c'est ainsi qu'à partir de certaines catégories de pensée arendtienne on peut interpréter la notion de spontanéité, laquelle est auto-organisation et non violence. De plus, Rosa Luxemburg ne cessera de considérer comme essentielle la question de la forme de régime politique appropriée au pouvoir du peuple (d'où ses critiques adressées à la Révolution russe), s'inscrivant en faux contre la notion de « démocratie bourgeoise ». Refusant toute conception de l'action politique comme fabrication, commandement ou stratégie militaire, il y a chez elle une théorie de l'organisation politique d'inspiration machiavélienne, dont l'action est vue comme une intervention dans le présent et la contingence. Cette contingence reste toutefois inscrite dans le cadre fixé par Marx qui fait du conflit de classe la substance de l'action politique. Contrary to the retrospective illusion which tends to locate totalitarianism as abolition of democracy in the revolutionary phenomenon itself, Rosa Luxemburg's work is characterized by the ever present requirement to join revolution and democracy. Revolution (the theory of which appears in Mass strikes, parties and unions) is the masses' rediscovery of political action; one can thus, using certain categories of Arendt's thought, interpret the concept of spontaneity as self organization rather than violence. Moreover, Rosa Luxemburg never ceased considering as essential the issue of the form of political regime appropriate for popular power (which explains her criticism of the Russian revolution), and was opposed to the concept of "bourgeois ~<br>

Abstract: Cette contribution examine l'incertitude et le bouleversement des temps sociaux, à l'aune de l'unification des deux polices de Berlin, depuis la chute du mur, le 9 novembre 1989, jusqu'à l'unification allemande, au 3 octobre 1990. Berlin, à la fois communauté urbaine et Lana politico-administratif, a subitement vu deux polices sur son sol. Deux polices, deux histoires distinctes construites 40 ans durant, en opposition réciproque. Le temps fut décisif dans l'unification de ces deux polices, la seule qui ait contraint les agents à travailler effectivement ensemble, dans l'intimité des mêmes postes et des mêmes patrouilles. Le passé des institutions, appelé en résistance contre l'avenir, le présent des configurations politiques locales, mais aussi l'anticipation de l'avenir par les agents individuels et la temporalité propre de la police, son imbrication dans le quotidien, dans la routine de l'ordre public, toutes ces dimensions du temps ont absorbé la puissance de l'événement pour rendre l'impensable possible. This contribution examines the uncertainty and the social changes through the question of the Berlin two police forces'unification, from the fall of the Wall, November 9,1989, to the German unification at October 3, 1990. Berlin, at the same time urban community and political-administrative Land, suddenly saw two police forces on its ground. Two police forces : two distinct stories built 40 years during, in reciprocal opposition. Time was decisive in the unification of these two police forces, the only one which has constrained the agents to work indeed together, in the intimacy of the same stations and the same patrols. Past of the institutions, called in resistance against the future, present of the local political configurations, but also the anticipation of the future by the individual agents and the police force's own temporality, its overlap in the everyday life, the routine of the public order, all these dimensions of time absorbed the power of the event~<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: The ability of Christian discourse to give people a sense of their identity sustains the concrete church. The cultural revolt of the 1960s which suddenly weakened the power of discursive Christianity in Britain may be partially explained in terms of the deterritorializing power of capitalism. In the context of this deterritorialization the formation of self-identity becomes more difficult and strong religious identities have a new appeal. Post liberal theologians have endorsed the identity-forming power of the church. But Christian identity must still be worked out in relation to what lies beyond the borders of the church. Christians rediscover their own foundational story in the acts and deeds of others. Theological formation should involve not only an immersion in the Christian tradition but also the search for what recognisably shares in the same project that the gospel defines. The history of personalism suggests what this search might look like in practice.<br>

Abstract: The article explores the implications of communist representations of history as it relates to representation and evidence in historical theory. It investigates the attempts of the party historians to establish a historical connection between the "counterrevolutions" of 1919 and 1956: as they argued, the counterrevolution that had been born in 1919 and ruled the country until 1945 and, subsequently, been forced "underground" by the Soviet Red Army and the new communist power, was able to "resurrect itself" once again in 1956. It examines how they attempted to authenticate this historical abstraction through various historical, mostly visual, records: photography, film and exhibitions. The article argues that an unusual attitude towards evidence prevailed in these historical works. Although communist historians boasted of referring to an abundance of original source material, their narrative frames of representation proved to be fictitious: sources were selected not in order to draw conclusions regarding historical processes, but instead to illustrate various pre-figured abstract constructions of history. The aim of this method was to maintain the separation of the empirical source base and the philosophical-theological imagination surrounding the meanings of history in order to unbind the latter from evidence and tie it to political ideologies and commitments.<br>

Abstract: During the reign of Catherine the Great, the question of the origins of the Russian State and people ('the Varagian-Norman question') becomes a matter of wide discussion in Russia and in Europe. It has been a very controversial topic in the Russian Academy of Sciences and the occasion of a violent polemic between historians around 1749-50. It has long been kept secret because of the possible dangerous political consequences for the Monarchy and the national pride. The political power wanted by all means to give its subjects a glorious national history but at the same time to control the story of the origins, the ethnic aspects and possible liberal, parliamentary or democratic interpretations of the beginnings of the Russian State. While western historians (German, French and English) gave their accounts of this founding event to the Enlightened Europe, making this story widespread in the West, Catherine made ancient Russian history part of the new modern national education of the elites. She was writing plays herself and patronizing artists and printers, censuring them occasionally: she tried to orient collective memory and used it as an ideological tool to create a unified empire under her lead. В правление имератрицы Екатерины Великой (1762-1796 гг.) - как в России, так и в Европе - всё активнее обсуждается т н. «варяжско-норманский вопрос», т.е. вопрос происхождения Российского государства и народа. Еще в правление императрицы Елизаветы Петровны (1742-1761 гг.) внутри Российской Академии наук, и прежде всего в 1749-1750 гг., данный вопрос стал предметом острой полемики между историками. Между тем долго опасались огласки, т.к. было принято считать, что самый спор, пожалуй, может вызывать нежелательные политические последствия для Монархии и национальной гордости. Политическая власть стремилась к тому, чтобы в ее основание легла величественная национальная история. В свзи с этим она пыталась иметь контроль над повествованием о своем происхождении, и также об этниче~<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the~<br>

Abstract: The term intellectuals(s) has been in use for scarcely more than one century. What is its definition? What conditions of possibility govern the emergence of the Modern intellectual? How many of these conditions can be traced to the past? The typological approach used here sets the origin of the intellectual's role and status in the new paradigm of power established in Carolingian times (781-804), which displayed a peculiar axiom: the idea that all Power is intrinsically divisible. This view was already five centuriesold when Petrarch claimed the autonomous position of cultural critic—not the Modern intellectual's status, but some of his authority, though on different grounds.<br>

Abstract: Archaeology assumes itself as a discipline through a practice of boundary-making that merges the past with the present. It is, in this practice, increasingly critiqued for being ethnocentric and separating power from the communities it claims to represent. In response, archaeology is experiencing a turn toward "community". Examining two community archaeology case studies, we assess whether archaeology can be transformed into a discipline that productively participates in the liveliness and messy connectedness of objects, peoples, histories and cultures— in contrast to a conventionally detached practice of objectifying other peoples' lifeways. In both cases, archaeological and descent communities play direct and central decision-making roles in this traditionally "distanced" discipline. They demonstrate means of re-figuring archaeology as a participatory practice. Community-founded archaeology is thus shown to transform methods commonly supporting institutional reproduction into a radically indigenous, emically structured, set of knowledge practices and outcomes. Archeologie suppose elle-même comme une discipline à travers une pratique de fabrication limite qui fusionne le passé au présent. Il est, dans cette pratique, plus en plus critiqué pour avoir été puissance ethnocentrique et séparation des communautés qu'elle prétend représenter. En réponse, archéologie connaît un tournant vers une « communauté ». Examen de deux études de cas communautaires archéologie, nous déterminer si archéologie peut se transformer en une discipline qui productivement participe à la vivacité et la connectivité désordre des objets, des peuples, des histoires et des cultures—contrairement à une pratique conventionnelle détachée d'objectiver les modes de vie des autres peuples. En cas, archéologiques et descente communautés jouent des rôles décisionnels directes et centrales dans ce traditionnellement « distanciés » discipline.

Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: Dans l'« Archéologie », Thucydide met en oeuvre les modalités et les conséquences d'une omniprésence de la polis, en tant que phénomène social total, depuis les commencements, puis tout au long des « temps anciens (τά παλαιά) », et jusqu'au présent (νῦν). La description de ce passé antérieur est tantôt celle de l'état présocial ou de la genèse de l'état social de l'homme, tantôt celle des premiers temps des sociétés grecques, alors tournées vers le « développement » (αύξηθῆναι) et préoccupées de leur « puissance » (δύναμις). L'Archéologie entretient avec le présent une relation de distance et d'interférence. De distance, parce que le recours constant à l'expression τὰπαλαιά pour désigner ce moment marque une intention d'objectivation ; d'interférence, parce que les modèles d'intelligibilité élaborés par Thucydide tout au long de son exposé sont, par leur origine, empruntés au présent. Il montre que les concepts se sont forgés, sedimentes, complexifies au cours de cette forme de préhistoire. L'« Archéologie » décrit à la fois les temps anciens et le présent, le présent dans les temps anciens ; elle recourt à des concepts tirés du présent, mais validés parce qu'ils sont opératoires dans les temps des origines. In the «Archeolog», Thucydides brings into play the modalities and consequences of an omnipresence of the polis, as a total social phenomenon, since the origins, then all along the «former past» (ta palaia), to the present (nun). The description of that former past is sometimes that of a presocial state or of the genesis of man's social condition, sometimes that of the early days of Greek societies then bent on «development» (auxethenai) and concerned by their power (dynamis). The Archeology entertains with the present a relation of distance and interference. One of distance since the permanent resort to the expression ta palaia to designate that moment underscores an objectivying purpose; one of interference, since the patterns of intelligibility worked out ~<br>

La duttilità dell'uso «scientifico» della dialettica aristotelica spinge ad ampliare l'ambito della razionalità oltre quello strettamente apodittico dimostrativo, tipico della modernità. La corretta semantizzazione di «uomo in potenza», secondo Aristotele, consente di precisare alcuni concetti ricorrenti nel recente dibattito della bioetica. La ritrovata «efficienza» della causalità del motore immobile, nel XII libro della Metafisica, permette di superare alcune distorsioni ermeneutiche neoplatonizzanti. L'intima connessione di filosofia e amicizia, alla quale tende Aristotele, restituisce l'attività teoretica alla sua dimensione più propriamente umana. The recent publication, Nuovi studi aristotelici, by Enrico Berti offers the opportunity to delineate some aspects of the research profile of one of the greatest living scholars on Aristotle, particularly the emerging four traits. The flexibility of the «scientific» use in the Aristotelian dialectic helps to expand the scope of rationality beyond the strictly apodictic demonstration which is characteristic of modernity. The correct semantisation of «man in power», according to Aristotle, helps to clarify key concepts in the recent debate on bioethics. The newfound «efficiency» of the causality of the unmoved mover in the twelfth book of Metaphysics helps to overcome some of the distorting Neoplatonic hermeneutics. The intimate connection between philosophy and friendship, to which Aristotle turns, restores the theoretical activity to its human dimension.<br>

Abstract: The long lasting wave of Italian refugees, returning to their homeland at the conclusion of World War II and during the decolonization process, arises many questions. First of all the demographical dimension is still unclear, and figures given by historians may present relevant variations. In the second place, their arrival has compelled the administration and political power to better define the boundaries of citizenship, and the answers given to the refugees show the cultural limits of citizenship in our country. Moreover, since the many arrivals have received different reactions by their fellow citizens, from solidarity to annoyance, questions concern the reasons of these different behaviours. Finally, recent historical research has shown that the construction of the public memory of refugees has been a sensible political issue in every country. In the case of Italian expellees, the different levels of attention paid to them show that political support and memory depended mainly on their possible exploitation for territorial claims. When they were considered useless for this purpose, they were not included in the public memory and also historical research has been directed to them with an inexcusable delay.<br>

Abstract: This paper suggests that the vocabulary and meaningfulness of 'evil' can be re-articulated, and to some extent redeemed from the extremes of fundamentalism and relativism. It uses intellectual resources from Nigel Wright, Walter Wink and Rene Girard to reconstruct some foundations for a reworking of evil in human geography. It then presents an account of the reappearance of evil 'after postmodernism' in event, narrative and praxis, arguing that working through and acting against evil reveals its present nature in terms that defy the excesses of right-wing religious fundamentalism and the bland tolerance that can stem from an over-reliance on relativistic thinking. The paper considers how geographies of postsecular practice in areas such as homelessness emerge in response to discernment both of the spiritual interiorities and the exteriorities of landscapes of power, and of the ability of human action to influence these landscapes.<br>

Abstract: Si l'on s'accorde à reconnaître que la légitimité confère au Pouvoir sa plénitude et sa force, son concept répond néanmoins à des principes fondateurs qui l'inscrivent dans des modèles doctrinaux diversifiés. La complexité et l'indécision des critères de la légitimité sont, ainsi que l'enseigne l'articulation de son concept avec ceux de légalité et de légitimité, l'index de son statut fondamentalement problématique qui échappe, comme la politique elle-même, à la neutralité axiologique. Though it may be admitted that legitimacy confers to Power its plenitude and strength, the concept of legitimacy responds nonetheless to founding principles which affiliate it to a variety of doctrinal models. As shown in the cohesion between the concepts of legitimacy and legality, the complex and indecisive nature of the criteria of legitimacy points to its fundamentally problematic status, which, just as politics itself, cannot remain axiologically neutral.<br>

Abstract: Cet article cherche à montrer comment l'expérience de «l'écharde dans la chair» provoque chez l'apôtre Paul un changement important de conviction. La permanence de cette affliction dont il aurait bien voulu être débarrassé lui permet de comprendre comment, au cœur d'une souffrance extrême, la grâce de Dieu donne sa pleine mesure. Les drames de l'existence ne sont plus ressentis comme limite ou abandon de la grâce, mais reconnus comme des lieux où la puissance et la bonté de Dieu peuvent s'exprimer sans se contredire. This article attempts to show how the experience of "the thorn in the flesh" provokes in the apostle Paul an important change of conviction. The permanency of this affliction, from which he would have liked to be freed, permitted him to understand how, in the midst of extreme suffering, the grace of God is fully shown. The dramas of life are no longer felt as the limit or the cessation of grace, but are recognized as scenes in which the power and goodness of God can be expressed without contradiction.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'œuvre de Dostoïevski, le paradigme de l'enfance est omniprésent et incarne la vertu christologique par excellence : la compassion rédemptrice. Chez Nietzsche, ce paradigme est tout aussi central, mais il acquiert une signification foncièrement équivoque, puisqu'il désigne tantôt l'attitude évangélique la plus authentique (le véritable enseignement de Jésus), tantôt son exact opposé : le courage cruel d'une volonté de puissance qui surmonte toute nostalgie de rédemption. Dans cet article, nous avons cherché à montrer que la symbolique de l'enfance permet de saisir de manière condensée les enjeux éthiques sur lesquels ces deux auteurs se rencontrent pour aussitôt s'éloigner radicalement l'un de l'autre. In the works of Dostoyevsky, the omnipresent paradigm of childhood incarnates the perfect Christological virtue: redemptive compassion. In Nietzsche, this paradigm is just as central, but it acquires a fundamentally ambiguous meaning, because it sometimes designates the most authentic evangelistic attitude (the real teaching of Jesus) and other times its exact opposite: the cruel courage of a will for power which overcomes all nostalgia of redemption.<br>

Abstract: Cet article essaie d'évaluer les implications des courants phénoménologiques et existentialistes pour la géographie. Le relativisme socio-culturel conteste des modèles de recherche que la pratique contemporaine n'avait pas questionnés. En transposant la notion de Lebenswelt (monde vécu) en termes de genre de vie, on présente un schéma d'analyse qui pourrait encourager la réflexion critique sur (a) les rapports sociologiques et les relations de pouvoir associés au vécu du géographe lui-même, dans sa pensée et dans sa pratique; (b) la capacité des modèles courants à expliquer l'expérience vécue. This article interprets some claims made by phenomenology and existentialism and evaluates their potential significance for geography. Questions are raised regarding socio-cultural relativism in taken-for-granted research models and their applications. Translating Lebenswelt (lifeworld) in terms of genre de vie, a framework is presented which could facilitate critical reflection on (a) sociological construction and power relations associated with the geographer's own lifeworld of thought and praxis, and (b) selectivity and relative appropriateness of current models for the elucidation of lived experience.<br>

Abstract: L'affirmation selon laquelle le mariage chrétien est le signe efficace de l'union du Christ et de l'Église est une donnée de la Tradition. Elle n'en soulève pas moins, au regard des sciences humaines (ethnologie, psychanalyse), de la philosophie, de la théologie enfin, un certain nombre de difficultés théoriques dont plusieurs sont examinées ici. L'effort ensuite tenté pour les lever aboutit à une présentation nouvelle de la sacramentanté du mariage. Le couple uni et fécond aurait à prophétiser la réconciliation des sexes et des générations. Ainsi témoignerait-il, dans l'Esprit, de ce qui est déjà et qui sera, mieux encore: de Celui qui est et vient: Dieu tout en tous. L'étude se termine en évoquant les pratiques externes et internes du couple qui dérivent logiquement de cette prophétie. Asserting that Christian marriage is an effectual sign of Christ's union with the Church is a datum of the Tradition. It nevertheless raises, as far as human sciences (ethnology, psychoanalysis), philosophy and in fine theology are concerned, a certain number of theoretical difficulties, several of which are here examined. The subsequent effort to overcome them leads to a new presentation of the sacramental character of marriage. The united and fruitful couple should prophecies the reconciliation of sexes and generations. Thus would it testify in the Spirit, what already is and shall be, better still: from Him who is and comes, God, the whole power in all men. The essay is concluded by evoking the external and internal experiences of the couple logically resulting from this prophecy.<br>

Abstract: De François Wahl à Jürgen Habermas, la critique de la cratologie de Foucault a beaucoup évolué. Mais si Foucault n'apparaît plus comme un phénoménologue honteux de la volonté de puissance, trahissant ses prétentions structuralistes, il reste quand même un penseur ambigu qui, à la manière de Heidegger, élabore un discours « empirico - existentiel » à l'aide de catégories « historico-transcendantales ». Pourtant, si la critique habermassienne a le mérite d'attirer l'attention sur un trait central de la modernité que Foucault laisse de côté — la « solidification » des structures collectives —, elle ne nous offre pas, comme la critique de Foucault, les moyens de résister au processus d'intégration et de cristallisation des structures modernes, mais semble plutôt entériner la suprématie du savoir moderne de la contrainte par les structures institutionnelles. Pour notre part, nous pensons qu'une philosophie politique doit répondre, à notre époque, au problème relevé par Habermas avec les méthodes de contestation employées par Foucault. Cette philosophie politique devra même tenir compte, en tant que reflet de la situation actuelle, de l'ignorance de Foucault quant au problème crucial de la logique institutionnelle moderne et du refus par Habermas de toute critique qui vise à produire un conflit avec la logique dominante d'intégration. From François Wahl to Jürgen Habermas, criticisms of Foucault's theory of power have evolved considerably. But although Foucault may no longer be seen as a phenomenologist ashamed of his preoccupation about power, thus undermining his structuralist prétentions, he nevertheless remains an ambiguous thinker who, in the manner of Heidegger, elaborates an empirico-existential argument with the help of historico-transcendental classifications. However, if Habermas's criticism has the merit of drawing attention to a basic feature of modernity which Foucault leaves aside — namely the "solidification" of collective structures — it fails to offer, as~<br>

Abstract: Rompant avec la quasi-unanimité de la philosophie occidentale, de Platon à Marx, laquelle a conçu le pouvoir en termes de pouvoir-sur, de domination de l'homme sur l'homme, H. A. propose de le penser autrement, comme expression de l'aptitude d'un groupe à agir en condition de pluralité de façon concertée, et donc comme pouvoir-en-commun. L'A. différencie soigneusement le pouvoir, qui trouve en lui-même sa propre fin, d'avec la violence, d'ordre instrumental, qui n'est jamais légitime, et d'avec l'autorité, qui présuppose la reconnaissance inconditionnelle et le respect. Elle se demande finalement si tout pouvoir peut se passer du facteur de durabilité qu'est l'autorité d'une fondation. In breaking with the near unanimity of Western Philosophy which, from Plato to Marx, had conceived of power in terms of "power over," of a domination of humans over humans, H. A. proposes instead to think of power as an expression of a group's aptitude to act in a pluralistic environment and in concert, thus as power in common. The A. takes care to distinguish power as an end in itself from violence of an instrumental order which is never legitimate, and from Authority which presupposes unconditional recognition and respect, wondering in the end if all power can do without the durability factor that is the authority of a foundation<br>

Abstract: En vue de se laisser enseigner par les lettres philosophiques, l'auteur s'applique à reconnaître, depuis Platon jusqu'à Nietzsche, l'insistance et l'existence des questions relatives au mal. La nature (quid), l'origine (unde) et la justification (cur) sollicitent toujours et autrement la pensée du mal. Au commencement, de Plotin à Leibniz, le moment ontologique retravaille la question de la nature à partir de la question de l'origine, mais pour résoudre le mal de la volonté dans le non-être du mal. Il faut que s'affirme avec Kant la préséance du vouloir sur l'être, l'auto-position de la volonté libre, pour que le moment éthique associe l'essence positive du mal à la recherche de son origine. Lorsqu'enfin dans la perspective de Nietzsche s'impose le moment généalogique, la question de la théodicée se transforme en question du langage. Là où se dit la justification de la volonté, c'est une volonté de justification qui parle. L'article se conclut en préparant une pensée du mal qui réunirait l'horizon de l'attente à celui de la genèse. The author, with the aim of being taught by philosophical letters, applies himself to acknowledge from Plato to Nietzsche the persistence and existence of the questions relating to evil. The nature (quid), the origin (unde) and the justification (cur) always and in different ways urge the thought of evil. In the beginning, from Plotin to Leibniz, the metaphysical instance works again at the question of nature starting from the question of origin, but in order to solve the evil of the will power in the non existing of evil. It will need Kant's assertion of the precedency of the will over the being, the auto-position of the free will in order that the ethical moment may associats the positive essence of evil to the search for its origin. When "in fine" the genealogical moment forces itself upon Nietzsche's prospect, the question of theodicy is transformed into one of language. Where the question is a justification of the will, it is the wil~<br>

Article Title: Milton's God and the Matter of Chaos<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219828<br>
Date: 10 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Watkins John<br>
Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Article Title: Becoming the Other: The Mimesis of Metaphor in Douglass's My Bondage and My Freedom<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219832<br>
Date: 5 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Yellin Peter A.<br>
Abstract: In his Narrative (1845), Frederick Douglass constructs a self based on conversion rhetoric and binary logic. In the greatly expanded My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he complicates this textual self by both imitating and criticizing tropes conventionally used in the slavery debate, such as metaphors related to animals. Christianity, and manhood. Emphasizing the constructed nature of mimesis and metaphor, Douglass demonstrates his ability to escape the bondage of reductionist language even as he claims the power associated with linguistic mastery. This revision of self emerges from his experience of northern racism, manifested in his limited role in William Lloyd Garrison's organization. Douglass's renunciation of Garrisonian dogma and his entry into political action-including his striking textual reinterpretation of the United States Constitution-coincide with the stylistically "modernist" self of the second autobiography.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i220980<br>
Date: 7 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Womack JoAnn<br>
Abstract: The Mexican state's use of revolutionary history to invoke nationalistic sentiments nurtures a lively tradition of storytelling. Ironically, Buena Vista's storytellers criticize the inauthenticity of official representations of the past even as they draw on the images and ideals of "official" history to weave their own tales. This article argues that discourses of authenticity reinscribe historic distinctions between the community and the state in a language which evokes modern notions of purity and truth. The article highlights the political role of discourses of authenticity within the hegemonic structures of modern state power in Mexico.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i201461<br>
Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Traverso Regina M.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Author(s): Worsley Michele<br>
Abstract: This article draws attention to the ways in which Western psychiatric models of psychopathology applied to the so-called "Cargo cults" of Melanesia have served to endorse colonial and cultural discourses of power. It argues that while the ethnographic evidence indicates the positive and creative potential of such movements, Western assumptions concerning irrationality and the unconscious mind obscure this potential. The concept of autonomous imagination is proposed as a way of understanding these movements without pathologizing them.<br>

Date: 5 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Young Robert<br>
Abstract: A discussion of the concept of power provides the theoretical basis for a semantic analysis of a case in which power changes hands. It is argued that a relationship of power presumes the capacity of ideas to require submission and that changes of power accompany changes in actors' conceptions of reality. The semantic analysis points to a pan-Indonesian conception of how power is created and destroyed. [power, political anthropology, symbolic analysis, complex organizations, Indonesia]<br>

Author(s): Zoetmulder J. Joseph<br>
Abstract: Most students of Javanese culture and society have used a few crucial native terms and concepts to analyze aspects of traditional etiquette, statecraft, and mysticism. A unitary approach to priyayi ethics, aesthetics, and power is developed here by synthesizing themes common to earlier treatments. Several points of disagreement with Geertz's (1960, 1973) descriptions are discussed in conclusion as a way of drawing out lexicographic aspects of the methodology of interpretive anthropology.

Author(s): Whitten Janet Wall<br>
Abstract: Language is constitutive of social reality through the constant articulation and reinforcement of significant linguistic concepts, which give meaning to social relations. Among the Shuar of southeastern Ecuador, discourses on power and knowledge validate the traditional ideological structure and create a new ideological structure through the mobilization of meaning in political speech that legitimates relations of domination. Ideological transformation is assisted by a cultural predisposition to seek non-Shuar sources of technical and symbolic knowledge in the acquisition of power.

Author(s): el Zein Michael<br>
Abstract: The relationships among texts, readers, and moral community are explored in order to understand the dissonance and interplay of personal and textual authority in local Islamic practice (Sunni, Shaf'i branch) among Malagasy-speaking villagers of Mayotte (Comoro Islands, East Africa). A political economy of knowledge approach is linked to an analysis of recitation as a ritual activity in which illocutionary force exceeds referential meaning. The discussion has relevance for the understanding of the relationship between religious knowledge, power, and action in Islamic societies as well as of the interface between the oral and the written more generally.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226394<br>
Date: 11 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Witherspoon Robert<br>
Abstract: An ethnographic study of the words and actions common to a shelter for people considered homeless and mentally ill shows how distinct forms of reasoning and personal agency relate to a set of practical concerns and political exigencies. Whereas the shelter's staff rely on and promote a referential language and direct, active forms of agency, its residents depend on tactical, persuasive uses of language and oblique, reactive forms of agency. Yet because the staff have the upper hand politically, their orientations to language, thought, and action take a more central role in encouraging people to act in sincere and reasonable ways. The residents draw on ideas of sincerity, reason, and personal accountability, but in makeshift ways, with the result that the ideas are caught up in the rhetoric of self-presentation. The article's findings underscore the need for anthropologists to attend to the diverse means, and political, linguistic, and cultural grounds, of human reason and agency.

Abstract: Because so many anthropologists have lost their senses of the smells, sounds, and tastes of the places they study, the major theorists of spirit possession have failed to consider relationships between bodily practices and cultural memory and countermemory. By regarding spirit possession in West Africa sensuously as an embodied practice, the author reveals the phenomenological arena in which cultural memory is fashioned and refashioned to produce and reproduce power.<br>

Abstract: A conflict is a relational space in crisis in which the antagonists determine, in an interactive dynamic, what is at stake. As the negotiation goes by, ego states his truth line, while alter builds his offensive line based on a truth that becomes reality. Defending one’s truth means also fighting for one’s integrity; in other words, defining my truth is also giving a structure to my integrity, to my own self. If the literature of the I has frequently conflicts in its pages, it is probably because the reading pact is tied up to the truth. But making a narrative of the self out of the configuration system can also get the text in another kind of conflict where the frontiers of the diegetic levels become more and more permeable. Despite everything, the illocutary power in autobiographic literature, seems to change the way the « I » sees himself, and gives him a new ethos that suits him fine.<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: Abstract. This paper demonstrates the sorts of questions that arise for sociologically informed disability studies scholarship in the midst of the interactional scenes of access struggles in an educational workplace environment. From my experiences in the third largest building of a large Canadian university, I have recollected ordinary talk that justifies the exclusion of disabled people and have pieced together narratives representing things-possible-to-say-today about accessibility struggles. By using an interpretive sociological approach, this paper explores how meanings of disability are generated through talk that justifies the exclusive shape and inaccessible structures of university life. I demonstrate that access is not a synonym for justice but is a beginning place for critical questioning where social relations between body and space can be thought anew. This paper adds to sociologically informed disability studies scholarship by analyzing how the ordinary everyday narration of disability acts as a social power reproducing the status-quo even as the material environment changes.<br>

Abstract: This paper emerges out of an ethnographic study conducted at the University of Cape Town that explored the dynamics of an intervention providing a ‘safe space’ for university staff to engage in alternative ways with South Africa's apartheid past, the university's institutional culture and with each other. This paper focuses on the social politics that arose between the intervention, its participants and imagined non-participants in relation to the university's ‘transformation’ vision. The interventionist intention was reworked by participants at a ground level into key symbols by which participants shaped the patterns of their behaviours and gave meaning to their experiences. Utilising Ortner's (1973) model for recognising and using key symbols, I argue that ‘transformation’ and ‘safe space’ are
         elaboratingsymbols in that they have conceptual and action elaborating power. These elaborating symbols operate in relay with a kind of logic that ‘crystallises commitment’ from participants to the intervention in an emotionally powerful and relatively undifferentiated manner. In so doing, they render the intervention a ‘summarising’ symbol capable of expressing what their experience means to them as an imagined community in relation to others.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the formative role of the World War II experience in shaping politically relevant memories in postwar Italy. Rather than considering the past a legacy or a heritage—something abstract, malleable and susceptible to serving political interests—the focus here is on the meaning-giving power of memories and symbols in the historical evolution. The birth of Italian democracy after the war was preceded by disruptive events that could have divided the nation. This article illustrates how contested and fragmented interpretations of critical events were structured by and through the dimension of cultural memory, which sustained social and political imaginations, eventually shaping characters and outcomes of the Italian political transformation.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews recent methodological interventions in the field of literary study, many of which take nineteenth-century critics, readers, or writers as models for their less interpretive reading practices. In seeking out nineteenth-century models for twenty-first-century critical practice, these critics imagine a world in which English literature never became a discipline. Some see these new methods as formalist, yet we argue that they actually emerge from historicist self-critique. Specifically, these contemporary critics view the historicist projects of the 1980s as overly influenced by disciplinary models of textual interpretation—models that first arose, we show through our reading of the Jolly Bargemen scene in Charles Dickens's
         Great Expectations(1860– 61), in the second half of the nineteenth century. In closing, we look more closely at the work of a few recent critics who sound out the metonymic, adjacent, and referential relations between readers, texts, and historical worlds in order sustain historicism's power to restore eroded meanings rather than reveal latent ones.<br>

Abstract: There is quite a lot more to say, in fact. As we've seen, cultural cannibalism is a practice that is deeply embedded in and responsive to problems of power. It is crucial to situate discourses of authenticity and mimesis within history to uncover the ways in which poets have worked around and against those discourses. The question of contemporary experimental poetry's response to the abundance and waste of late capitalism, and how the cannibal figures within it, bears further exploration. Twentieth- and twenty-first-century readers must stay attuned to the omnipresence of cultural mastication, as De Campos calls it:
      
               The “new barbarians” are still at it: Consume, produce, repeat.The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Little engaged with current scholarship in world literature, Apter's book is equally selective in its reference to translation studies. Derrida's work in this area is certainly important, and there is no reason why a problem-centered book would need to survey the full range of translation theory, but Apter neglects major figures whose work could enrich her argument at many points. A broader view of the politics of untranslatability, for example, could supplement Derrida's brief essay “Des tours de Babel” with the hermeneutic theory of George Steiner's
      After Babel(Oxford, 1975). Only cited for a comment on Eleanor Marx's Flaubert translation (283), Steiner could have provided valuable insights on the resistance of language to translation, which he sees as stemming from cultures' desire to protect their “alternities” from outside eyes. At least Steiner gets a passing glance. Apart from a string citation in a single footnote (4),Against World Literaturenowhere discusses or even mentions such seminal figures in the “cultural turn” of contemporary translation studies as Susan Bassnett, André Lefevere, Gideon Toury, Harish Trivedi, or Lawrence Venuti, even though from the 1980s onward these theorists revolutionized a previously formalist field to address issues of power, inequality, and the thorniness of language.<br>

Abstract: I am interested in the idea that the survivor and the Muselmann cannot be split apart. This fusion attests to the moral power of witnessing by binding the dead with the living, the privileged with the underprivileged. In speaking for those incapable of speaking, the survivor becomes one with the victim. The same can be said of the little girl in “Requiem for Auntie.” In the speaker's being drawn into her aunt's world, in speaking about her aunt, the speaker's life can no longer be separated from that of her aunt. In the same way, the survivors of the Liberian war can no longer be separated from the dead. They are bound by a common fate, by the open wound of being, a wound that the poet, in line with Aristotelian thinking, seeks to heal.<br>

Abstract: The continental status of Europe was at the same time an announcement of its destiny. Fernand Braudel has pointed out, “To draw a boundary around anything is to define, analyze, and reconstruct it, in this case, indeed, adopt, a philosophy of history.”
         
               Europe's self-definition as a continent represented an explicit separation of itself from Asia as “the East” as well as a diminution of Africa as possessing any prestige as a continental landmass. The European apotheosis reminds one of Theodor Gaster's descriptions of the Rites of Filling (Plerosis) and Rites of Emptying (Kenosis) in the ancient Near East. Europe's continental status accorded vigor, vitality, and power upon its spatiality while simultaneously divesting Asia and Africa of any similar virtues. Gaster's description of what he calls a topocosm emerging from the rites of filling is analogous to various aspects of the European ideology. Gaster describes the topocosm thus:7
            
               The societal religious drama characterized in the topocosm could serve as the model for G. W. F. Hegel's historical-geographical speculation in hisBasic to the entire procedure is the conception that what is in turn eclipsed and neutralized is not merely the human community of a given area and locality but the total corporate unit of all elements animate and inanimate alike, which together constitute its distinctive character and “atmosphere.” To this wider entity we may assign the name topocosm, formed (on the analogy microcosm and macrocosm) from the Greek,
            topos, “place” andcosmos, “world order.” The seasonal ceremonies are the economic regimen of this topocosm…. The essence of the topocosm is that it possesses a two-fold character, at once real and punctual, and ideal and durative, the former aspect being necessarily immerged in the latter, as a moment is immerged in time. It is bodied forth as a real and concrete organism in the present, it exists also as an ideal, time~<br>

Abstract: I remember also being frustrated by Kierkegaard's tendency to reverse the modern idiom, so that he praises the power of “indirect” speech and elevates subjectivity over objectivity. Why, in a world full of objectivistic thinkers, should we start by voluntarily putting our bodies, our sense of what is important in life, and our shared social practices into ontological second place? Likewise, must we settle for Jaspers's mystification of
      ExistenzandTranscendenzby calling them the UNrepresentable? And do we really articulate better how it is to be in a world with others by following Sartre's famous reversal of essence and existence—as if an inverted Cartesianism comes closer to expressing lifeworld concerns than theMeditations on First Philosophy?<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: To understand the effects of killing machines on both the victims and the perpetrators, we need a psychoanalytic supplement, to work through the double bind of ethics and politics. In order to begin to think about our own investments in state-sanctioned violence, we need to consider the ways in which death penalties of all kinds find their place not only in economic and political power struggles but also in revenge fantasies that fuel them, whichever side they are on. To this end, we need to consider the psyche as between reason and unreason, between plight as Kantian duty and responsilbity as Levinasian hostage, in order to bind and rebind ethics and politics, by virtue of our sociality that makes us subjects capable of both love and hate, desire and fear. Once you add the postulations of the unconscious to critical philosophy, it becomes necessary to analyze and avow our own psychic investments in state-sanctioned violence, killing, and war. Psychoanalytic avowal is another form of plight or pledge in the sense of vowing an oath to admit and explore our own economic and psychic investments in the violence we say that we abhor. This is particularly relevant when we feel outraged or wronged and want payback. Recall the “with us or against us” reactions to September 11, 2001, and the continued political discourse on “hunting down” terrorists and “making them pay.” Think, too, of all of the revenge fantasies—too many to begin to list—that populate our cultural imaginary evidenced by popular media, including a new TV soap opera aplty called
      Revenge.<br>

Abstract: Third, on Jan Patočka's status here I think the primary point to mention is that his engagement in phenomenology developed from his beginning with a phenomenological focus on nature and world to his finding himself having to adapt it as a resource of sufficient power to aid in developing a viable response to the crushing politics of Soviet-style social authoritarianism. Indeed, the relativity of purported absolutes within the field of fundamental meaning—with I-centered subjectivity displaced in favor of an asubjectivity—and the living and the endlessly renewed effort to fashion meaningfulness enabled Patočka to develop and put into practice his social and political recasting of the intellectual tradition running from classical Greece to transcendental phenomenology that could renew Czechoslovakia's cultural substance against the rigidities of police-state Bolshevik dogmatism. In this, Patočka was a consummate
            engagedphenomenologist.<br>

Abstract: We find one of the major conditions for this diversification in the growth of SPEP's membership and the number of participants on the programs. In its early days, when thirty or fewer people attended meetings, most sessions could be plenary, and people could expect during the conference conversations on papers and commentaries that everyone had heard. But as the members and range of interest increased, the number of sessions also increased to accommodate the volume of submissions and to lessen conflict with those who felt that their interests had inadequate representation on the programs. Growth brought with it complex new political problems involving incompatible points of view as well as gender and generational differences. The consequences of this growth included diversification and restructuring of the programs, an increased suspicion of and attention to the Executive Committee, an intensified alertness to exclusions, and the formation of a dynamic organization that had less and less to do with its name. These conditions helped to give birth to a new organizational arrangement where centralized power became increasingly fragmented. There was no one mission. There were multiple missions that gave rise to conflict and needed negotiation to function collaboratively, if often with suspicion of each other. But the revolution was not over.<br>

Abstract: Or how about technologies predicted to become dominant that never materialize? The leading contender for a universal development of a technology pronounced in the

Or take the age of steam power: the ship, train, and factory engines powered by steam are all but gone except as tourist attractions (ironically steam is retained for nuclear plants as hybrids of industrial and atomic technologies). Yes, Heidegger's “rustbelt” technologies still operate alongside the new technologies, but as alongside, this already means that they are but one style, region, or type of technology. His descriptors are not an “essence.” From my perspective to avoid looking, phenomenologically and empirically, at specific technologies, to seek a “one-size-fits-all” essence of technology overall, is both arrogant and irresponsible—and badly outdated.<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: That correlationism is a red herring is made plain by turning to the most sensible voice in the new debate, Bruno Latour, who was a student of Michel Serres's and whose work in “science studies”—conducted under the motto of the title of his first major book,
            We Have Never Been Modern—has been to show that science does not drop out of the sky. One would be hard put to differentiate what Latour calls his “non-modernism” from what Continental philosophers (loosely called “postmodern”) are saying. Indeed Latour's work had led to the charge that even he does not “believe in reality,” an objection that only momentarily left him speechless but quickly led to a wonderful book entitledPandora's Hope.
                  There he argues that, far from being opposed to each other, our power of “construction”—read “constitution”—goes hand in hand with “reality.” The more construction—the more sophisticated the scientific community, the more complicated the experiment, the more technical the laboratory instruments, the more funding for research—the more reality science will attain. Unhappily, Latour dismisses phenomenology as a “philosophy of consciousness,” as if the entire history of phenomenology after Husserl never happened. Don Ihde, one of the SPEP's most distinguished thinkers, has called Latour to task on just this point.32
               
                  Latour's point applies no less to religion.33
               
                  Religious beliefs and practices are certainly constructed—in concrete cultures, languages, traditions, and historical worldviews. The people whose practices these are understand (just like the people who actually practice science) both that they have composed these prayers, constructed these places of worship, made these statues, and so on34
               andthat in them they access something real that they have not made.<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The enormity of a particular exigence may be such that one of the only tropes capable of communicating the incommunicable is the one that so adamantly risks miscommunication. Hyperbole stirs one's emotions through the convergence of power and luminosity in a transcendental display of immanental insight that extends beyond the purview of logic and reason, thereby creating the intensity of
         vertige de l'hyperbole, which threatens to dismantle conventions of reason and rationality. Revealing that reason is madness and madness is reason through its “mad audacity,” this vertigo is precisely the disorienting crux of hyperbole's function of expressing the inexpressible and momentarily suspending presuppositions before they are re-oriented toward daring phenomenological and psychological reformulations.<br>

Article Title: “Reading the Past against the Grain: The Shape of Memory Studies.”<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur's work also concentrates on the connection between texts and human action in the world, a fundamental concern of scholars in rhetoric (see Zarefsky
      2010, 79). By deploying Ricoeur's prudent approach to agency, the concept of the agential spiral can advance work in rhetorical studies that seeks to balance the power of individual agents with the impact of social forces (see Anderson2004, Campbell2005, DeLuca1999, Greene2004, Hansen2004, Leff2003, Stormer2004, and Turnbull2004). This struggle for balance can be seen clearly among rhetorical scholars studying public memory, many of whom have noted its simultaneously collective and individual nature (see Dickinson, Blair, and Ott2010, and Phillips2004). Because the return to memory emphasizes the strategic use of language to revise representations of the past, it places agency at the center of historical representation. Yet the precise dynamics of individual and collective agency can be difficult to trace. As historian Wulf Kansteiner has explained, “[Memory] is a collective phenomenon but it only manifests itself in the actions and statements of individuals” (2002, 180). Such discussions can be enriched by theories that forfeit neither collective nor individual agency. Because the agential spiral foregrounds the rhetorical choices of specific agents while also emphasizing their relationship to one another, this framework helps to identify a “more modest role” for the individual subject, without ignoring the fact that memories are created in part by individual and collective rhetorical choices, whether conscious or unconscious (Ricoeur 2007, 37). The individual who both reads and acts thus appears neither as a self-possessed Cartesian subject nor as a mere effect of structural systems.
               As a critical framework, the agential spiral traces the rhetorical influences of individual agents while simultaneously underscoring the fact that the processes of public memory are inherently social.2<br>

Abstract: Alice McEwan, in “The ‘Plumber-Philosopher’: Shaw's Discourse on Domestic Sanitation,” synthesizes Shaw's chronic difficulties with the plumbing at Shaw's Corner, the Shaws' country home in the village of Ayot St. Lawrence, with his reformist views on public health and the “wider implications of how sanitation might link civilization and hygiene to aesthetics.” While connections can be drawn between the playwright and the avant-garde theories of modernist architects, Shaw (as usual) emerges in McEwan's essay with a distinctive vision in which “modern sanitary arrangements … have the power to operate as a cultural trope, revealing truths about how we attempt to organize ‘health’ and manage our bodies in modern society.”<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: Fredric Jameson views Joyce's single-handed construction of “a whole world” as an “image … of a Utopian transformation of human life.”
         
               Jameson's Utopianist notion of construction-as-transformation recalls Morris's dream of the “conscious sensuous pleasure” of all work—when all work is art.68
            
               Yet Jameson stresses that Joyce's work offers merely an image or an illusion of Utopian construction, not a model for progress but a practice immeasurably beyond the power of the vast majority of humankind. However, Jameson appears at first to fail to see that Joyce's work itself already appears aware of this crippling paradox. Jameson views Joyce's work as an “archetypal modernist project”—even goes so far as to offer69
            Ulyssesas “the quickest shorthand reference” to the modernist novel—and thereby linksUlysseswith the “Utopian, anti-middle-class impulses” of high modernism.
               What he fails here to recognize is that70
            Ulyssesis also simultaneously the opposite (or at least the critique) of all this.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: The two most central critiques of the design of Pruitt-Igoe have come from successor movements to High Modernism: Postmodernism, and environment and behavior…. Pruitt-Igoe provides a convenient embodiment of all the alleged failings of Modernism…. Proponents of these new approaches attribute the problems of public housing to architectural failure, and propose as a solution a new approach to design. They do not in any significant way acknowledge the political-economic and social context for the failure of Pruitt-Igoe…. Pruitt-Igoe was shaped by … strategies … that did not emanate from the architects, but rather from the system in which they practice. The Pruitt-Igoe myth … not only inflates the power of the architect to effect social change, … it masks the extent to which the profession is implicated, inextricably, in structures and practices that it is powerless to change.

Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: culturalcritique.86.issue-2014<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Abstract: Examining Agamben's reception of Hannah Arendt, and especially
         The Human Condition, in his theorization of biopolitics, this essay argues thatHomo Sacer I, by identifying Arendt with a quasi-Straussian “political philosophy,” fails to acknowledge the complexity of her conception of history. Far from simply affirming the normative force of classical political categories, Arendt regards these as emerging from a living power of distinction that thinking, by showing the historical process that brings about the effacement of these distinctions, seeks to bring into view. Nevertheless, Arendt's conception of history is not without contradiction: while arguing that metaphysics went astray by subordinating praxis to poiesis, her very account of history suggests that this subordination is inevitable, since only a “poetic,” indeed violent, act of making a distinction can distinguish praxis from poiesis. Precisely this problem lies at the center of Agamben's early engagement with Arendt inThe Man without Content.<br>
