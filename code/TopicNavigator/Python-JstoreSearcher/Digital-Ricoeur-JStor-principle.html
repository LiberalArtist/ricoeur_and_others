  Abstract: The roughly fifteen-year period from Begin’s resignation as prime minister to the election of Benjamin Netanyahu can best be understood as a period of symbolic stagnation. The symbolic equation that had been established in the late 1970s and early 1980s remained firmly in place. Labor’s perspective, especially as enunciated by Shimon Peres, reduced itself to ungrounded pragmatism, what might be called a “Let’s Make a Deal” approach, in which there was no firm ideological principle to guide action. The absence of a grounded perspective on security created a symbolic weakness that became especially obvious in the aftermath of terrorist incidents.<br>

  Abstract: Icon defines itself in act south of the Sahara. Things done, sculpture and dress, combine with things happening, music and dance. A fundamental principle is made manifest: action is a superior mode of thought. Movement serves long-term knowledge with sensuous uprush and spontaneity, answering to the imperatives of life.

For Stoker standard time served a double function: it preserved England’s ontological purity by excising the temporally untranslatable, and it provided a model for a total narrative, able to assimilate various classes, nations, and dialects (spoken by the multinational vampire hunters) as well as various media.

  Abstract: We have come a long way since Bury informed us so firmly that history is a science, no more and no less. Historiography has now become so various and eclectic that it is often difficult to see it as the expression of any specific discipline; historians today seem to be united only by some common concern with the past and by a common allegiance, at least in principle, to respect for evidence, the exercise of critical intelligence, and openness of mind.

  Abstract: The contemporary Western philosophical scene can be characterized in terms of divisions and interactions between approaches to philosophy which assume that their task is inextricably linked to the development of the natural sciences and approaches which often regard this assumption with considerable suspicion. Philosophers who adopt the former approach have the obvious advantage that the project of which they see themselves as a part produces more and more results which are in principle—if not in practice—publicly testable and which appear to confirm their underlying assumption that science is converging towards an already constituted reality as it is “in<br>

  Abstract: In the Baha’i tradition, nonviolence is not a principle derived primarily through exegesis but one given through revelation, to use the Baha’i technical term for its primary scripture. There can be no dispute or discussion on this point by either a follower of the Baha’i faith or those who study and understand this relatively recent religion. What may be a source of discussion is the question of how in the context of the history of religion and religions and especially the history of the Baha’i faith this came to be.

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Abstract: However one chooses to define myth—and as this volume demonstrates, there exists more than one viable option—it is an intrinsically comparative concept, designating as it does a broad class of cross-cultural phenomena. Consider, for example, Georges Dumézil, that great Indo-European mythologist, who made of comparison a type of fundamental intellectual principle: “On ne définit très bien les choses que par comparaison avec autre chose.”¹ To employ the concept of myth in biblical studies, then, is to situate some aspect of biblical literature in relation to “the mythical.” These comparisons may be conceptualized concretely in terms of more or<br>

  Abstract: “Just as we reject the principle of divorcing faith and works, so we reject the principle and the practice of divorcing the life of faith and the life of study,” wrote Father Leo Ward of the University of Notre Dame in 1961.¹ Describing the ideal for the Catholic school, Ward’s rejection invites reflection on Catholic intellectual life. However, this comment, which might galvanize Catholic professors who perceive themselves as exemplars of the ideal, might also solicit quite a different reaction from those outside the professionally academic arena. The public perception of Catholicism does not always incline toward a scholastic tradition.<br>

In doing so, Marion would claim, any autarchic subjectivity (whether transcendental or existential) is dethroned and dismantled in one and the same act that givenness (

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

This prefigures the central concern of Western philosophy with knowledge and science. The origin of Chinese philosophy focuses upon fundamental questions of political and ethical philosophy.

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

  Abstract: If the second vatican council’s contribution to the dialogue between faith and reason in our day has to be understood as a word of continuity in principle, with recognition of discontinuity in situations, then it is equally important to recognize how the situation has been redefined by the Magisterium and ministry of Pope St. John Paul II. Seldom has a papacy been so grounded in guiding the conversation between faith and reason and in showing how, in the life of the pope himself, intellectual and spiritual lives are intertwined.<br>

  Abstract: While few cultural anthropologists practicing today would be willing to label culturally bound human behaviors as “evil,” many apply this label to the gruesome individual and collective acts that constituted the 1994 genocide of Tutsis, politically moderate Hutus, and others defined as an “enemy of the state.” Because evil, conceived of as the opposite of good, is defined by a moral system, its application in a particular context involves moral judgment and violates the principle of cultural relativism, which lies at the heart of anthropology.

She points out that Benjamin draws on an alternative Jewish tradition of understanding the commandment “Thou shall not kill.” In her analysis, the commandment is opposed to a principle of guilt and hence can become the basis for a critique of legal violence. Moreover, according to Butler, the commandment, as Benjamin conceives of it, constitutes the condition for a theory of responsibility that would be fundamentally concerned with the ongoing struggle with nonviolence.

On the other hand (even though he denies it), his argumentation has crypto-theological accents to it: being, which conceals itself in its own names, like the unutterable God of negative theology, safeguarding its truth in a meditative and almost religious experience.

  Book Title: Wallace Stevens among Others-Diva-Dames, Deleuze, and American Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): JARRAWAY DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: In Wallace Stevens among Others David Jarraway explores the extraordinary achievement of Wallace Stevens, but in contexts that are not usually thought about in connection with Stevens's work - gay literature, contemporary fiction, Hollywood film, and avant-garde architecture, among others. By viewing the poet among these "other" contexts, Jarraway considers the nature of self-reflection and pays special attention to the discrediting of self-presence as the principle of identity in American writing - a theme that reflects American authors’ abiding concern for subjectivities that engage the world from spaces of distance and difference. By returning to the work of Stevens, Jarraway seeks to refurbish this preoccupation by linking it to the literary theory of French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, whose work applies to American writers from Melville and Whitman to Fitzgerald and Cummings. Jarraway forges the link between Deleuze and Stevens by drawing out the female subjectivity found in each writer’s work to rethink the more static masculinist premises of being. Informed by a deep knowledge of and fluency with the work of Stevens and Deleuze, Jarraway uses these writers as a means of entry into American literature and culture, Wallace Stevens among Others is a sophisticated analysis that will open new directions for future scholarship.<br>

Grice observed that speakers in conversation seem to observe this maxim, both in speaking and in interpreting, and that it is this ‘unspoken agreement’ which allows communication to take place, despite the indeterminacy of reference which is characteristic of language.

If Heidegger regards poetry as a truthful principle that is the source and foundation of man’s dwelling, Blanchot assigns it an illusory principle that affects both the experience of the writer and the written work itself.

  Author(s) Méndez María-Luisa<br>
  Abstract: In this essay, we examine the history of the Japanese reception of Pierre Bourdieu’s works generally, and his essays on Japan specifically, from the viewpoints of the principle of differentiation and the concept of capital, both regarding international knowledge transfer (Robbins 2012).¹ The Japanese modernization and industrialization processes are always embedded within a unique knowledge transfer process. Japanese modernization processes, especially during the Meiji era, are often identified as
                  Wakon Yōsai(和魂洋才), which means ‘Japanese spirit, Western technology’ (Hirakawa 1971, 2004; Chew 2014). Japanese modernization processes often emphasized the maximization of utility and function in a Japanese spirit influenced by<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps no other artist has offered as comprehensive and layered an exploration of montage as Kurt Schwitters, whose imaginative engagement with strategies of disarticulation and assemblage over four decades casts a long shadow on the art of the twentieth century.¹ Working in a variety of media, Schwitters pushed the bounds of montage with a single-mindedness that is only matched by the doggedness with which he interrogated the enabling conditions of his artistic practice. Yet precisely his reflection on montage as a fundamental aesthetic principle has presented a formidable stumbling block for Schwitters scholars ever since the rediscovery of his oeuvre<br>

It is the aim of this article to draw attention to this relation.² This will be done by examining the following hypothesis: the tertium

  Abstract: Indisputably, gender has been a fundamental organizing principle in Western societies.¹ Intrinsic to the conceptualization of gender is a dichotomy in which male and female, man and woman, are constantly and binarily ranked, both in relationship to and against each other. It has been well documented that the categories of male and female in Western social practice are not free of hierarchical associations and binary oppositions in which the male implies privilege and the female subordination. It is a duality based on a perception of human sexual dimorphism inherent in the definition of gender. Yorùbá society, like many other societies<br>

  Abstract: In recent decades, the vision of a genuinely ecological economics has focused on the principle of sustainability. Capitalism, we are told, should be refashioned as a “sustainable economy” whose growth, in the words of the United Nation’s Brundtland Commission Report, “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of FUTURE generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland 1987). Like other liberal political ideals (e.g., democracy, freedom, tolerance), the ideological work performed by sustainability is complex and multivalent. As Joan Martinez-Alier (2009) notes, ecological economics understands the economy not as a system of exchange but rather as a metabolic<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: Because of my commitment to treat all Scripture as “God-breathed” as well as my commitment to the Conservative Hermeneutical Principle, it is not enough for me to demonstrate how violent depictions of God bear witness to the cross. Since the cross leads me to deny that God acted violently in any biblical narrative of divine judgment, I must offer some alternative account of who brought about the violence that is attributed to God in these narratives. We have seen that this is unproblematic in narratives in which violently inclined people function as instruments of God’s judgments (vol. 2, chs. 16<br>

Besides the illustrations already noted (from opera, stage scenery, and landscape painting), there is another from an art which had its heyday in the previous century. In the pleasure we experience at the sight of a fine landscape garden, he sees the type of that mimetic restructuring of reality which we enjoy in a good drama.<br>

  Abstract: The Enlightenment's critique of tradition was a necessary consequence of the fundamental modern principle that we humans are solely responsible for the course of history. Hence we can accept no belief, no authority, no institutions that are not in some way justified. This foundation, for better or for worse, determined the course of the following centuries. Despite contemporary reactions against it, the Enlightenment continues to shape our own time and still distinguishes Western culture from any other.<br>

The most famous methodological “devices” in Husserl’s phenomenology, the epoché and phenomenological reduction, are precisely moves by which the questioning of the world is to begin authentically, against the unwitting and unquestioned acceptance<br>

  Abstract: Democratic self-government cannot be achieved, even in principle, by way of a politics of popular voice. It requires an inscriptive politics, through which a people struggles to memorialize, interpret, and hold itself to its own foundational commitments over time. I will call this idea: constitutionalism as democracy. The purpose of this and the final three chapters is to lay out the basic terms of constitutionalism as democracy: its theory of judicial review, its interpretive method, its fundamental rights.<br>

It is easy enough to think that the principle of all affected interests exhausts the question of

The care of the elderly, including health care and social care, is in many respects based on this principle: the young contribute to the costs of care for the old, who have a greater risk of disease and handicaps. But the increasing demand for care by the elderly—resulting from epidemiological changes as well as various social processes—is putting solidarity between the young and the old under strain.

  Abstract: This book is the follow-up to Thierry Groensteen's ground-breaking
         The System of Comics, in which the leading French-language comics theorist set out to investigate how the medium functions, introducing the principle of iconic solidarity, and showing the systems that underlie the articulation between panels at three levels: page layout, linear sequence, and nonsequential links woven through the comic book as a whole. He now develops that analysis further, using examples from a very wide range of comics, including the work of American artists such as Chris Ware and Robert Crumb. He tests out his theoretical framework by bringing it up against cases that challenge it, such as abstract comics, digital comics and sh?jo manga, and offers insightful reflections on these innovations.<br>

The anthropological turn of modernity, for the sake of pursuing more pressing matters or more deceivingly fundamental issues, presumed that severing the question of God from the inquiry into the human being’s own identity would give wings to the quest for knowledge. Instead, as postmodernity witnesses, this too-often rated “successful” revolution has yielded a radical dissolution of any unifying principle and thus, of man himself.<br>

  Abstract: The primary

The norm for inspiring and regulating that task is the foundational apostolic reception of that salvific and revelatory event, as witnessed to in Scripture and traditioned by the church. The principle for understanding, interpreting, and applying salvific revelation is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit’s organon for that task is the sensus fidelium.<br>

  Abstract: A distinguished American senator and onetime presidential candidate not long ago delivered an important opinion by stating that America will not achieve peace “by being inoffensive.” In the senator’s view, several recent American politicians had brushed aside or forgotten about a basic international reality, namely, “the difference between America’s friends and America’s enemies.”¹ In making this statement, the senator—knowingly or unknowingly—endorsed a crucial principle famously articulated by German legal theorist Carl Schmitt, to the effect that the core of politics—what he terms “the political”—resides in the “friend-enemy” distinction.

  Abstract: In his approach to the problem of knowledge, Nicolaus of Cusa (1401–1464) can rightly be considered, as Ernst Cassirer observes, “the first modern thinker.” The title belongs to him because he first grasped a principle that modern Western philosophy has erected into an unimpeachable doctrine: the principle that rational or scientific knowledge, properly construed, has to be anchored in measurement and empirical comparison—methods that completely sideline traditional metaphysics (with its claim to deliver speculative knowledge). In his long string of writings, Nicolaus of Cusa never ceased to stress this need for measurement, but with a dramatic twist. Had<br>

It has become commonplace today to recognize that a significant cultural blinder in the United States is individualism, and that nation-states internationally are all too often guided by narrow national interests rather than what is best for the global community.

Considerable attention is regularly given to the question of whether Darwinism and religion are in principle compatible, and in recent times distinguished contributions have been made by Peacocke, Ward, Polkinghorne, McGrath, Pope, Haught, and others that defend religion against polemical attacks in the claimed name of modern evolutionary theory.¹ In a comprehensive article on evolution in the encyclopedic

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have argued that Catholic sexual morality is institutionalized within the confines of marriage and procreation, and we have examined the foundations of two principles that articulate the essence of that Catholic morality. The first principle states that “any human genital act whatsoever may be placed only within the confines of marriage”;¹ the second states that “each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life.”² In contemporary Catholic moral theology, two approaches to understanding these principles demarcate two schools of Catholic moral theology.

  Abstract: Freud’s colossal prejudices, in Wittgenstein’s view, all stem from three underlying assumptions of Freudian theory which he implicitly or explicitly contests. The first of these is psychic determinism, which Freud himself regularly presented as a constitutive preconception that could not be questioned. As Sulloway writes: “Freud’s entire life’s work in science was characterized by an abiding faith in the notion that all vital phenomena, including psychical ones, are rigidly and lawfully determined by the principle of cause and effect” (

  Abstract: The challenge of the Truth Matters conference call to “reclaim truthfulness for the academic enterprise” underscores that a commitment to truth is not an abstract principle but a concrete action. As Plato recognizes, philosopher-rulers need not only “the ability to grasp eternal and immutable truth” but also certain “qualities of character”; in describing these, he begins with “love of the knowledge that reveals eternal reality” and follows immediately with “truthfulness” – for how could “a love of wisdom and a love of falsehood” possibly coexist in one person?¹ Character thus connotes integrity, because virtuous traits are complementary and coherent.<br>

  Abstract: The latest abstract painting offends many people, among whom are more than a few who accept the abstract in art in principle. New painting (sculpture is a different question) still provokes scandal when little that is new in literature or even music appears to do so any longer. This may be explained by the very slowness of painting’s evolution as a modernist art. Though it started on its “modernization” earlier perhaps than the other arts, it has turned out to have a greater number of

The Ionian search for a ground of nature beyond its appearance as well as the Pythagorean distinction between a principle of intelligibility and the reality it renders intelligible made the relation from the more fundamental to the less fundamental an unavoidable issue. Classical Greek philosophy eventually resolved it by means of the form principle. The form resided within the appearing objects of which it constituted the intelligible essence, yet as determining factor it also surpassed them. In his dialogue

  Abstract: For Erasmus the source of theology is Scripture (and also good literature), and the subject matter of theology is the commonplaces (loci) drawn from the divine wisdom in Scripture (and also from nature). What is more, Christ is the center of Scripture and therefore the central hermeneutical principle of interpretation (even of good literature). But the way Erasmus interpreted Scripture and arranged theology was informed by rhetoric. The present task is, therefore, to explore in detail how interpretation, theology, and rhetoric are intertwined. To begin, it might perhaps help to suggest that Erasmus’s formal principle of interpretation was theological (or<br>

As I was no Socrates and Strauss no Diotima, this initiation could not be entirely satisfactory. I had no difficulty in accepting Strauss’s central hermeneutical principle that the key to Plato’s teaching is the dialogue-form itself. What could be more self-evident than that Plato wrote dramas rather than treatises (albeit somewhat eccentric, not to say occasionally boring dramas like the

  Abstract: In 1935, Roman Jakobson noted that all art is influenced by an overarching principle, what the Russian Formalists called the “dominant” (1971 : 82), a structuring orientation characterizing a work or even an entire epoch. Although a narrative may have many functions and embody several forms, an internal hierarchy exists which determines the relative value of its components. The dominant of poetic language is the aesthetic function—its form. Poetry is oriented toward the sign, while prose narrative is directed toward the referent.¹ “Poetic evolution,” says Jakobson, “is a shift in this hierarchy.”<br>

  Author(s) Evans Gillian<br>
  Abstract: Throughout most of Chinese history, males—and especially sons—have comprised the preferred social category in which parents strove to develop emotional and ethical obligation. This relationship has constituted the fundamental value orientation by which Chinese society has traditionally organized itself. But the 1949 communist transformation of society, especially urban life, profoundly altered the parent-son dyad, and in its place the parent-daughter bond became increasingly paramount. Even in the countryside, where the parent-son relationship and the patrilineal principle remained sociological constants, a transformation took place by the late twentieth century. Increasingly, urbanites and some rural residents (Shi 2009; Yan 2003)<br>

  Abstract: The Belgian Constitutional Court holds an ambiguous position towards European law. Whereas, generally, it has recognized its power to review the conformity of a legislative act approving a treaty with the Constitution, it also deploys these treaties, and more broadly European law as enshrined in treaties and other instruments, to decide upon the constitutionality of other laws. Especially in reviews that rely upon the constitutional principle of non-discrimination, European law can play an important role, providing content to that principle.<br>

  Abstract: One of the central issues in the relationship of politics and religion is the status, scope, and limits of religious toleration. Although the principle of toleration is generally taken for granted by most Americans in an almost ritualistic fashion, they tend to ignore the controversial character of the principle itself: what it means, how it is to be applied, what its limitations are, and, in general, how it is grounded in moral and political philosophy. When asked about the moral basis of toleration the general answer is that toleration comes from pluralism, and ours is a pluralistic society. Q.E.D. It<br>

  Abstract: As Samuel Palmer recognized already in 1812, nineteenth-century Christianity in England was both united and divided.¹ Though Christian churches held most of the central teachings of Christianity in common, they diverged significantly in polity, theology, and liturgy. For the ordinary churchgoing Christian, denominational divergence emerged most obviously not in theological discussions, seminary debates, or circulated writings but in the public worship service, where communal worship practices shaped and bespoke religious principle. True, the basic elements of Christian liturgy—Scripture reading, singing, prayer, sermon, sacrament—appeared in almost all worship services, of whatever denomination; but as Palmer points out, how these<br>

The processes which exhibit this quality differ from those with the quality ‘conscious’ in that the former are not present in the current field of consciousness but nevertheless remain psychologically effective, indeed, often far more so than the processes which have the quality of being conscious. The substantive, the ‘unconscious’, expresses the fact that psychological phenomena are not confined in principle to conscious experiences but are profoundly shaped by unconscious forces.

It consists of three types of archival institutions, each of them having clearly defined, state-mandated functions and responsibilities.

  Book Title: Microdramas-Crucibles for Theater and Time<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Muse John H.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Microdramas, John H. Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater.Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamental and about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance.<br>

  Abstract: This book, written in Spanish, focuses on the literary and artistic works of such avant-garde figures as Ramon Gomez de la Serna, Benjamin Jarnes, Antonio de Obregon, Juan Chabas, Rosa Chacel, Claudio de la Torre, Almada Negreiros, Maruja Mallo, Mauricio Amster, Manuel Reinoso, Diego Rivera, and Angeles Santos y Victorio Macho. It identifies the attempt to integrate conflicting epistemological, ethical, and sociopolitical categories as the organizational principle driving the avant-garde novel and art. Seen as a means of escaping the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter, the conflict between ethical institutionism and utilitarianism, and the opposition of liberalism by socialism, this "middle path" manifests itself in the avant-garde on various levels: the theory of representation, the development of the protagonist, and the concept of history.<br>

Public opinion in the North already cast Brown as a “monomaniac” and murderer, but Thoreau linked him to Puritans and Revolutionary fathers who, unlike enfranchised northern whites, would not sacrifice the principle of equality to expedience. Because the Dred Scott case effectively nationalized slavery, Thoreau argued, Brown’s self-sacrificing violence was needed not only to free<br>

In it he created a complex argument, based on the theology of Reinhold Neibuhr, about the moral necessity of political action in a flawed and dangerous world. His remarks describe the fine line between just and unjust war, evoking the principle that warfare is justified “if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the force used is proportional; and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence.” But the speech also asked its audience “to think in new ways about the<br>

  Abstract: From 1999 onward, Habermas has significantly shifted the focus of his political philosophy from questions of democracy and legitimacy within the nation-state to the burgeoning international political domain. In his first such move to international politics, in the mid-1990s, Habermas embraced the “Kantian project” of “Perpetual Peace” and interpreted it as requiring cosmopolitan democracy. In his second phase, in the late 1990s, Habermas began to see difficulties with any attempt to transfer democratic ideals directly to the international system and argued for a more limited conception of a fair negotiating system that cannot in principle attain full democratic legitimacy.

  Abstract: Hegel's "highway of despair," introduced in his
         Phenomenology of Spirit, represents the tortured path traveled by "natural consciousness" on its way to freedom. Despair, the passionate residue of Hegelian critique, also indicates fugitive opportunities for freedom and preserves the principle of hope against all hope. Analyzing the works of an eclectic cast of thinkers, Robyn Marasco considers the dynamism of despair as a critical passion, reckoning with the forms of historical life forged along Hegel's highway.<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: This account of illocutionary force is particularly suited to illuminating struggles for recognition on the part of women who have often entered the public sphere only through the narrative form, in novels, biographies, and autobiographies. Lara is particularly interested in the way in which women take up each other’s lives to make moral claims and to fashion and refashion identities. Hannah Arendt looks at the life of Rahel Varnhagen in order to assume her own identity as a pariah, as a Jew, and as a woman; later, contemporary feminists take up Arendt’s identity as reflected in her biography of Varnhagen to fashion their own. Simone de Beauvoir creates a fictional self to sort through her lived relationship to Jean Paul Sartre, which then becomes the site for contemporary feminists to sort through their own identity and autonomy. This loop occurs repeatedly in what Lara, following Ricoeur, sees as a tripartite mimesis. In mimesis 2, Jane Austen takes up the limited life of the women of her time (mimesis 1) to construct an identity for women that is then taken up again by contemporary women in films of Jane Austen’s novels (mimesis 3) to continue to construct that identity. Moreover, what is told in these looping narratives is the way in which women are and become moral agents. Thus, while many commentators have associated Austen only with Aristotle, with an ethics of virtue, Lara is just as interested in the morality of principle that Austen’s heroines exhibit. Moreover, she emphasizes the extent to which the moral claims Austen raises are validated through the narrative structure of her novels. This is a relationship that Martha Nussbaum also articulates, as Lara notes. For both, it is through the structure of narrative and imaginative speech that moral claims become not only rationally justified but compelling as well.<br>

Abstract: Hurd favors the retributivist principle over the rule of law. Using an argument sure to provoke debate, Hurd concludes that consequentialism’s theory of the right cannot countenance blamed right doing. In contrast, deontology lacks an analogous entailment. Yet Hurd doesn’t explore why the substance of deontology favors retributivism over the rule of law. Her answer might be that this isn’t needed, since moral combat is unacceptably paradoxical. But the deontologist who favors the rule of law doesn’t see it that way, and simply asserting it doesn’t help. Though the arguments may not be conclusive, her book is admirably systematic, rigorous, clear, informed, and reasonable.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: The second part of Hartley’s
         Observations on Manis often overlooked. The well‐known first part elaborates an associationist psychology based on the theory of vibrations and “vibratiuncles” of the nerves. The forgotten second part is an apologetic treatise of morality and natural religion. And it is here that Hartley, in an attempt to render the resurrection intelligible, postulates the existence of an “elementary infinitesimal body in the embryo.” This body has the double function of receiving sensations and bringing about organic development. After death, he explains, it subsists, retains “its power of vegetating again,” and thus makes possible the development of a resurrected body.105Again, body is indispensable for self, since, Hartley writes, “neither the elementary body, nor the immaterial principle, which is generally supposed to preside over this, can exert themselves without a set of suitable organs.”106<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ca.2003.44.issue-3<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: As the object of inquiry increased in scope and complexity (e.g., from grammar to language in context), the area of expertise of each researcher did not necessarily increase proportionally. Researchers adopting or socialized to a new paradigm did not necessarily know more than their intellectual ancestors, nor did they control an area that encompassed earlier approaches. Instead, they were more likely to have expertise in new areas and methods or interests in phenomena that had not been part of earlier research agendas. For example, whereas in the first paradigm training in grammatical analysis (e.g., phonology, morphology, syntax) and historical reconstruction was a requisite, with the advent of the second paradigm this training became less common, and it was left to the individual researcher to decide whether to acquire it. Thus, although the development of each new paradigm has helped to expand the study of language as culture, some areas of research interest and expertise have been abandoned. It is more and more difficult to find linguists coming out of anthropology departments who have a good background in phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics, as well as in diachronic linguistics and elicitation techniques (i.e., working with native speakers to write grammars). The diversity of background and expertise has thus created a wider gap between linguists in linguistics departments and those in anthropology departments. At the same time, the widening of the concept of language and the adoption of analytical concepts used by sociocultural anthropologists and scholars in other disciplines has made linguistic anthropology in principle, and often in practice, more appealing to a broader audience within anthropology. There has been an increase in the number of linguistic positions in anthropology departments in the United States, and there has been a new flow into the field of students with no formal training in linguistics but a commitment to language, discourse, ~<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Several of the essays arein the theological senseapologetic. The first is a selfsituating, at times trenchant criticism of cognitive anthropology. The second is a historical account of psychoanalytic anthropology that is so parochial, so superficial that it hardly merits reading. Juillerat considers neither the critiques of psychoanalytic anthropology nor the research of ethnopsychoanalysts such as Paul Parin in Zurich, Waud Kracke in the United States, or the anthropologically oriented psychoanalysts in India, Japan, and South America. It would be a pity, however, if readers dismissed the book at this point, for the remaining essays are theoretically interesting, ethnographically rich, and at times conceptually disquieting. They include such topics as the nature of the symbol; the relationship between Freuds originary fantasies and LviStrausss basic kinship units (
      atomes de parent); the interaction between individual and collective representations; the conjunction of endopsychic projections of cosmologies and social reality; splitting and metamorphosis in the Yafar conception of death; parallels between the evolutionism in Yafar mythology and in BachofensMutterrecht; the stress on the paternal principle in Freud and the maternal in Jung; a rethinking of Maussian exchange theory that recognizes gifts that impose no obligation; an interpretation of a recent cargo cult that relates the land of plenty to the terror and longing for intrauterine return that is expressed in Yafar myth; and a reinterpretation of Naven as a psychodrama in which the uterine nephewthe eternal herois caught between agnatic law and incestuous ties with the mother. The last chapter consists of theoretical excerpts from JuilleratsLavnement du pre(1995), which, though meant to enrich the reading of Yafar ritual and myth, are difficult to evaluate out of context.<br>

Abstract: Creating a historical identity for a new generation of Dissenters in eighteenth‐century England had certain limits. Calamy’s
      Continuationof 1727 had been alert to the problems of bridging generational differences within Dissent and rebuilding links between the very different worlds of Restoration and Hanoverian Dissent. Neal’sHistory of the Puritansis alert to a different set of problems having to do with with inclusions and exclusions.The History of the Puritansacknowledges the diversity of Hanoverian Dissent. Nevertheless, Neal also draws some lines demarcating legitimate from illegitimate forms of Dissent. The “we” of legitimate Dissent has theological, political, and social boundaries. Thus some refugees from Germany during the 1540s are described as anabaptists “who, besides the principle of adult baptism, held several wild opinions about the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and the person of Christ.”50Neal is generally more conciliatory in commenting on the Baptists. Nevertheless, his anxieties about radical sectaries disturbing social order and challenging the intellectual authority of their superiors run through his account of the seventeenth century, with its clear implications for artisan Baptists in Hanoverian England. One of them, the Baptist’s own historian Thomas Crosby, grouched about Neal’s misrepresentations: “many, even of the learned, and so late an author as Mr Neal, from whom we might have looked for more Christian treatment, have made it their business to represent the Anabaptists, as they are pleased in contempt to stile them, in odious colours, and to write many bitter things, even notorious falsehoods concerning them, nay, to fasten doctrines upon them which they never approved.”51<br>

Abstract: Despite this, metaphysics has indeed replied (whether it should be allowed to or not) to the question concerning man’s definition of himself. And we know well that the Cartesian

Nevertheless, it would be more fitting to doubt this vulgate of Cartesianism, because the texts of Descartes so often contradict it. Contradiction occurs first of all because theego’s very performance of its existence unfolds within a space that is, from the outset, dialogical (with theDeus qui potest omnia, with thegenius aliquis malignius).43Next, contradiction occurs because theegoof thecogitorecognizes that its finite thought culminates in a faculty of will that is paradoxically infinite, “ratione cujus imaginem quandam et similitudinem Dei me refere intelligo” (“in virtue of [which] … I understand myself to bear in some way the image and likeness of God”); and above all the common understanding of the comprehensibility of theegois contradicted because theegoidentifies its faculty of thinking of itself with the image and likeness of God within it, to the point that the faculty of self‐knowing is simply one with the faculty of knowing God: “ex hoc uno quod Deus me creavit, valde credibile est me quodammodo ad imaginem et similitudinem ejus factum esse, illamque similitudinem, in qua Dei idea continetur, a me precipi per eandem facultatem, per quam ego ipse a me percipior” (“but the mere fact that God created me is a very strong basis for believing that I am somehow made in his image and likeness and that I perceive that likeness, which includes the idea of God, by the same faculty which enables me to perceive myself”).44Let us consider this extraordinary text: founding the thinking of self upon my thinking of God, to the point of merging them within the space opened by the image of and likeness to God.

Abstract: Braudel addressed the critics directly in
            The Mediterranean,2d ed. (1972), 2:1243–44: “The question is frequently put to me, both by historians and philosophers, if we view history from such a distance, what becomes of man, his role in history, his freedom of action?” A classic example is embodied in Braudel’s portrait of Philip II himself. “What degree of freedom was possessed by Philip II, or by Don Juan of Austria as he rode at anchor among his ships, allies, and troops? Each of these so‐called freedoms seems to me to resemble a tiny island, almost a prison.” See the conclusion of Part III, 2:1236 that recounts the death of Philip II on September 13, 1598, based on three secondary sources of the 1920s, not from contemporary accounts of Philip’s “good death.” Braudel’s last poignant paragraph suggests that Philip did not know what he was doing: “[Philip] was not a man of vision: he saw his task as an unending succession of small details. Every one of his annotations is a small precise point, whether an order, a remark, or the correction of a spelling mistake or geographical error. Never do we find general notions or grand strategies under his pen.” The king’s “grand strategy,” however, is exactly what Geoffrey Parker set out to demonstrate inThe Grand Strategy of Philip II(New Haven, Conn., 1998). Braudel may be correct that Philip, as a prince, was not a student of geography. But what Philip did study, architecture, emphasized design. No discipline was more useful to understanding “general notions or grand strategies.” Thus, Braudel’s Part III, as traditional as it is often said to be, appears to get the story and the king wrong because Braudel’s steering assumption, not Philip II, was in control: “Good reasons for us to reflect once more on the distance separating biographical history from the history of structures, and even more from the history of geographical areas” (2:1237).

As important as these divisions may have been in composition, they were not announced in delivery; the orator need not say, “Now the peroration begins.” Informational writing by contrast makes formatting as visible as possible; it calls attention to features such as headers, indentation, and, more recently, bullets. Formatting is like the external articulation of structural features in modern architecture.55<br>

Abstract: Here in this final section I would like to situate this conception of comparative theology historically by reflecting on its relationship with the older apologetic theology that in many ways was its precursor. In keeping with the principle of “clarification by contrast,” a comparison of the two will further reveal the defining features of the conception of comparative theology that I have presented in this essay.<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Abstract: Yet, just as a bona fide recognition of others’ worth cannot be produced by a mere moral injunction to esteem difference, a genuine openness to being transformed by others cannot follow from a sheer demand to be open and vulnerable to their truth claims. In order to have a truly self‐transformative encounter with another, a provisional presumption of the other's worth and the accompanying open‐mindedness toward listening to the other are requisite. From a Christian theological perspective, this means that a Christian confessional standpoint that makes such a presumption, namely, some kind of working theology of religions that is favorably disposed to the value of other religious traditions, is necessary. Given that exclusivism refuses to recognize the value of other traditions as a matter of principle, such a working theology of religions would have to be some form of inclusivism or confessional pluralism whose unreserved confession of the uniqueness, centrality, and comprehensiveness of its own parochial way has at the same time a measure of a priori recognition of others built into it.

Abstract: In the shroud, God is “author and autograph, printer and printed text.”
      39The medium that connects the divine author to his divine manuscript is the Word’s body whose blood is the very ink used to compose God’s visible text of salvation.40Christ’s corpse marked on the linen by his own blood is a hieroglyphic, that is, a symbolic and metaphorical expression made of one and only one figure.41Aristotle himself, Tesauro continues, holds that a “heroic and distinguished style” necessarily entails “poetic images and metaphorical connections.”42For Tesauro, hieroglyphics and figures of speech are typical components of divine communication. How could the divinity express his royal concepts but through a self‐portrait in human forms? And why is the Son called “Word,” if not to signify that he arises as image from the “Living Principle”? In the beginning, Tesauro holds, was God’s metaphor, the Word, his visible hieroglyphic.43God created humankind in the image and likeness of his Word, his original “figure of speech.”<br>

Abstract: Our number one theorist, Jacques Derrida, we would argue, embodied what Mitchell called “a founding principle of
   Critical Inquiry’s editorial policy”: “The policy for acceptance of manuscripts rapidly shifted from ‘essays that are correct, or well reasoned, or which contain important discoveries’ … to ‘essays that the editors would like to argue with.’”20Because Mitchell doesn’t name any other “founding principles” in perhaps his most complete attempt to define the journal, it’s safe to say that this istheeditorial principle; it certainly is the only principle named in editorial meetings, along with its collorary, essays that are passionate. Though Derrida did not single‐handedly excite the debate around deconstruction, he generated passionate critical responses with his essays on racism and on de Man. It is likely that in some future generation Derrida will no longer be cited with the frequency he is now. But our prediction is that someone like him, someone who combines polemic with inquiry, passion with professionalism, will be. That is the future of reading, and that is the future of theory.<br>

Abstract: However difficult striving for truth can be, it cannot and may not be abandoned, especially when one realizes that in this area we are merely “on the way to the path of truth.” What kind of truth is at issue? Or rather, which aspects of truth—correspondence, coherence, and/or pragmatic truth? In the case of correspondence truth I follow Donald Davidson, who stresses that in the search for truth we have no direct access to the reality “behind” the various versions of reality that we human beings entertain, but that we can proceed on the principle of epistemological charity, assuming a fair amount of overlap between these versions.
            57Coherence truth strikes me as equally important, since incoherence may be taken to signify epistemic confusion or even chaos, which conflicts with the order and unity that one ultimately expects the truth to possess. As for practical truth, it has time‐honored credentials dating back at least to high scholasticism and was advocated at the beginning of the twentieth century by the pragmatic philosopher William James and, in the latter part of that century, by the equally pragmatic philosopher Habermas. They concur on the notion that the truth of diverse claims is proven in everyday practical life.58Browning, as well, time and again underlines the importance of this pragmatic approach of truth in his writings.59Besides, coherence and practical truth may be regarded as two aspects of one and the same conception of truth, namely, semantic and pragmatic coherence truth.60In the context of this article I cannot but interpret this pragmatic truth in terms of justice, as articulated in human rights, particularly in the principles of human dignity, freedom, and equality.<br>

Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Such a critical hermeneutical circle has two advantages for childhood studies. First, it includes both child and adult perspectives as sources of meaning: prereflective historical horizons that shape adults’ and children’s worlds alike and reflective textual and scientific modes of reflection that are more distinctively adult and toward which children only gradually develop. Children may even, as has been suggested in Jerome Berryman’s adaptation of Ricoeur, be able to explore this prescientific world more authentically than adults through their deep capacities for symbolism and play.
         33But only adults (at least in principle) are fully capable of making arguments about their tradition‐constituted values by subjecting them to cultural and scientific critique and, as a result, taking ultimate responsibility for their own moral perspectives and actions. It is these kinds of critically self‐reflective capabilities that make it meaningful to distinguish the terms “child” and “adult” in the first place. Yet the distinction is a matter of degree rather than kind and does not eject children from the hermeneutical circle itself.<br>

Issue: lq.2006.76.issue-3<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: A genuine atmosphere of deliberation requires three principles: “The basic premise of reciprocity is that citizens owe one another justifications for the institutions, laws, and public policies that collectively bind them. … Together with reciprocity, two other principles specify the conditions of democratic deliberation. The principle of publicity requires that reason‐giving be public in order that it may be mutually justifiable. The principle of accountability specifies that officials who make decisions on behalf of other people, whether or not they are electoral constituents, should be accountable to those people” [
      34, pp. 133, 135]. Within the framework of rights (encompassing justice as fairness) and the process of deliberation according to a discourse ethical approach, librarianship can be better able to address the difficult issues it faces. The reality of pluralism necessitates both rights and deliberation. Deliberation, as a process, cannot help but be dialectical. As has been shown here, there are differing conceptions of right and good, of intellectual freedom and censorship, even of ethical theories. To at least some extent, the discussion and controversy surrounding these issues are antinomies, contradictions between statements that each has reasonable grounds. Dialectics, as a means of resolving contradictions and reconciling division, has its foundations in Hegel. Steven Smith ably summarizes the key elements of a dialectical approach:
               It is by such an approach that we, as a profession, can arrive at a fully formed practical and normative ethics. It would be fruitless to ignore the divisions and disagreements; they must be addressed dialogically. Further, the dialogue is inescapably phenomenological (as described above) in that legitimacy, which includes beliefs and voice, must be assumed by all, with regard to all. The foregoing is an attempt to further the dialogue.Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. ~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: In addition to acknowledging with Plato and Husserl that the possibility of responsibility is based on knowledge and on rendering accounts, Derrida thus recognizes another equally compelling demand without which responsibility is not possible. The Christian paradigm exemplifies this further condition of possibility of responsibility. According to this new conception, responsibility requires a break with established or sanctified dogmas (including the most convincing and convinced
      doxa). Rather than seeking conformity, one may have to set oneself apart from what is publicly or commonly accepted. In other words, responsibility is tied here to heresy in all the senses of the term—particularly, as is the case with Patočka, to a “departure from a doctrine, difference within and difference from the officially and publicly stated doctrine and the institutional community that is governed by it” (GD,p. 26). Heresy is not only “an essential condition of responsibility,” it “also destines responsibility to the resistance or dissidence of a type of secrecy. It keeps responsibility apart … and in secret. And responsibilitydepends on[tient à] what is apart and secret” (GD,p. 26; trans. mod.). Indeed, if knowledge remains only on the threshold of a responsible decision, if a decision is a decision on the condition that it exceeds simple consciousness and simple theoretical determination, the responsible self must, in principle, be unable—that is, run the risk of not being able—to fully account for the singular act constitutive of a responsible decision. It follows from this that responsibility is necessarily linked to the secret—not, of course, in the form of withholding knowledge regarding a specific decision but in the form of an essential inability to ultimately make the reasons for one’s actions fully transparent. According to this essential Christian conception of responsibility (which is also, for essential reasons, heretical), decision making without secrecy remains u~<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: But there also came into view an accompanying rhythm of responses to these failures, both cynical and desperate, that were convinced of the certainty of an impoverished present. The cold war drama became increasingly emptied of its commitment to a brighter future for all—the permanent removal of unevenness—and dissipated into an insane game of military expenditure founded on the model of potlatch, ultimately beggaring the Soviet Union. The collapse of the Wall closed down a conception of a future capable of providing the necessary expectations to induce the present to work for its completion. For Euro‐America, especially the United States, the end of the cold war inspired a noisy triumphalism expressed in forms of endism that merely parroted earlier declarations of the end of ideology, a satisfaction that the moment of
         kairos—self‐realization—had been reached; for others the present meant returning to a scene of ceaseless misery and misfortune and recruiting all available resources from the past. The removal of a scripted, illusory future, coincident with economic transformation everywhere motored by a muscular neoliberal doxa, meant restructuring, limitless privatization, interminable downsizing, outsourcing, endless appropriation by dispossession, and the transformation of the everyday into a day‐to‐day temporality, a time without any future, so to speak. Here, too, we begin to see the appeal to a past as a reservoir of possibilities and for resolving the misfortunes of an endless present, even in societies of advanced capitalism. For “people without a future,” as Pierre Bourdieu named them in France (but he could have been describing any industrial society), “time seems to be annihilated” because “the work salary is the support, if not the principle, of the majority of interests, expectations, exigencies, hopes and investments in the present, as well as the future or the past that (they) imply” (quoted inRH,p. 126).

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Not surprisingly, given its overt presence in the JST account of the garden, the nature of evil and its consequences is a large theme in Smith’s account of the world’s first family. Particular care is taken to reiterate Lucifer’s motives to implement his own plan at the expense of God’s. The reader is told that Lucifer, now the cast‐down Satan, “sought also to beguile Eve, for he knew not the mind of God; wherefore he sought to destroy the world.”
         57Here, to Lucifer’s grandiosity and rebellion is added the additional problem of ignorance, that is, he knows not “the mind of God.” Thus, in the JST version of the garden, as at the council, Satan is displaying not only malice but also a fundamental misunderstanding of the way life works, when he prompts the serpent to argue, consistent with the KJV: “Ye shall not die … ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”58With the council narrative as background, the JST reader sees Satan’s approach has not changed and neither has the substance of his offer: death masquerading as power. Evil is rebellion against God’s plan and the embracing of its opposite: the voluntary or free adoption of an antiorder that seeks to destroy human freedom in order to obtain power as an end in itself. It is Lucifer, not the fallen Eve or Adam, who conveys the definition of sin and defines it in terms of rebellion as a lust for power obtained at the expense of agency and, thus, life itself. Stated as an abstract principle, it is obvious that this characterization of Satan and his goal are not original to the JST. As Ecclesiastes tells us, there is nothing new under the sun; particularly the religious sun. I do not dispute him. My point here is the manner in which this principle is historicized or realized for the reader by its conveyance through narrative and, more especially, the authorized biblical plot rather than a separate narrative.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: In his notion of involuntary memory, Marcel corrects the Aristotelian principle that an object of the imagination that is imprinted in memory cannot coincide with the present experience of the object itself, because “there is no such thing as memory of the present.” Although he espouses the Aristotelian principle that “one can only imagine what is absent,” Marcel sees this principle as invalidated whenever the essential character of a presently experienced sensation coincides with that of a sensation imprinted in memory. In such an instance, one can enjoy the impression of the present sensation to the fullest; thanks to the intensifying “application” of one’s imagination of it, one enjoys, in other words, the impression that a sensation or event from the past is being concretely resuscitated in the here and now. This imaginative appreciation of the present throws one into the bliss of a dimension “emancipated from the order of time” (affranchie de l’ordre du temps) and makes one oblivious of or indifferent to the squalor of one’s “directly felt reality.” Aristotle, “On Memory,” in

Abstract: Earlier I stated that just‐war morality involves a spiritual exercise—an ascesis—demanding political elites and ordinary citizens to discipline their attitudes, practices, and representations of the Other.
         75I also said that such an idea suggests a controversial point that harks back to an idea from Augustine, namely, that virtue is grounded in the practice of confession. We are now in a position to see how that is so. Confession for Augustine was not solely or chiefly a matter of privately disclosing personal temptation and wrongdoing, as is often thought. Such personal reports are part of a more general practice of rendering oneself accountable to standards that one does not wishfully create (or project), objective norms by which to measure one’s subjective leanings and desires. Confession, in short, is a matter of making oneself accountable to standards and purposes beyond one’s immediate interests. For Augustine and for those who follow in his path, self‐knowledge quickly slides into excessive self‐love and self‐deception without objective reference points by which to measure oneself. Self‐knowledge, including one’s personal and social memories, must be tested by the principle of reality. Virtue for Augustine thus relies on the willingness to submit oneself to norms by which to evaluate one’s loyalties and commitments. In our self‐reflexive acts, we must ask ourselves whether our self‐interpretation is grounded in reality or fabricated with an eye toward self‐justification.<br>

Abstract: I want to begin this lecture by expressing my profound gratitude for the appointment as the Edward L. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Theological Ethics.
      1Renowned scholars have occupied the Edward L. Ryerson chair, ranging from its first holder, a physicist, to my immediate predecessor, Richard Saller, a distinguished historian. I am especially honored to be able to join this company of scholars. I am also bold enough to think that it is a tribute to this university that a theological ethicist is recognized in this way. The wide reach of inquiry at Chicago has always included the study of the religions and the many ways societies navigate moral and political challenges. The motto of this university is well chosen.Crescat scientia, vita excolatur: “Let knowledge grow from more to more and so be human life enriched.” This motto includes in principle the conviction that the growth of our knowledge about the religions will also, must also, lead to the increase of human life. Much of what I will have to say today about “humanizing religion” spins around these matters.<br>

Abstract: Gauchet's is a decidedly “political history of religion” that attaches paramount importance to the state. The rise of this “sacral transforming agent” imposed the otherness that once characterized the gods of the first religions on and in society. As a result, the divine appeared ever more remote as an “organizing principle,” and humans were left in a position to “reappropriate” the world. This theologico-political transformation ushered in a long procession of events culminating in the emergence of Christianity, the religion that functioned as a theological conduit for departing from religion. The final act of Gauchet's passion play of the sacred unfolds during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the Protestant and Catholic Reformations and the rise of political absolutism; the former enshrined the freedom of the conscience, while the latter completed the process of cleaving the terrestrial from the divine sphere. Ultimately, individuals came to assert themselves in the void left by a transcendent divinity: “God's greatness, taken to the highest level, puts humans on an equal footing with the mystery of creation and validates their independence as cognitive subjects.” The appearance of the modern individual and the modern state signaled the completion of what Gauchet calls a “revolution in transcendence,” predicated on human reoccupation of the space once entirely controlled by the divine. Nevertheless, the self's past alienation from its origins was not simply overcome but instead transferred to psychological, social, and political dualities that persist both within and among individual selves. As Gauchet observes, “Leaving religion is not like waking from a dream. We originated in religion, we continue to explain ourselves through it, and always will.”

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Just as literature effaces the proper meaning of words, imposing a slippage that leaves the reader with no firm ground to stand on, so this essay effaces the proper meaning of Lévinas's text. To return to Blanchot's letter to Malka, it reveals to us finally what Blanchot meant when he said that in a
         certainway Judaism was so close to him that he could not speak of it. In what way is Judaism close to Blanchot? This proximity is one that must be announced as a distance. In maintaining that distance is not Blanchot declaring himself more loyal than Lévinas to the teaching of deracination, of which Blanchot considers Lévinas to be the teacher? In his letter to Malka and in his rewriting of Lévinas's essay “Heidegger, Gagarin, and Us,” Blanchot is answering Lévinas's call for Judaism to announce a new teaching to the postwar world. Undoubtedly Lévinas intended this call to strengthen both the Jewish community and the broader perception of Judaism's message. Blanchot's interpretation could be interpreted as doing the opposite. At the very least, it ignores the pragmatics of Lévinas's concerns. Yet, for Blanchot, Judaism's political power is only realized in renunciation. Its highest teaching, he suggests, is that there must be a gap between the call and the one in whose name the call is made. This is a space that literature discloses, offering us a mode of political speech that does not operate on the principle of mythical identification but rather ceaselessly interrupts itself, reminding us that fulfillment is not yet.<br>

Abstract: Besides the Aristotelian tradition, Franciscan theology offered Dante, as a lay Franciscan himself, another theory of creatures that focuses on the idea of immanence in nature.
         41Following Francis, the Franciscans bring “creation” to the foreground as the incarnate reality of God's continuing presence in the world. For the Franciscan theologian Bonaventure, nature is everything that exists that is not God but is made by God.42Although adhering to the Aristotelian tradition that man is the rational creature, Bonaventure also discusses how Francis greeted a large flock of birds “as if they were endowed with reason” (eas velut rationis participles salutavit).43Bonaventure states the fundamental principle of Franciscan spirituality—that the natural phenomena of the world reveal their creator, even, one could say, make their creator immanently present: “Creatures are shadows, echoes and pictures of that first, most powerful, most wise and most perfect Principle, of that eternal Source, Light, Fulness, of that efficient, exemplary and ordering Art. They are vestiges, representations, spectacles, proposed to us and signs divinely given so that we can see God.”44<br>

Abstract: If we wish to express the principle of temporality in
         Ulyssesin terms of a formal concept, we could say with Augustine: within the continuous flux of unarticulated consciousness, everything is only to the extent that it is present; the past aspraesens de praeteritis[the present of the past], the present aspraesens de praesentibus[the present of the present], the future aspraesens de futuris[the present of the future]. All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly: the past without any distance, modified and often also deformed, as a mere mirror; the present in a state of absolute contingency, a-causal and without any specificity (without any reference to a hierarchy of meanings), as mere perception; the future entirely as empty projection, in the mode of expectation, of mere intention or of passive desire, but never in the guise of a causal act of the will that would create a future for itself.

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: But Faustus feels little need to read allegorically, to seek the signification that transcends direct presentation, for he never imagines spirit or even presence as anywhere but in signs themselves. Despite striking moments of doubt and panic in which he senses he is deceived, he consistently reads with the belief that spirit is entirely immanent in the letter. That is why he so loves the signs of magic: the lines, circles, schemes, and characters that apparently perform “the metaphysics of magicians” (1.1.51) by seeming to enact visibly, palpably, and presently that letter and spirit, and matter and soul, are one.
      28The fantasy that objects have spiritual efficacy provides his consolation. Indeed, Faustus seems even more invested in the spiritual power of the materiality of the sign than is the devil himself: when at one point Lucifer warns Faustus to “not think of God” (2.3.92), Faustus responds by vowing “never to look to heaven, / Never to name God” (2.3.95–96), as if naming God or performing acts that mark or deal in “the outside” of things were equivalent to thinking about God—as if naming and thinking were phenomenologically identical or produced the same results. For Faustus, naming suffices: for him spirit inheres in surfaces, and being therefore exists only in embodied form. And Faustus manifests this principle both in his epistemology and in his very sense of subjectivity itself. When Faustus reflects on his achievements in medicine—his having helped “whole cities” (1.1.21) to escape plague—he decides that such successes are worthless, and that only by being able to “make men…live eternally, / Or, being dead, raise them to life again” (1.1.24–25) were the medical profession “to be esteemed” (1.1.26). Faustus is not abandoning medicine here in order to take up divinity, as if he thought that the prolongation of earthly life were less vital than the pastoral care of immortal souls. Rather, Faustus is revealing that he conceives of eternal life itself ~<br>

Abstract: Second, what is the relation between practical “reflection” (or decision) and practical reasoning? While no one can choose or avow for me, my reflective avowal must respond to what I take to be reasons, as Larmore’s argument about grounds of commitment contends—and so it cannot “dispense” entirely with reference to others (65). Thus, the authenticity found in practical affirmation or attestation cannot be an experience of complete independence from others (my choice must in principle be intelligible). And so the “irreplaceable nature of each individual life” seen in authentic self-relation (55) cannot be defined negatively as an exclusion of other perspectives: it must instead depend on the energy, effort, or initiative in avowal.<br>

Article Title: Contagion and Cognition: Bodily Experience and the Conceptualization of Pollution (<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 671448<br>
Date: 10 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Feder Yitzhaq<br>
Abstract: A similar dynamic is implied by the biblical depiction of corpse impurity. In particular, Numbers 19:14–15 states that a corpse defiles objects found together with it in an enclosure (
         ʾohel,literally a “tent”): “This is the instruction: In the event a person dies inside a tent, anyone who enters the tent and anyone inside the tent shall be impure for seven days. Any open vessel that does not have a lid fastened around it is impure.” The underlying conception seems to have been that this defilement would spread like a gas.
               As B. A. Levine points out, this mode of pollution is particularly clear from the law of the open vessel in v. 15: “The operative principle is that the impurity present within the structure invades all of its interior air, or space, and only sealed vessels are protected.”67
            
               This conceptualization seems to have shaped, at least in part, the rabbinic elaboration of these laws. The conceptualization of corpse impurity as a gas is evident in various principles, including the assumption that corpse impurity spread in all directions inside a tent and the notion that it tended to escape through openings, that “it is the nature of impurity to exit and not to enter.”68
            
               Why did corpse impurity spread like a gas within an enclosure, unlike the forms of defilement described in Leviticus 15, which required contact? The answer is simple: the spread of this form of defilement was modeled after the dissemination of the stench of a decomposing corpse.69<br>

Abstract: David Parkin identifies and endorses two points critical to my argument, namely, the methodological principle that “the boundaries of the positive are predicated on the definitional challenges of the negative,” and the recognition that “evil is existentially present even if not amenable to set identification.” He refers to my observation that he purposefully excluded witchcraft from themes treated in
         The Anthropology of Eviland accepts my rationale for examining it here. It just may be that when his volume appeared nearly 30 years ago witchcraft was too obvious a place to look for evil, whereas to me it appeared a useful topic to revisit, given current intellectual considerations concerning morality. Interestingly, once Parkin accepts witchcraft as exemplary of human evil, as a move to demystify and de-theologize the category, he himself takes the next step of reintroducing evil conceived supernaturally and how it displaces culpability. The questions of whether evil attacks humans or lies among humans, and of whether evil is other than human or an extension of the human, call into question the boundaries of humanity. Independently of whether morality is divinely ordained or whether religion and morality are conceived as coterminous, the space between human and nonhuman is one of both moral and religious ambiguity. Witches may be something less than human, spirits may be in some respects like people and in others like animals, djinn may be like people except made of fire and air while we are made of earth and water, and angels or devils inhabit a preternatural world somewhere between the natural and supernatural.<br>

Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: But if
      Lear’s emphasis on individual responsibility leaves us without a recognizable political system, it also leaves us without a recognizable ethical system. Though the play thrusts us into the realm of the ethical (l’éthique), this realm does not resolve into an ethics (une éthique).
            Or, to put it another way, the drama does not yield up or yield to a set of general rules capable of determining the proper course of action anterior to or outside of the event. Categorical imperatives cannot tell us what Cordelia ought to do when asked to profess her love, or what Lear ought to do when betrayed by his eldest daughters, or what Edgar ought to do when solicited by his suicidal father. Clearly, these characters must respond to the other, but the quality of their response remains rooted in the moment, deeply infixed in “ripeness” and “feeling” rather than in precepts and rules. With a few notable exceptions (e.g., the treachery of Edmund, the cruelty of Cornwall and Regan), the challenging emotional landscape of this play is not to be navigated by a priori ethical precepts—which is one of the many reasons it feels so Levinasian to me. Whereas someone like Kant envisions ethics as a matter of principle, such that uprightness consists of accepting and enacting impersonal, rational rules, Levinas believes it is unconscionably reductive to regard the other or my relation to him as universal instances or generic abstractions. The other is neither an instance nor an abstraction: he is who he is. Consequently, the ethical experience must be personal and particular, not principled.55
         
            Levinas argues—and I think56
         Learis in broad agreement—that one cannot resort to preconceived imperatives if one is to respond authentically. Rather, what one must do is resign oneself to a thoroughgoing passivity in which responsiveness is determined wholly in the moment, entirely by the other.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>

Abstract: “What is bothering me incessantly is the question what Christianity really is, or indeed who Christ really is, for us today.”
         
               These concerns constitute the organizing principle, the true North Star in Bonhoeffer’s life and theology. From that point of view, the topic of religion as such is not even of central significance for the cluster of problems surrounding the nonreligious interpretation. Bonhoeffer’s systematic-theological focus does not reside in the critique of religion in the first place6
            
               but points rather to the Christological question (What shape does Christ take in our world?) and its ecclesiological implications (How does the church, the community of disciples founded in Christ’s name, make itself manifest in the midst of the world come of age?7
            
               ). Indeed, when Bonhoeffer asks the question of what Christianity is for us, the “us” aspect takes central focus: Who are we? And what has the world’s maturation brought about in our time?8
            
               Bonhoeffer’s short answer is: the historical demise of religion. In the midst of the growing maturation of the world, people become increasingly nonreligious.9
            
               Paradoxically, the world come of age is seen by Bonhoeffer as “more godless and for just that reason perhaps closer to God than the world that has not come of age,”10
            
               that is, the world of religion in which God was de facto an idol, a deus ex machina. Thus the maturity of the world, the fact that humanity is able to arrange itself without the tutelage of religion or God, is no longer the occasion for polemics or apologetics; instead of demonizing worldliness, the church should rather welcome it as a stage in the journey toward human autonomy and ask, “How can Christ also become the Lord over those who are religionless?”11

Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Abstract: To literalize this simile, one may use Jakobson’s well-known formalist thesis, with its delimitation of the specificity of poetic language as projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination: “What is the empirical linguistic criterion of the poetic function? In particular, what is the indispensable feature inherent in any piece of poetry? To answer this question we must recall the two basic modes of arrangement used in verbal behavior,
            selectionandcombination…The selection is produced on the base of equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity, synonymity and antonymity, while the combination, the build up of sequences, is based on contiguity.The poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination.Equivalence is promoted to the constitutive device of the sequence. In poetry one syllable is equalized with any other syllable of the same sequence; word stress is assumed to equal word stress, as unstress equals unstress; prosodic long is matched with long, and short with short; word boundary equals word boundary, no boundary equals no boundary; syntactic pause equals syntactic pause, no pause equals no pause. Syllables are converted into units of measure and so are morae or stresses” (Jakobson 1960, 357).<br>

Issue: jsah.2011.70.issue-1<br>
Date: 03 2011<br>
Author(s): Ortenberg Alexander<br>
Abstract: Viewed in the context of Maybeck's honesty in representing the actual construction of the palace on the inside, the treatment of classical details on the exterior shows the consistency of his approach. Too easily dismissed as "more for an overall effect of keeping with the occasion than for intense and prolonged scrutiny," these details rather symbolize the building's construction in the claylike building material.
         
               Instead of misrepresenting the hardness of stone, Maybeck's details express the plasticity of the plaster from which they were made.37
            
               While evoking the Corinthian order, he refused to reproduce the slender proportions of columns and the crisp details that depended on the use of marble, which could be finely carved and subjected to great vertical loading.38
            
               On the contrary, Maybeck's rendition of these details denotes their highly malleable and impressionable material. In this respect, the classical place was as faithful to the principle of truthfully representing the building's construction as Maybeck's earlier Arts and Crafts–inspired projects.39

Article Title: Ways of Evaluating Teacher Cognition: Inferences concerning the Goldilocks Principle<br>
Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i249721<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Zumwalt Dona M.<br>
Abstract: Although research on teacher cognition is no longer in its infancy, it has largely failed to affect the ways in which programs and teachers are evaluated. In accordance with what Raths and Katz (1985) call the Goldilocks Principle, the notion of teacher cognition may simply be "too big" (too general and vague) for mundane application. This review was designed to compare alternative approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition and to consider ways in which the literature of this subfield may be discouraging its application. Teacher cognition is defined as pre- or inservice teachers' self-reflections; beliefs and knowledge about teaching, students, and content; and awareness of problem-solving strategies endemic to classroom teaching. This paper describes and critiques five different approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition: (a) direct and noninferential ways of assessing teacher belief, (b) methods that rely on contextual analyses of teachers' descriptive language, (c) taxonomies for assessing self-reflection and metacognition, (d) multimethod evaluations of pedagogical content knowledge and beliefs, and (e) concept mapping. In the final section, ambiguities and paradoxes inherent in this literature are discussed, particularly the continued use of rhetoric associated with process--product research. Questions regarding the ecological validity of measurement tools and tasks are raised. A suggestion is made that it may be politically exigent to begin relating measures of teacher cognition to valued student outcomes.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263722<br>
Date: 12 1, 1960<br>
Author(s): Edwards William J.<br>
Abstract: Part 1 shows that while Edwards and Berkeley both regard nature as God's discourse and speak of this discourse in similar ways, Edwards differs from Berkeley in believing that the signs of this discourse signify spiritual and divine realities. Part 2 explains why Edwards thought it reasonable to believe that our world is a world of types and images. Because our world is a world of resemblances and imitations, because spiritual things are its "alpha and omega," and because its beauty is a reflection of God's beauty, our world can be expected to contain images or shadows of divine things. Scripture provides evidence that this expectation is realized. Part 3 shows that these images are not symbols but emblems, and that because emblems are consciously invented, their occurrence implies theism. Part 4 attempts to show that, given the assumptions of classical Christian theism, it is in principle no more difficult to decipher the meaning of the book of nature than to decipher the meaning of an allegorical poem or tale. Part 5 criticizes Perry Miller. Edwards's reflections on types were not influenced by the new science. He did not anticipate Coleridge on the imagination, nor did he "elevate nature to a level of authority coequal with revelation."<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Abstract: The legend is, as custum, the place were the principle of reality is suspended: "the place were day-dreaming is allowed". Actually, in the current practice, the use of this fabulous space/instrument crosses ambits officially destinated to the reverie. Fragments of legend impregnate the entire experience allowing us the most shameless alchemy. If we consider the "legendary" in its pragmatic implications and pass through the question: "what do we do, in the every day life, when we evoke in a more or less explicit way the semantic constellation linked with the notion of legend?", then the "legendary" is not so much the "projective place" where we live for a moment our phantasies, but rather an operation that allows to reconcile concrete interests and ideal values, playing on the demarcation line and mixing up cards skilfully.<br>

Abstract: Steiner gives no evidence of having read Zygelbojm's letter,
although he too formulates the principle that Men are accomplices to that which leaves them
indifferent. Yet he does quote without attribution "one of the last messages received by the
outside world during the rising of the Warsaw ghetto: 'The world is silent. The world knows
(it is inconceivable that it should not) and stays silent. God's vicar in the Vatican is silent;
there is silence in London and Washington; the American Jews are silent. This silence is
astonishing and horrifying' " (150, 160; emphasis in original)

Abstract: Using the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, and against the background of the principle that the real is what is or can be given in a public way in perception as a state of the World, and of the thesis established elsewhere that acts of perception are always epistemic, contextual, and hermeneutical, the writer proposes that objects of scientific observation are perceptual objects, states of the World described by theoretical scientific terms and, therefore, real. This thesis of Hermeneutical Realism is proved by showing how the response of a standard instrument is 'read' as if it were a 'text'. Conclusions are then drawn about a number of topics, including Scientific Realism, Conventionalism, and Cultural Relativism.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20117410<br>
Date: 7 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Horst Steven<br>
Abstract: It has recently been claimed (1) that mental states such as beliefs are theoretical entities and (2) that they are therefore, in principle, subject to theoretical elimination if intentional psychology were to be supplanted by a psychology not employing mentalistic notions. Debate over these two issues is seriously hampered by the fact that the key terms 'theoretical' and 'belief' are ambiguous. This article argues that there is only one sense of 'theoretical' that is of use to the eliminativist, and in this sense some kinds of "belief" (dispositional states, infra-conscious states and the Freudian unconscious) are indeed "theoretical" and hence possible candidates for elimination, while others (consciously occurring thoughts like judgements and perceptual Gestalten) are not theoretical and hence not candidates for elimination.<br>

Author(s): Chenavier Robert<br>
Abstract: Au cours d'une période qui voit Husserl livrer son testament philosophique, la Krisis, l'étudiante Simone Weil ouvre son Diplôme d'études supérieures, en 1930, par le constat du désarroi dans lequel se trouve l'époque et de l'incertitude dans laquelle nous laisse la science. Il faut opérer un retour à Descartes, dans une automéditation proche de celle que recommandait Husserl. Cependant Simone Weil ne s'oriente pas vers une phénoménologie. Loin d'explorer la sphère d'être du cogito, elle cherche à en sortir, plus rapidement encore que Descartes, pour rencontrer la réalité du monde, et inventer une sagesse pour notre condition d'être percevant, ce qui signifie, avant tout, d'être qui travaille. Seul le travail permet d'éprouver la nécessité réelle, et de retrouver « l'union de l'âme et du monde », dans les conditions créées par l'industrie. C'est dans la ligne de la vocation mondaine de la philosophie de Descartes, que Simone Weil amorce sa réflexion sur le rôle du travail comme fondement d'une sagesse, dans ces nouvelles conditions d'existence déterminées par la forme collective de la production. À partir de 1935, elle verra dans la crise un signe de la « faillite de Descartes ». During the period that Husserl was declaring his philosophical testament, Die Krisis, Simone Weil was a student starting her Diplôme d'études supérieures in 1930, mindful of the utter confusion of the times and of the atmosphere of uncertainty generated by science. One must return to Descartes, in a self-meditation similar to the one recommended by Husserl. But Simone Weil did not move toward a phenomenology. Far from exploring the sphere of being through the cogito principle, she sought to escape from that sphere, even more rapidly than did Descartes, in order to confront the reality of the world and to invent a wisdom for the condition of a conscious being, which means, above all, a being who works. Only work makes it possible to experience real necessity and to reestablish « the union of~<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23071596<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott Bede<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Article Title: Phenomenology of Bodily Integrity in Disfiguring Breast Cancer<br>
Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23254812<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): SLATMAN JENNY<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i23353270<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Guery François<br>
Abstract: La précaution a été critiquée non en elle-même, mais comme « principe », à la fois sur le plan juridique et scientifique. Les formulations du principe prêtaient à confusion, à cause du jargon « scientifique » utilisé (cf. absence de preuves, de « certitudes scientifiques »). Liée à l'urgence, la précaution ressortit à une philosophie de l'agir, qui comporte menace, vulnérabilité, anticipation, appréhension, et c'est de ce côté qu'il faut chercher la logique de la précaution. En premier lieu, une « déduction sémantique a priori » (Derrida) permet de mettre en évidence les caractéristiques de la peur, qui justifie la précaution. En second lieu, un rappel de la tradition philosophique confirme cette déduction, rappel qui va d'Aristote (Rhétorique : ce qu'est la peur et comment on est quand on l'éprouve; Éthique à Nicomaque : le courage, l'intrépidité, la disposition acquise) à Heidegger (Être et Temps : la peur comme disposition insigne, esquisse de l'angoisse, du souci, de la responsabilité, de la résolution), en passant par des étapes essentielles : Augustin (la cura, la curiosité), Kant (derniers écrits), Nietzsche (Seconde Inactuelle). Enfin, et en conclusion, la précaution apparaît non comme une démission de la connaissance, mais comme une incitation à mieux scénariser, à mieux gérer l'avenir, en cultivant une imagination anticipative, complémentaire de l'innovation. If Precaution has been criticized, on both a legal and a scientific level, it is not as an approach in itself but as a Principle. The way the Precautionary Principle has been formulated was confusing, jargonistic : lack of proof, of scientific certainty. Linked as it is to the notion of Emergency, Precaution is part of an Acting Philosophy which includes Threat, Vulnerability, Anticipation and Apprehension; its logic is to be found therein. Firstly, a « semantic deduction a priori » (Derrida) will help to define the characteristics of Fear, which justifies Precaution. Secondly, we shall confirm this d~<br>

Abstract: This article summarizes the claims of Owen Flanagan that psychology can make important criticisms of and viable contributions to both religious and philosophical ethics. Flanagan insists that both fields of ethics should pass the test of what he calls the Principle of Minimal Psychological Realism (PMPR). However, in order for Flanagan to escape naïve naturalism, his PMPR test should be used within a hermeneutic philosophy such as that of Paul Ricoeur. Ricoeur's concepts of "diagnosis" and "distanciation" can help the moral theologian find a limited but important role for PMPR.<br>

Abstract: Il est souvent refusé à la philosophie de tenir un discours d'affirmation de Dieu. Face à des objections d'hier et d'aujourd'hui aussi diverses que contradictoires, on veut montrer ici la légitimité d'un tel discours. Celui-ci suppose une double rupture: rupture avec une conception minimal ou formaliste de la raison qui refuse de se prononcer sur le principe de la vie; rupture avec une métaphysique intemporelle qui manque le nécessaire enracinement anthropologique de la question de Dieu. Philosophy is often denied discourse regarding the affirmation of God. Confronting the diverse and contradictory objections of the past and today, an attempt is made to show the legitimacy of such discourse. It supposes a double rupture: with the minimal or formalist conception of reason that refuses to pronounce on the principle of life; and with an untemporal metaphysic that lacks the necessary anthropological roots in the question of God.<br>

Abstract: Depois de clarificar e distinguir os conceitos de autonomia em Kant e John Stuart Mill, que normalmente se considera estarem na origem do Princípio da Autonomia utilizado em Bioética, os autores mostram que o Princípio de Autonomia da Bioética de inspiração anglo-saxónica tem origem no conceito de autonomia de Mill que, contrariamente ao que se tende a pensar, é uma autonomia limitada por várias razões apontadas pelo autor. Depois de mostrarem o modo de articular autonomia e dignidade na Bioética europeia, distinguem entre autonomia e capacidade de exercício de autonomia, para sublinharem as dificuldades da vivência do princípio. Na parte final, mostram a importância das virtudes para a vivência da autonomia na actividade clínica. After clarifying and distinguishing the concepts of autonomy in Kant and John Stuart Mill, who usually are considered to be the origin of the Principle of Autonomy in Bioethics, the authors show that the Principle of Autonomy in Anglo-Saxon Bioethics stems from the autonomy concept of Mill that, contrary to what we tend to think, is a limited autonomy for several reasons cited by the author. After showing how to articulate autonomy and dignity in European Bioethics, they distinguish between autonomy and ability to exercise autonomy, to underline the difficulties of living the principle. In the final part, they show the importance of the virtues to the experience of autonomy in clinical activity.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: Tolerance is a concept fundamental to the order of a pluralistic society. The concept, however, contains within it various dimensions and is therefore subject to misunderstanding (I). This article will first examine the ways in which tolerance as a social behavioural virtue differs from the duty of neutrality required of the public authorities (II). Furthermore, it will discuss whether and to what extend the public authorities are authorised to educate society in tolerance (III). Finally, a distinction will be drawn between the expectation of tolerance and the more far-reaching principle of recognition (IV).<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: Michael Frayn's play, Copenhagen, dramatises as a ghost story the conversation concerning the moral implications of atomic fission among Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and his wife, Margrethe Bohr, in September 1941. This paper argues that the play generalises from the famous uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics to present the necessary appearance of uncertainty at the historical, moral, and theological levels of reflection. The paper traces the meaning of uncertainty back to the 'being of the self' as a cipher for divine transcendence, and it interprets the meaning of uncertainty for the theory and method of theological humanism.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: Whereas the concept of "socialist rule of law" punctuated political discourse in the late 1990s, it is the idea of a "socialist harmonious society" that today casts a strange light, clearly more Marxist than Confucian, on Chinese legal reform. This theoretical framework turns law into a disciplinary principle dedicated to society's moral construction. If law is seen as an instrument for legitimizing power, it remains implicitly but primarily subordinate to the regime's durability. Although more and more ordinary citizens are seizing hold of normative tools being put at their disposal, the party-state, fearful of being outflanked, is seeking to snuff out the democratic ferment contained in forces it has itself unleashed.<br>

Publisher: McGill<br>
Issue: i24352116<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Gaillard Emilie<br>
Abstract: Faire appel à la notion de crimes contre les générations futures est assurément la marque de la progression d'une nouvelle conscience de responsabilité envers l'avenir, la condition humaine future, les autres espèces vivantes et l'environnement. Elle contribue à un changement de paradigme temporel déjà en marche aussi spécifique que nécessaire à notre temps. Reflet d'un nouvel imaginaire international, le projet de formalisation de crimes contre les générations futures recèle des potentialités de transformations inédites et puissantes sur le champ juridique. En prenant appui sur les théories éthiques de la responsabilité transgénérationnelle, il est permis de fournir un éclairage spécifique de la notion de crimes contre les générations futures. Des affinements théoriques peuvent s'avérer nécessaires en considération du contexte de connaissances. C'est une véritable conversion intellectuelle qui se profile avec l'admission d'un principe de non-discrimination temporelle en vertu duquel l'absence d'existence temporelle ne serait plus synonyme d'absence de droits ni de garantie juridique. Une complexification des logiques juridiques pour la mise en œuvre des crimes contre les générations futures est alors imaginable. Formuler des crimes contre les générations futures est également maïeutique en ce qu'ils appellent dans leur sillage la consécration d'un principe de dignité des générations futures. Un tel principe insufflerait une dynamique de recomposition du droit des droits de l'homme en l'ouvrant à la perspective transgénérationnelle. Des perspectives prospectives pour la notion de crimes contre les générations futures sont ouvertes avec l'idée d'intégrer également la protection de la condition humaine future. Quelques mises en garde prospectives sont formulées. Evoking the notion of crimes against future generations is certainly an indication of the development of a new awareness regarding accountability for the future of human, other living species and the environme~<br>

Abstract: Cet article vise à opérer une comparaison des traitements de la relation que le choix entretient avec le destin et la contingence tels qu'ils apparaissent dans le mythe d'Er de Platon et la philosophie pratique d'Aristote. L'hypothèse que nous défendrons est que cette comparaison permet de mettre au jour une inversion consistant dans le passage d'une conception où le choix se trouve mis au principe d'un destin et de son temps clos à l'affirmation d'un choix exclusif de toute idée de destin et constitutif, par conséquent, d'un temps ouvert. The purpose of this paper is to compare the analysis of the relationship that choice has to fate and contingency as they appear in Plato's myth of Er and in Aristotle's practical philosophy. Our hypothesis is that this comparison brings out an inversion consisting in the transition from a conception where choice is conceived as the principle of fate and of its enclosed time to the affirmation of a choice that is exclusive of any idea of fate and founds an open time.<br>

Abstract: Few of the German word creations of modern times were assimilated into other European languages to such an extent as the concept of >Weltanschauung<. The historical reception of the concept in France confirms the principle formulated by Paul Ricœur that asserts the existence of »untranslatable« terms and recommends that we dispense with their translation, and that we make use of such expressions in the original language so as not to distort their content. Why should the notion of >Weltanschauung< have exerted such a strong influence, especially on the French language? The question arises naturally. The translation of >Weltanschauung< into the Polish »światopogląd« is too strongly associated with the tradition of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. It is worth taking stock and systematically working through such issues surrounding the translation of such philosophically important terms. This will help ensure that those key concepts of German philosophy that continue to be important in the Humanities as studied in various European languages, obtain a more uniform and binding form.<br>

Abstract: Thesis XVI: "Aristotle's definitive conception of the anima rationalis as the 'body in
action' clearly shows that Aristotle must have held thinking and willing to be conscious perfor-
mances on the part of the anima rationalis. He could not consistently develop this important
insight however, because the Greek form-matter theme demanded that at least the general
principle of thinking (as rational form principle) be understood as a substance (ousia) wholly
independent of the 'material body'. Because of this Aristotle could only conceive of the faculty
of receptive human thought (thought as dunamis) as part of the human soul, but not the actual
thinking activity (nous poietikos), understood to be the 'form of the body'." Compare Glas

"universal" yet not "exhaustive" or "omnicompetent".... We might say that the scope of the

intensive — it may not compromise the irreducible, non-transferrable authority of a social
institution arising from its "sphere sovereignty".' (Chaplin 2004, 6)<br>

Abstract: On a souvent décrit la modernité en la rapportant à l'idée de sécularisation du politique : à la faveur de la « grande séparation » hobbesienne, le pouvoir serait devenu un lieu vide, dissocié de toute attache à la transcendance, privé même de tout contenu substantiel. Cette étude entend rappeler que la philosophie politique contemporaine ne s'est nullement accommodée de ce processus de déthéologisation : au cours des dernières décennies, son propre a bien été, en s'appuyant sur le constat des « déraillements » de la modernité, de vouloir reconstituer une forme de lien entre le politique et le religieux. Cette intention partagée s'est incarnée dans trois grandes architectures de sens. La première tient dans le paradigme du recouvrement : il s'agit ici, tout en adhérant le plus souvent aux institutions démo-libérales, de replacer le droit politique sous dépendance de la norme religieuse. La deuxième position s'agence, quant à elle, autour du paradigme de la substitution : on saisit le politique alors comme un objet d'investissement religieux. La troisième figure relève du paradigme de la délibération : attachée au principe d'indétermination démocratique, à distance donc de toute primauté du spirituel comme de toute religion du politique, elle se construit, quant à elle, autour du dessein d'articuler, dans l'espace de la discussion civique, les convictions séculières et les croyances religieuses. Dans son ordre propre, la philosophie politique confirme l'hypothèse de l'inscription de nos sociétés dans une forme de post-sécularité. Modernity has been often described via the idea of a secularization of the Political: by way of the hobsian "great separation", power would have become an empty space, dissociated from all attachment to transcendence, deprived even of all substantial content. This study whishes to remind that contemporary Political Philosophy hasn't accommodated with this process of de-theologization: along the last decades, what characterized it has been, f~<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i25472056<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ongstad Sigmund<br>
Abstract: The article investigates in the first part critically dyadic and essentialist understanding of signs and utterances in mathematics and mathematics education as opposed to a triadic view. However even Peircean semiotics, giving priority to triadic, dynamic sign may face challenges, such as explaining the sign as a pragmatic act and how signs are related to context. To meet these and other hurdles an explicit communicational, pragmatic and triadic view, found in parts of the works of Bühler, Bakhtin, Habermas, and Halliday, is developed. Two basic principles are combined and established in a theoretical framework. Firstly, whenever uttering, there will exist in any semiotic sign system, dynamic reciprocity and simultaneity between expressing through form, referring to content, and addressing as an act. Secondly, meaning will be created by the dynamics between given and new in utterances and between utterances and contextual genres. The latter principle explains how meaning merge in communication dynamically and create the basis for a discursive understanding of semiosis and hence even learning at large. The second part exemplifies each of the three main aspects and the dynamics of utterance and genre and given and new by excerpts from a textbook in mathematics education. The concept 'positioning', in use for operationalisation, is explained in relation to main principles of the framework. The article ends focusing crucial implications for validation when moving from a dyadic to a triadic understanding of mathematics and mathematics education.<br>

Abstract: A partir d'une étude menée en avril 2003 auprès de trois ONG guatémaltèques impliquées dans le processus de paix, cet article cherche à interroger les registres dominants en ce qui concerne les modalités de réconciliation de pays ayant connu la guerre. En étudiant les registres locaux de la reconstruction du "vivre-ensemble", l'économie morale et politique dans laquelle ils s'inscrivent, et les champs du discours auxquels ils renvoient, je veux montrer les limites que pose un contexte encore répressif aux approches et pratiques actuellement en vogue dans le domaine de la paix et de la réconciliation. /// Based on a study conducted within three NGOs involved in the Guatemalan peace process, this article interrogates dominant discourses and practices upon which strategies of reconciliation in postwar countries are based. Examining local idioms of the reconstruction of the principle of "living together," and in particular the moral and political economy in which these idioms are embedded and the discursive fields to which they refer, enables us to identify the obstacles that a repressive political context may impose on processes of peace-building and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Regido por la subjetividad, el universo contemporáneo del creer es en todas sus partes de circulación fluida, inmediatamente refractario a cualquier referencia estructurante a estabilidad alguna, excepto cuando postula esta estabilidad como puramente operatoria. El objetivo del creer contemporáneo no consiste en alcanzar una "identidad religiosa" (que se concibe como "estable"), sino demostrar que puede ser un creer dentro del movimiento. En realidad, el concepto de "religión", como también los de "secularización" y de "laicidad" que se le asocian, pasan a ser, en situación de plena legitimidad social de la individualización radical de la construcción de una relación con el sentido, conceptos cada vez más indeterminados y en consecuencia de sobra inutilizables, al menos mientras se persista en reconocerles una pertinencia que les sería propia. La "religión", por ello, no es sino el indicador de recomposiciones más amplias, en las cuales participa, por otra parte, como instrumento de gestión. Así, sólo tiene sentido como objeto de intermediación, un analizador que, contextualizado, puede por lo demás resultar muy precioso. /// Ruled by subjectivity, the contemporary universe of belief is in all its parts of fluid circulation, immediately impervious to any structuring reference to any stability, unless this stability is posited as a purely operating principle. The aim of contemporary belief is not to achieve a "religious identity" (which would be conceived as "stable"), but to show that it can be a belief within movement. In fact, the concept of "religion", as well as the related concepts of "secularization" and "laicism" that are associated to it, happen to become, in a situation of total social legitimacy of radical individualization in constructing a relation with meaning, increasingly indeterminate and consequently utterly useless concepts, at least as far as there persists the will to grant them a pertinence of their own. "Religion", for that reason, is nothing m~<br>

Abstract: Gelley has restated the deManean position as follows: "[T]he scandal of example,
its logical fallacy, lies in the fact that this ethical summons—the obligation to judge—is predicated
not on a law or rule—thus at the level of the general or universal—but on the instance of its
particularity, an instance that cannot in itself suffice to justify the principle in question" (Intro-
duction 14).<br>

Author(s): Lassave Pierre<br>
Abstract: Le mot « traduction » est à l'honneur: le philosophe Paul Ricœur l'érige en principe éthique, la « traductologie » se pose en nouvelle discipline littéraire et un courant de la sociologie des sciences le prend pour paradigme. Au-delà de ce dernier usage analogique, n'y a-t-il pas place pour une sociologie de la traduction qui ne soit pas seulement une sociographie des traducteurs amateurs ou professionnels, ni même une annexe fonctionnelle de la théorie des champs culturels et de leurs échanges inégaux? L'événement éditorial que constitue une nouvelle traduction littéraire de la Bible offre ainsi au sociologue matière à associer ses dimensions linguistiques, institutionnelles et relationnelles pour déterminer une « configuration traductive » exemplaire de la rencontre équivoque entre mondes littéraires, médiatiques et religieux en contexte de modernité avancée. The word « translation » has pride of place at the present time: the philosopher Paul Ricœur sets it up as an ethical principle, « translation studies » become a new international subject and the sociology of sciences takes it up as paradigm. Beyond this last figurative use, the question is how can we draw up a sociology of translation apart from studies of professional sets and transnational cultural exchanges? The New Bible Translation, a recent literary event in the French-speaking world, gives matter for combining linguistic, institutional and relational points of view. This translation case as a sociological configuration accounts for this ambiguous meeting point — at the crossroads between literature, religion and publishing — in advanced modernity.<br>

Abstract: "Does the later Heidegger's attempt to reconcile human freedom with the

principle of historical coherence? Does this reconciliation not in some measure represent
a concession to the resolution of the problem of historical meaning in traditional philoso-
phies of history which Being and Time had sought to undermine?"(286).

Article Title: The Metaphor as a Mediator Between Semantic and Analogic Modes of Thought [and Comments and Reply]<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i327931<br>
Date: 3 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Crocker J. Christopher<br>
Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Author(s): Wei Wang<br>
Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: God is once again afoot in the public sphere. Politics has become a religious obligation. For a new breed of religious nationalist the nation-state is a vehicle of the divine. This essay seeks to accomplish four things. The first is to argue for an institutional approach to religious nationalism in order both to interpret and explain it. Second, I argue that religion and nationalism partake of a common symbolic order and that religious nationalism is therefore not an oxymoron. Third, the essay seeks to explain why religion has become such a potent political force in our time. And fourth-the task that will take up the bulk of the text-it seeks a principle of intelligibility in the semiotic order of religious nationalism that can comprehend its preoccupation with both women's erotic bodies and monies out of national control.<br>

Abstract: A Classical Latin text, Ovid's metamorphosis about Echo, is analyzed using Givón's notion of topic continuity. The analysis reveals iconicity on the paradigmatic level of discourse. A problem encountered in applying Givón's iconicity principle is raised, and this leads to an alternative approach to iconicity in discourse, following Becker. This approach uncovers instances of another type of iconicity in the text, this time on the syntagmatic level, and leads to a discussion of the role of iconicity in the aesthetics of the text.<br>

Author(s): Nagel Marco<br>
Abstract: The coherence of the "Dialogues" can be vindicated in opposition to the widespread view-notably espoused by Jean Starobinski-that their ethical position overturns the Rousseauian synthesis elaborated in earlier systematic works. Rousseau's "Dialogues" amount to a transcendental problem which accepts the self it portrays as given: an account is needed of how this self arises by arguments that move from stated facts to points of principle offered in Rousseau's philosophy. Only then can we recover agency concealed by the rhetorically infelicitous objective, third-person optic Rousseau adopts to present and defend his self.<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Abstract: Partindo do principio de que o surgimento da ciência, vinculada desde a sua origem à filosofia, constitui um dos signos especificos do "espirito europeu", no que Gadamer se aproxima de Husserl, o artigo procura dilucidar em que medida ospressupostos da hermeneutica gadameriana – cujas categorias axiais analisa – esclarecem o pluralismo linguistico que caracteriza a Europa, o qual, por sua vez, funda, pela consciência de alteridade que implica, um expressivo e activo pluralismo cultural. Mostra ainda como "todos nós somos outros e todos nós somos nós mesmos", na medida em que viver a diferença e avaliar a resistência do que é o outro equivale a viver uma nova experiência da própria identidade. Finalmente, dado que a aspiração para a universalidade não se obtém contra o particular e o especifico, mas através destes, o artigo analisa até que ponto o "ideal europeu" de Gadamer converge para uma união, ou seja, para um estado de coisas em que o universal é justamente potenciado pelas diferenças que existem entre as culturas dos povos europeus. /// On the principle that the emergence of science constitutes one of the distinguishing signs of the "European Spirit", this article endeavors to investigate how the presuppositions of Gadamer's hermeneutics sheds light on the linguistic pluralism that characterizes Europe and her consequent sensitivity towards otherness. The article also demonstrates how we at once are ourselves and others to the degree that we experience differences, increasing thus our own sense of identity. Finally, universality is not opposed to the particular and the specific. This is shown in the fact that Gadamer's "European Ideal" points towards a universality nourished by the cultural differences that exist among the peoples of Europe.<br>

Abstract: Partindo do princípio judaico-cristão de que Deus, Ser supremo, criou todas as coisas a partir do nada mediante um acto livre de amor (creatio ex nihilo), o artigo mostra como Santo Agostinho defende que no universo físico, criado e governado por Deus, não há espaço para a desordem ou imperfeição (o mal), mas que a natureza é perfeitamente ordenada e harmoniosa, não havendo, portanto, senão o bem. Desta forma, mostra-se de que modo para Santo Agostinho, existir, ser e Bem são sinónimos. Por outro lado, mostra-se também que o mal físico, ou a imperfeição no universo, não passa de uma ausência ou privação do Bem, que acontece não como ser, mas como não-ser. /// Starting with the Judeo-Christian principle that God, the supreme Being, has created all things from nothing (creatio ex nihilo) by means of a free act of love, the article shows how Saint Augustine defends that in the physical universe, created and governed by God, there is no room for disorderliness or imperfection (evil), but that nature is perfectly ordered and harmonious. Indeed, for Augustine, there exists only the good, so that for him to exist, being and the good are synonymous. On the other hand, the article also shows that physical evil, or the imperfection in the universe, is nothing more than an absence or a privation of the Good, which happens not as being but rather as no-being.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an anthropological reading of mythical and historical texts aimed at exploring the dynamics by which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed and reconstructed. Using Dumont's ideas of hierarchy and Sahlins' work on cultural reproduction, the study presents a synchronie and diachronic analysis of the underlying themes and principles upon which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed. The opposition of visible/invisible is the common principle around which other principles or sets of oppositions are clustered. The study shows that archaic Egyptian cosmology underwent a transformation from a structure based on natural entities into socially significant cosmological system. The paper further elaborates the striking homology between the archaic social cosmology represented in Osirian mythology and Christianity in the early centuries of the Christian era.<br>

Publisher: ESKA Editions<br>

Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Joos Maxime<br>
Abstract: Le concept d' « œuvre ouverte » , tel qu'Umberto Eco décrit, doit son existence aux collaborations avec Luciano Berio, notamment dans le cadre de la gestation d'Opera à partir de 1956. L'ouverture, dans Opera, tient notamment à la multiplicité de signification et à la complexité des références internes et externes, à « l'intégration de différents niveaux de perception » . Passaggio, créé en 1963, réalise le principe brechtien de l'abolition de la limite entre scène et public ; c'est une « action musicale », où le spectateur est pris à partie. Mais parce qu'il se libère de toute cohérence narrative, l'espace musical et dramaturgique élaboré par Berio semble ne dévoiler qu'une ouverture introspective, comme pour mieux rendre à l'écoute sa fonction primordiale. The concept of "open work", as described by Umberto Eco, owes its existence to collaborations with Luciano Berio, among others during the conception of Opera, from 1956. The openness, in Opera, consists among others in the multiplicity of meanings and in the complexity of internal and external references, in the "integration of numerous levels of perception". Passaggio, premiered in 1963, realises the Brechtian principle of the abolition of the border between scene and audience. It is a "musical action" in which the auditor has a share. However, freeing itself from any narrative coherence, the musical and dramatic space elaborated by Berio appears to unveil but an introspective openness, as if to restore hearing's primordial function.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40027959<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Augustyn Leszek<br>
Abstract: The article deals with the philosophy of Nikolai Berdjaev (1874-1948), which he formulated between The Philosophy of Inequality (written in 1918, but published in 1923) and The New Middle-Ages (1924). Berdjaev's philosophy is analyzed in the context of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and its aftermath. The other point of reference is the crisis of culture and civilisation, which affected the West in the inter-war period. Berdjaev's position has been interpreted in view of the archetypal myth of the struggle of the two principles, the principle of order (cosmos) and the forces of destruction (chaos). This myth is tied to the millenialist world view. Berdjaev took an anti-utopian stance. He juxtaposed the utopianrevolutionary principle with the hierarchical-creative one. From this position he criticized among others democracy, liberalism and socialism. In the midst of the crisis of the 1920s he remarked the possibility of spiritual rejuvenation putting forward the concept of the New Middle-Ages. One can say that at that time Berdjaev's philosophy evolved within the conservative-creative framework, from the utopia of conservatism to the utopia of 'free creativity'.<br>

Author(s): Love Jeff<br>
Abstract: My article contends that Dostoevsky's short novel, The Gambler, is marked by a fundamental conflict of temporalities. While the novel seems to embrace bourgeois optimism and the hopeful narrative temporality that serves as its most resourceful literary embodiment, it also seems to adhere to a strikingly anti-teleological and circular narrative structure. This affirmation and denial of temporality as linear, purposive movement is the appropriate narrative emblem of the peculiar world of Roulettenburg and its inhabitants, a world where beginning and end continually risk equivalence and where the parameters of structure have therefore begun to dissolve. What emerges is an acceptance of inevitable boredom, of permanent failure to resolve conflict, that is both constricting and liberating. As an artistic principle of form, this failure declares a "poetics" of hesitation whose temporal dimensions brilliantly reflect the fundamentally ambivalent eros of the gambler, the latter's inability to accept or escape from a debilitating presentness. In creating this kind of narrative conflict, Dostoevsky reverses the characteristic romantic obsession with the allure of pregnant immediacy that is an illusion of god-like vision to which only a most ungod-like being could succumb.<br>

Abstract: The thesis that the German dual system of vocational training as well as skilled labour in general are threatened by erosion is challenged in this article by theoretical arguments and empirical evidence from Norwegian studies. The question is discussed whether the 'erosion thesis' exaggerates the discontinuity of industrial organization principles, thus prematurely devaluating the productive potentials of skilled workers. The author points out that the presumption of an erosion process is based on a restricted concept of 'Beruf' (vocation) and of work organization. Rather than seeing 'process orientation' as an organizational principle that contradicts the concept of 'Beruf', the author argues that it could supplement professional responsibilities, thus extending and renewing the concept. He wonders whether the 'erosion thesis' sufficiently considers the criticism of the neo-classical view of economic behaviour, which was brought forward during the eighties. According to this criticism, the socialization and integration of skilled workers into a professional community can be seen as the well-working institutionalization of a 'practical professionalism' which also includes innovative and future-oriented capacities. Finally, a research perspective is sketched out regarding the future of vocational training and skilled labour.<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: Le rapport entre « conscience » et « identité » forme l'un des deux versants de la conception lockienne du sujet (l'autre étant constitué par la « propriété de soi-même »). La théorie lockienne repose sur la distinction du « mental » et du « verbal », et l'isolement du premier comme élément de la vérité. Elle suppose une reformulation du principe d'identité sous la forme d'une double négation inhérente à l'esprit (Mind) : il est impossible que l'homme ne sache pas qu'il pense, ou pense sans penser. Enfin elle caractérise comme « intériorité » la différentielle de perception et de réflexion qui opère tout au long de l'expérience. Dès lors le temps intérieur peut être intellectuellement et moralement ressaisi dans l'unité de la « conscience de soi ». Consciousness and Personal Identity form together one half of Locke's theory of the Subject (the other half being « self-ownership »). First of all, « mental » and « verbal » propositions (viz. truths) must be clearly distinguished. The principle of identity has to be reformulated in logico-psychological terms, as a double negation: it is impossible for the Mind to think, without knowing that it thinks. Finally the difference of perception and reflexion, which operates throughout « experience », is called an « internal sense » or interiority. As a consequence, Locke was able to call « self-consciousness » the typical unity of morality and understanding which forms the internal « duration » of the Mind.<br>

Abstract: Longtemps méconnue, l'herméneutique universelle des Lumières connaît actuellement un regain considérable d'intérêt. Après une caractérisation générale du profil de cette herméneutique, l'étude se focalise sur le Précis d'herméneutique de G.F. Meier, en prenant pour guide la thèse que le principe d'équité herméneutique forme l'âme de toute herméneutique qui se veut philosophique. Même s'il paraît difficile de faire encore de ce principe la clé de voûte épistémologique de l'herméneutique, les thèses de Meier relatives à ce principe conservent toute leur actualité, notamment dans les débats anglo-saxons récents relatifs au « principle of charity », de même qu'elles montrent la voie à une éthique de l'interprétation. The triumph of the romantic paradigm of hermeneutics as a general theory of understanding has partially hidden the former general hermeneutics of the Enligthment. In the current discussion about radical interpretation, we have good reasons to rediscover this older model. G.F. Meier's idea of a general hermeneutics including natural as well as artificial signs is under this respect of a special interest. The article focusses on Meier's statement that the principle of hermeneutic equity is the soul of a philosophical hermeneutics. Although it is impossible to maintain this principle as the epistemological foundation of hermeneutics, it shows the way toward an ethics of interpretation, which shades a new light on the debates regarding the so-called « principle of charity ».<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Abstract: O artigo pretende apresentar um novo modelo de distribuição das ajudas sociais na França, modelo esse entretanto conhecido pelo nome de "alocação personalizada". Trata-se de um mecanismo que, em seu mesmo funcionamento e nas suas justificações éticas, se opõe seja ao sistema actual dominante, herdeiro do Estado-Provi-dência, seja ao projecto alternativo de alocação universal, ou basic income, entretanto amplamente debatido. Objectivo principal do artigo, porém, é explorar os fundamentos filosóficos subjacentes à proposta em causa. Tal como o próprio nome indica, o princípio da "alocação personalizada" apoia-se sobre o contributo de uma filosofia social específica, o personalismo. Assim, evocando principalmente os escritos de Emmanuel Mounier e de Max Scheler, os autores pretendem mostrar até que ponto esta filosofia social suporta uma concepção original da solidariedade, ela própria fundada sobre uma relação específica aos outros. Neste sentido, a proposta que aqui se faz em favor de uma "alocação personalizada" pode ser lida e interpretada como uma aplicação directa da perspectiva personalista a um problema preciso de economia política, a saber, o da organização da assistência social. This paper intends to present a new model for distribution of social assistance in France, a model which has been known by the name of "personalized allocation". It is a mechanism which opposes itself, in its own functioning and in its ethical justifications, both to the present dominant system, heir to the Welfare State, and to the alternative project of universal allocation, or basic income, which in the mean-while has been largely debated. The main aim of this paper, then, is to explore the philosophical fundaments underlying the proposal of the model in question. Like the very name indicates, the principle of "personalized allocation" is based on the contribution of a specific social philosophy, namely personalism. Thus, chiefly calling forth the writings of Emmanuel Mounier and M~<br>

Abstract: O artigo tem por objectivo mostrar até que ponto o princípio de subjectividade presente na Escola Austríaca de Economia se revela fundamentado na tradição fenomenològica de Edmund Husserl e no seu pensamento acerca da constituição intersubjectiva do mundo da vida. Nesse sentido, o autor propõe uma hermenêutica realista, e não relativista, posicionando-se em função de um projecto mais global de fundamentar na hermenêutica algumas das principais posições da Escola Austríaca de Economia, pelo que o artigo propõe significativas pistas para uma releitura não só da praxeologia de Ludwig von Mises e da ordem espontânea de que fala Friedrich von Hayek, mas também da noção de middle ground proposta por Israel Kirzner e, não menos, de toda a temática relacionada com a empresarialidade. Por outro lado, posicionando-se numa perspectiva de superação da dialéctica entre teoria e história, entre "a priori" e "a posteriori", o artigo representa também uma chamada de atenção para a importância que deveria ter o estudo do pensamento de Edmund Husserl no âmbito das Ciências Sociais. This article aims in the first place at demonstrating how Edmund Husserl's idea of the intersubjective constitution of the life-world represents an appropriate explanation of the principle of subjectivity inherent to the theorizing of the Austrian School of Economics. In order to do this, the author proposes a realistic and non-relativistic view of hermeneutics, whereby his goal is precisely to demonstrate how much the Austrian School of Economics is grounded in hermeneutics. In this sense, the article suggests a new reading of Ludwig von Mises's praxeology, of Friedrich von Hayek's theory of the spontaneous order and a reinterpretation of Israel Kirzner's middle ground position and the corresponding theory of alertness. Positioning itself beyond the discussion between theory and history, or the debate if the prevalence should belong to the "a priori" or to the "a posteriori", the article suggests that Hus~<br>

Abstract: This article addresses the woman teller's identity in the literary fairy tales of France. The author rereads prefaces and images that scholars have used to demonstrate the woman teller's literarity to argue rather for her "frivolity," a word the women themselves use to describe their writing. The essay finds that frivolity is an aesthetic principle at the heart of the women's poetic project that marks their difference from even the Modern partisans of the great literary debate. The principle of frivolity is captured in an image that recurs in prefaces by the writers: the "modern" fairy.<br>

Abstract: In 1884 an Ottoman public prosecutor and fellow officials stood trial for abusing their official authorities when attending to an incident in one of Istanbul's neighborhoods. A published verbatim report of the proceedings is used in this article for discussing Ottoman socio-legal change in the late nineteenth century, employing a microhistorical perspective. Following a major reform in the new court system, which was established in the 1860s (the Nizamiye courts), the judicial authorities used the trial in question for transmitting the commitment of the modernizing state to the rule of law, exhibited by the principle of officials' accountability. Features of the reformed judicial system and its distinctive legal culture are demonstrated in this article by unfolding the judicial aspects of this episode and by discussing connections between them and the immediate socio-political and socio-legal contexts of the trial.<br>

Abstract: Butor's book corresponds to a transitory phase in the history of books, in which appear both a reflection on the nature of the book as object and a desire to introduce "fracture" and "mobility" within narrative. Three aspects are of principle interest: the relationship between the "mobile" text and its medium, the "book" as deconstructed by its writing; the importance of the text's visual aspect in a Mallarmean tradition which also resonates with the work of Calder and Pollock; the displacement of narrative towards litany and spatial forms which undo the usual métonymie links of the text. In toto, the book qua book appears as the locus for a conflict between destruction and re-creation, spatialisation and linearity, order and disorder, which prefigures computer hypertextuality.<br>

Abstract: The principle of hermeneutical interpretation (i.e., the art and discipline of analyzing the symbols of sacred texts) is explained and applied to the analytical group situation. It is maintained that the approach employed by this methodology provides a viable manner for understanding patients' unconscious communications. In particular, the relationship between metaphorical communication and the here-and-now therapeutic experience is discussed. It is argued that the unconscious manifests itself as a set o f metaphorical expressions. The paper presents two clinical vignettes illustrating how this hermeneutical methodology can aid the therapist to "read" the unconscious meanings of such metaphors.<br>

Author(s): Visvanathan Susan<br>
Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: Attempting a Christ-oriented reading of the Old Testament is a challenge which invites objections and obstacles. What is the degree of legitimacy or of necessity which the New Testament (the Gospels and Acts) provides for such a reading? We are concerned with those texts which set forth the principle itself rather than with individual citations; such a reading appears as inseparable from the foundations of the faith. Other texts are illuminating for us with regard to the way of carrying this out. This article presents the first lines of a response, by means of a hermeneutical conversion. It presupposes that one cannot distance oneself from the literal meaning and from its spiritual and theological content.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le Sakuteiki (Notes sur l'arrangement des jardins, XIe siècle) jusqu'aux jardins de daïmyôs de l'époque d'Edo (1603-1867), le jardin japonais est empreint d'une tendance marquée à référer les formes de ses constituants à des sites et à des paysages modèles dénommés « sites de renom » (meisho). Ce système de référence est appelé mitate, ce qui signifie littéralement « instituer par le regard ». Cela se rapporte, d'une part, au principe de la métaphore, et, d'autre part, au dynamisme fondamental des localisations dans l'écoumène, tel que l'illustrent le couple topos/chôra dans le Timée et la distinction que fait Nishida entre logique d'identité du sujet et logique d'identité du prédicat. Fron the Sakuteiki (Notes on the making of gardens, XIth c.) to daimyos gardens of the Edo period (1603-1867), the Japanese gardens display a prominent tendency to refer its material forms to paradigmatic places and landscapes, called « places with a name » (meisho). This system of reference was called mitate, which literaly means « instituting by seeing ». It is here related, on the one hand, to the principle of metaphor, and on the other hand to the fundamental dynamics of place in the ecumene, as illustrated by the couple topos/chôra in the Timaios and by Nishida's dictinstion between a logic of the identity of the subject and a logic of the identity of the predicate (or logic of place).<br>

Date: 10 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Burgan Mary<br>
Abstract: Despite recent critical denigrations of the representation of temporality as a defining interest in narrative, it is important to reappraise the epiphany as a feature of the short stories of "founding" modernist women writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Nevertheless, the association of the epiphanic story with "feminine" writing drove a writer like Doris Lessing to reject the epiphany as an organizing principle in her stories; she chose, instead, the more fabular, allegorical model of a writer like D. H. Lawrence. Finally, however, Lessing, like other women writers of the short story, kept in touch with the intuition of revelation in moments of being whose power act not only as organizers of narrative but also as significations of a kind of feminine sensory apprehension of temporality. This discursive implementation of the moment as the center of modernist women writers' short fiction may be recuperated so as to preserve their achievements from the preference for a decentered écriture féminine.<br>

Abstract: The analysis of an opera, understood as a dramatic text on which a plurality of texts converge, each generated by a different expressive code (be it verbal, musical, or visual), must first of all define a pertinent criterion by which the significant "actions" as discrete semantic units can be located in the text itself. Such a criterion can be identified within the principle at the basis of the dramatic genre, the interaction of the characters acting on stage and their changing relationships. On this basis, it is possible to read the action in Le Nozze di Figaro as the evolving system of dominance relationships between Count Almaviva and Figaro, and the various ways in which the other characters participate in this conflict. The same principle makes it possible to analyze a specific segment of the action (act II, scene VII-VIII, the second main section of the second finale), which can be broken down into a number of semantic units, along two hierarchically-organized structural levels. Earlier analyses have segmented this scene according to purely musical criteria, without considering its meaning for the overall unfolding of the drama. This new reading shows how the scene presents an important turning point in the plot, a temporary reversal of the relationship between the Count and the Countess. This turning point belongs specifically to the plot of the opera, which draws heavily on the text of the Beaumarchais comedy, but reformulates the syntax of the events; this shows how the "meaning" of a scene does not lie in the characters' dialogue alone, but that this is merely one of the possible devices by which the action is made to advance. As far as the role of the musical text is concerned, an analysis of its various components (form, motivic materials, tonal relationships, etc.) in the scene under consideration reveals that its role is primarily one of demarcation (it helps one to perceive the unity of a specific set of actions and its difference from the next set) a~<br>

Abstract: Épictète, rapportant l'argument dominateur, dit que Cléanthe en a contesté la seconde prémisse, à savoir que le passé est nécessaire. On expose pour les rejeter deux conjectures qui donnent une interprétation « logique » de cette solution. La première voit en Cléanthe l'ancêtre d'Ockham : il aurait contesté la nécessité non du passé, mais des propositions ayant la forme du passé sans porter sur le passé. Solution insuffisante si le dominateur n'est pas ambigu. Pour la rendre acceptable, il faudrait avec Jean Duns Scot, contester le principe de nécessité conditionnelle. Mais on quitte alors Cléanthe. La seconde conjecture, due à Leibniz, ne prête au passé qu'une nécessité conditionnelle de même type que celle du présent et du futur. Mais comment décrire alors la modalité propre au passé ? La conjecture qu'on proposera est d'ordre « physique ». Elle tire, pour la modalité du passé, les conséquences de l'éternel retour et du caractère cyclique du temps. Cleanthes solved the Master Argument by denying that the past if true is necessary. According to a first interpretation sentences, though in past tense, may be about future events. This solution, in the style of Ockham, supposes the Master Argument to be ambiguous. It is shown, however, that once the ambiguity is dispelled, the argument loses its validity only if the principle of conditional necessity is questioned, as it has been by Duns Scot ; but this has nothing to do with the « necessity » of the past. A second interpretation, given by Leibniz, identifies the necessity of the past with conditional necessity, but ignores the specific role of past in the argument. A third interpretation will be proposed which falls within the province of physics rather than of logic : past has no distinguished status because time is cyclic.<br>

Abstract: L'épistémologie d'Émile Meyerson vise à expliquer le réalisme spontané des physiciens en termes anthropologiques. À cette fin, le philosophe met à contribution les ressources des sciences humaines naissantes. Cependant, nous montrons qu'une telle philosophie des sciences y gagnerait à considérer d'autres aspects de l'expérience psychologique et sociale. Eugène Minkowski Arnaud Dandieu et Jacques Lacan — qui se réclament tous des travaux de Meyerson — nous permettent de percevoir une dimension insoupçonnée du principe épistémo logique d'identité, car l'identification des objets, décrite avec tant de précision par Meyerson, est toujours compliquée par l'identification du sujet de la science avec d'autres sujets au sein d'une culture donnée. Emile Meyerson's epistemology aims at explaining the spontaneous physicists' realism in anthropological terms. Consequently, the philosopher uses the resources of the newly born human sciences. Yet, we argue that such a philosophy of sciences would gain at considering other aspects of social and psychological experience. Eugène Minkowski, Arnaud Dandieu et Jacques Lacan — all indebted with Meyerson's work — enable us to perceive an unseen dimension of the epistemological principle of identity : for the identification of objects, so precisely described by Meyerson, is always complicated by the identification of the subject of science with other subjects inside a peculiar culture.<br>

Abstract: On associe généralement la figure de Satan à une signification indigente ou mesquine. Dans la Philosophie de la révélation, Schelling tente au contraire d'en donner une interprétation différente, selon laquelle la « mauvaiseté positive » de Satan n'est pas seulement assumée, mais également revalorisée. Cependant, le rôle de Satan demeure ambigu, incarnant à la fois le tentateur universel et le maillon nécessaire à la révélation de Dieu lui-même. Dans cette étude, il s'agit donc de montrer à la fois la nature amphibolique du Diable, et de rendre compte des multiples endossements qu'il recouvre. Une tâche qui implique précisément la mise en évidence du rôle incontournable de Satan dans la victoire finale du bien, et qui se manifeste, en termes schellingiens, par l'incompatibilité de l'homme avec le feu dévorant du principe de lumière, laquelle nécessite un principe obscur qui hâte la séparation, pressent le mal et le provoque. One usually associates the figure of Satan with an impoverished, insufficient signification. On the contrary, in the Philosophy of Revelation Schelling tries to give a different interpretation, according to which Satan's potential for evil is not only accepted but embraced and given a positive valence, postulating a sort of "positivity of evil". However, Satan's role remains ambiguous, since he represents both the universal tempter and a necessary link in the process that reveals God's presence in the world. In this paper, I want to emphasize the Devil's twofold nature and to explore his multiple forms. This highlights Satan's necessary role in the final triumph of good, and how this role appears, in Schellingian terms, through the human inability to sound the depths of the consuming fire of divine light, which necessitates the existence of a dark principle that entails a separation, foreknows evil and thereby creates it.<br>

Abstract: An investigation into poets' creative use of the Christian Bible reveals that receptions of the Bible as an imaginative text play an important role in what is achieved in such poems. The article will deal with a coherent group of poems by Antjie Krog, Die Jerusalemgangers, in a volume titled Jerusalemgangers (1985). It consists of eight different poems grouped into three sections. Voices from many centuries echo in these poems. The central theme is developed through four main perspectives, namely a male leader, a 'black consciousness' voice, a woman visionary and the all-embracing and composing perspective of the poet as visionary which incorporates the perspectives of other South African literary voices. This central theme concerns the universal quest for a Utopia, in these poems with their religiously conscious speakers, Utopia is presented in the Biblical imagery of a new Jerusalem. The creative process is activated as each voice, in its pursuit of an imaginary ideal context, uses the same text as a guiding principle on its 'journey' towards 'liberation'. The poet juxtaposes ideological readings of the Christian Bible, directed by different experiences of the South African context. The poet's vision clearly becomes a voice among others and yet it functions as a composing factor. This leads to commenting secular texts entering into the discourse. In the poetic text structuring and linguistic principles can lead to aesthetic insights into ostensibly unreconciled elements. The reading of the poems presented in this article will be directed by such poetic conventions. An attempt will be made to identify the signifying role of the poet's response to the Biblical imagery. The reader's response to these poems is likewise influenced by an acquaintance with the Bible.<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: Laying down as a theorical narratologic principle that history has never taken the shape of an actual experience, but was untili today a mere narrative representation, the author aims at following the evolution of the relation between literary shapes and historical past in the Polish literature after the Second World War. From 1945 onwards history does not appear any more as a kind of strategical staging; instead it becomes an attempt to live an immediate experience regardless of any intellectual reconstruction. Otherwise, instrumentalisation and ideological recovery of the past lead the Polish writers to a real denial of history thanks to (self) parodical literary forms. Finally the multiplication of autobiographical works means a new attack against the traditional historical novel. Thus, thanks to this triple strategy which leads to a dismantling of history consistent with the now prevailing bursting of narrative forms, Polish literature brings its own answer to the history crisis which is to be seen nowadays in the western literature.<br>

Abstract: La revue Christianisme social (1896-1971) était l'organe de la Fédération française du Christianisme social, mouvement protestant d'action sociale orienté vers un socialisme chrétien. De 1954 à 1962, elle a vigoureusement pris parti contre la poursuite de la guerre d'Algérie et pour le rétablissement de la paix au moyen d'une négociation avec le F.L.N. Elle a joué le rôle d'une avant-garde par rapport à l'opinion publique protestante, mais sans oser se transformer en parti de la gauche protestante afin de sauvegarder son unité. Son engagement combinait des motivations fondamentalement morales et spirituelles (refus de la torture pratiquée par la police et l'armée françaises) et une analyse politique attribuant au colonialisme français la responsabilité du conflit. Rejetant le principe révolutionnaire du « la fin justifie les moyens », ses rédacteurs appartenaient aux catégories d'opposants à la guerre que Pierre Vidal-Naquet a qualifiés de « dreyfusards » et de « tiers-mondistes ». Mais une étude historique rétrospective doit constater que l'objectivité de leur vision de la guerre d'Algérie a été en partie biaisée par leur parti-pris. Christianisme social (1896-1971) was the main press organ for the Fédération française du Christianisme social, a protestant social action movement leaning toward Christian socialism. From 1954 to 1962, this magazine strongly condemned the pursuit of the Algerian war and called for establishing peace by negociating with the F.L.N. It played an avant garde role for Protestant public opinion without daring setting itself up as the Protestant left party in order to maintain its' unity. This magazines mission combined basically moral and spiritual motivations (refusing torture practised by the French police and army) and a political analysis placing responsability for the conflict on French colonialism. Having rejected the revolutionary principle "The end justifies the means", its' writers belonged to the war opponents that Pierre Vidal-Na~<br>

Abstract: Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.<br>

Abstract: L'article est une recension très développée du dernier livre de J. A. T. Robinson, The Priority of John (Londres, 1985). Il faut distinguer plusieurs aspects dans la thèse de Robinson. Pour la date de l'édition finale de Jean, il vaut mieux retenir les données de la tradition patristique que la critique interne vient confirmer, quoi qu'en dise R. : le recenseur fait la contre-épreuve de son argumentation. L'examen interne de l'évangile laisse à bon droit les critiques hésitant sur l'identité du « disciple que Jésus aimait ». La chronologie de la vie publique a été étudiée par R. avec soin et on peut le suivre dans la plupart des cas ; mais il n'est pas le premier qui donne à Jean une telle préférence sur ce point. On peut être plus hésitant devant sa reconstruction de la « vie de Jésus », dans la mesure où il lui manque une analyse méthologique sérieuse au sujet de la notion d'­« historicité » ; il tend trop à étendre celle-ci aux détails des récits et des paroles de Jésus. Il nuance en principe la « littéralité » de ces paroles dans la catéchèse de Jean ; mais en pratique il a toujours tendance à l'étendre outre-mesure, sans tenir assez compte de leur « relecture » dans la lumière de la Résurrection et en fonction de l'expérience de l'Église. This article is an extended review of J. A. T. Robinsons's last book, The Priority of John (London, 1985). Although Robinson holds for an early date of the final edition of John, the reviewer argues to the contrary, viz., that it is better to retain the patristic tradition of a late date and that internal criticism supports this tradition. Critics are understandably puzzled over the identity of the "disciple whom Jesus loved". The chronology of the public life of Jesus has been carefully studied by R. and one can follow him most of the time, but he is not the first to prefer John on this point. But one hesitates before his reconstruction of the "life of Jesus", since he lacks a methodologically serious analysis of the notion "~<br>

Abstract: Cet article se propose de lire l'Ancien Testament comme littérature de crise à partir d'un paradigme fourni par la sociologie moderne. Trois attitudes principales caractérisent les réactions intellectuelles face à la situation de crise: l'attitude «utopique», l'attitude «nostalgique» et l'attitude «scientifique». Ces trois attitudes permettent de décrire les grands courants idéologiques du peuple hébreu face au drame national de l'exil babylonien. Pour les prophètes, l'exil apparaît comme un temps intermédiaire annonçant une ère de salut. Les milieux sacerdotaux présentent le retour aux institutions religieuses passées comme la seule solution à la crise. Les intellectuels de l'école deutéronomiste cherchent à comprendre les raisons du drame de l'exil sans immédiatement proposer de solutions pour le futur. La société juive de l'époque exilique, puis post-exilique est caractérisée par la cohabitation et le dialogue de ces différentes perspectives. Cette cohabitation peut être proposée comme paradigme pour une approche de la crise en société moderne. This article proposes the reading of the Old Testament as crisis literature according to a paradigm of modern sociology. Three principle attitudes typify intellectual reactions to crisis: the "utopic", the "nostalgic" and the "scientific". These can help us describe the main ideological currents of the Hebrew nation faced with the drama of the Babylonian exile. For the prophets, the exile is an interim announcing a time of salvation. For the priestly circle, the return to former religious institutions is the only solution to the crisis. The intellectual Deuteronomists seek to understand the reasons for the tragedy of the exile without proposing immediate solutions. Jewish society at the time of the exile and after it is distinguished by the cohabitation and dialogue between these different perspectives. This cohabitation may serve as a paradigm for an approach to crises in modern society.<br>

Abstract: En se servant de la métaphore comme fil conducteur, le présent article ambitionne d'explorer l'un ou l'autre rapport que l'on peut déceler entre le discours de la science et celui du philosophe. Mais au lieu d'opérer empiriquement, l'analyse s'efforce de se situer sur un plan méta-conceptuel. Pour cela, elle se fonde sur une présentation des deux perspectives théoriques essentielles suivant lesquelles est conçue la métaphore : la perspective extensionnelle et la perspective intensionnelle. Alors que l'usage conventionnel et référentiel de la métaphore s'accorde avec la première perspective, l'usage innovant s'accorde plutôt avec la seconde. Envisagée comme une connaissance sans objet, la philosophie s'accommode parfaitement du modèle intensionnel de la métaphore. Celui-ci rend compte, en effet, non seulement des métaphores avérées mais aussi des concepts philosophiques eux-mêmes. En revanche, le modèle extensionnel convient apparemment mieux au discours scientifique qui porte en principe sur un objet. Il soulève néanmoins des difficultés importantes qui conduisent à réviser une approche par trop rationnelle de la science. Taking the metaphor as a vital lead, this article explores the various links between scientific and philosophical discourse. But rather than be empirical, this analysis is situated on a meta-conceptual level. As such, it offers two essential theoretical perspectives of the metaphor : the extensional and the intensional. While the usual and referential convention of the metaphor agrees with the first perspective, innovative use agrees rather with the second. As non-objective knowledge, philosophy perfectly accommodates the intensional model of metaphor, which, in effect, takes into account not only proven metaphors but also philosophcial concepts themselves. On the other hand, the extensional model is better suited to scientific discourse, which, in principle, is objective. The article nevertheless points out important difficulties that call for a r~<br>

Abstract: Nous montrons ici que le rejet de l'identité par Wittgenstein s'appuie sur la contestation du principe de causalité, doublé d'une conception pragmatique de la personne. Dans son rejet de la causalité la position de Wittgenstein ressemble fortement à celle de David Hume. Pour parvenir à une conception pragmatique de la personne on analysera l'usage linguistique et grammatical qui régit l'identité personnelle. Chez Wittgenstein le concept de personne se définit par rapport au contexte actionnel. Here we show that Wittgentstein's dismissal of identity is dependent on the disputing of the principle of causality, reinforced by a pragmatic concept of personhood. In his rejection of causality, the position of Wittgenstein resembles that of David Hume. In order to get to a pragmatic idea of personhood, linguistic and grammatical usage of the terms defining personal identity is analysed. For Wittgenstein, the idea of personhood is defined in relation to the actual context.<br>

Abstract: L'article étudie les modifications successives et conjointes des arguments de convenance et des structures du traité de l'Incarnation au long de l'itinéraire de S. Thomas. Il se propose de contester l'habitude de réduire la place du Christ dans la Somme Théologique à la simple causalité rédemptrice. Une lecture attentive de la première question de la Tertia pars de la Somme Théologique établit que l'opposition habituelle entre Incarnation et Rédemption se trouve dépassée dans la découverte du mystère pascal de Jésus comme la manifestation et la réalité de Dieu toujours plus grand. La Christologie est alors tout autre chose qu'un appendice : la consummatio totius theologici negotii, clef de voûte et principe de toute la théologie. The article studies the successive and conjunct modifications of the arguments of convenance and the structures the treatise on the Incarnation throughout St. Thomas' itinerary. It is proposed to contest the habit of reducing the place of Christ in the Summa Theologica to a simple redemptive causality. An attentive reading of the first question of the Tertia Pars of the Summa Theologica establishes that the habitual opposition between Incarnation and Redemption is found to be surpassed in the discovery of the Pascal Mystery of Jesus as the manifestation and reality of the always greater God. The Christology is then quite other than a mere appendix: the consummatio totius theologici negotii, keystone and principle of all theology.<br>

Issue: i40184957<br>

Author(s): De Bauw Christine<br>
Abstract: L'œuvre de P. Ricœur laisse envisager une articulation spécifique entre la structure métaphysique de l'existence, caractérisée comme réflexion décentrée, et le mode propre selon lequel le religieux fait sens. En son principe, le religieux est coextensif au mouvement même de la réflexion, dont l'herméneutique constitue à la fois la vérité et la méthode: tension temporelle du soi entre son acte propre et les signes qu'il produit (Nabert), au sein du sens qui le précède. Sans jamais combler spéculativement la faille entre le soi et l'absolu, le religieux présente à l'imagination (au sens kantien) le scheme de l'accomplissement de l'existence. The work of P. Ricœur allows one to envisage the possibility of a specific link between the metaphysical nature of existence, depicted as eccentric reflection, and the standart view which gives religion its direction. In its principle, the 'religious' factor is co-extensive with the flow of reflection, whose hermeneutic constitutes not only the truth, but also the method: a temporal tension in the Self as between one's own actions and the effects they produce (J. Nabert), in the context of the intention which precedes them. While never spcculativcly overloading the fissure between the Self and the Absolute, religiosity affords to the imagination (in the sense used by Kant) a pattern for the fulfilment of existence.<br>

Article Title: A Copper Rule versus the Golden Rule: A Daoist-Confucian Proposal for Global Ethics<br>
Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
Issue: i405203<br>
Date: 7 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Wattles Yong<br>
Abstract: Here a moral principle called the "Copper Rule" is developed and defended as an alternative to the Golden Rule. First, the article focuses on two problems with the Golden Rule's traditional formulation of "Do (or don't do) unto others what you would (or would not) have them do unto you": it assumes (1) the uniformity of human needs and preferences and (2) that whatever is universally desired is good. Second, it examines three attempts to reformulate the Golden Rule-Marcus Singer's general interpretation, Allan Gewirth's rationalization, and R. M. Hare's imaginative role reversal-to show why they all fail to save the Golden Rule from difficulty. Third, the rich resources of the Chinese Confucian-Daoist philosophical traditions are appropriated to develop a "Copper Rule" as an alternative moral principle: "Do (or don't do) unto others as they would (or would not) have us do unto them." This moral principle not only avoids the two problems, but also has additional advantages. Finally, the "Copper Rule" is defended against three objections or counterarguments: what if people ask you (for example) (1) to kill someone else, (2) to kill them, or (3) to kill yourself? The appropriate response is merely to trace the implications of the "Copper Rule" rather than add any ad hoc arguments.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219828<br>
Date: 10 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Watkins John<br>
Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: Lévi-Strauss claims that the unconscious activity of mind is more important than the conscious one for understanding social phenomena and that the unconscious consists of an aggregate of forms, which are imposed on psychological and physical content. The real inspiration of Lévi-Strauss' notion is the Kantian notion of mental constraints and the postulate of isomorphism of mental and physical laws. The methodological usefulness of the unconscious as a principle of intelligibility is placed in evidence.<br>

Abstract: Van Roermund also rejects MacCormick's distinction between normative and
narrative coherence, an sees narrative coherence as the very principle of the relation
between facts and norms (case and decision), thereby relying on philosophical argu-
ments. Two citations are too nice to be left unquoted. 'Facts are, as Strawson put it
(1964), what statements, when true, state; they are not what statements are about...
i.e., they are not things or states or events, but the objectifiable contents of state-
ments'. 'This definition of"a fact" resembles...Goodman's famous phrase: "Facts are
little theories; and true theories are big facts"' (1988, at 160)

Abstract: Recently, abolitionists have turned to what they say is their most powerful argument against the death penalty, namely, the execution of an innocent man, Troy Davis, in Georgia in September 2011. Davis was found guilty of killing a police officer while attempting to escape the scene of a robbery. The argument that the criminal justice system can make mistakes, however, is not an argument against the
      principleof the death penalty. Neither is the argument that lethal injection is cruel and unusual. Rather, these arguments allow that although the practice is flawed, the principle may be sound; if only we improve and perfect the practice, then we authorize the principle. The fantasy of humane painless instant death, technologically administered, contributes not only to the idea of the perfection of the means of death in order to justify the principle of the death penalty but also to the fantasy of death itself as anabsolute, in this case, the absolute end of suffering and pain.<br>

Abstract: Of course, it is obvious that we come to know “persons” (or “personal I's”) by a process of comparison, that is, we understand persons not merely as what “I” refers to but as what I's have, what Husserl would call their “habitualities.” That is, we refer to them as beings in the world with others. In this respect knowing persons is indeed a matter of an identification of someone by
            per accidens individuation. The distinguishing properties that single me out for myself and for you in terms of bodily shape, species or kind, face, psychical and moral traits, gender, profession, autobiography, ethnicity, nationality, locality, place in time, and so on and so forth are a matter of individuationper accidensor of relating me or the other person to what is other than me or other than she or he. Yet, if we may consider the hypothesis that there is a sense in which what “I” refers to is not a mere bundle or constellation of properties (which in principle is repeatable), we may entertain a sense in which what/whom “I” refers to is nonsortal—nonpropertied—and this may give us reason to pause in thinking ofpersonsimply as a sortal term.<br>

Abstract: More manageable, but not less important, is the role of Emmanuel Levinas. We can compare his contribution to normative ethics to that of Kant. Like Kant, he offers an account of the moral life in terms of unconditional (categorical), infinite (never finished, imperfect) obligation. His is a deontological theory. Like Kant, he seeks to articulate the first principle of moral obligation and offers three formulations of it (paralleling a familiar reading of Kant). You shall not commit murder.
            
                  You shall not let me die alone.4
               
                  You shall not usurp my place in the sun.5
               
                  That the second and third formulas specify imperfect duties should be abundantly clear.6<br>

Article Title: Dilemmas and Delusions<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Wixson Christopher<br>
Abstract: Along the same lines, in the preface to
      Man and Superman, he draws a distinction between two states of corporeal infirmity. The first, what he calls “the true joy of life,” results from “the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap, the being a force of nature.” The second is engendered by a failure of will and perspective, producing “a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.”
            Scholars and biographers have taken both views of Shaw. Countless testimonies of friends and acquaintances as well as innumerable pronouncements by GBS himself laud the extraordinary vibrancy of the “active young revolutionist” following his typical schedule of prolific writing and speech giving.22
         
            At the same time, Shaw's private diaries are replete with meticulous physiological self-examination, documenting his crippling headaches as well as myriad illnesses, injuries, changes in weight and appetite, and suspected symptoms. Robert Brustein attributes “a kind of Swiftian disgust at the human body and its functions” to the playwright, while Sally Peters pathologizes his interest in health, arguing its origin in latent psychosis, specifically an obsessive fear of contagion.23
         
            His commitment to vegetarianism, teetotalism, and Jaegerism, she argues, was founded as much upon hygienic paranoia as moral principle: “Fueled by a “desperate revulsion from body and biology[,] … Shaw's was an ever-lasting defense against dirt, poison, and contamination[,] whatever symbolized to him the form-destroying potencies of existence.”24
         
            In any case, the vexed body, on its way to evolutionary elimination, assiduously preoccupied Shaw, and matters of personal and public wellness remained an idée fixe until the end of his life.25<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Like Ricoeur, Shaw invests his ethical capital in enhancing life, not in obeying rules. In the celebrated dream sequence of
         Man and Superman, Shaw includes duty as one of the seven deadly virtues that cause more detriment than benefit. For him, there is no act, however heinous, that some well-intentioned individual has not justified under the rubric of duty. The road to hell, Shaw said famously, is paved with the good intentions of those who in the aftermath of disastrous results defended themselves by claiming that duty compelled them to do what they did. For this reason, his recording angel is not keenly interested in what Kantian precepts individuals have or have not followed. What counts for the celestial Shavian bookkeeper is whether actions make the world better or worse, whether they reduce suffering and increase happiness—with happiness defined as the joy, the wellness, that comes from serving a purpose greater than narrow self-interest. “[C]onduct,” Shaw writes, “must justify itself by its effect upon life and not by its conformity to any rule or ideal.”
               And effecting life, in the sense Shaw understands it, is not a matter of dutifully genuflecting before conventional morality but of asserting the autonomous will, even if it engenders charges of immorality. “[L]ife,” he continues, “consists in the fulfilment of will”33
            
               and not in, as he reiterates in34
            The Sanity of Art, “the fulfilment of a moral law or of the deductions of reason.”
               Even so, Shaw makes it very clear that in crowning the will sovereign he is not championing anarchy. For every sanctioned principle his visionaries disavow, they honor nine. Shaw does not condone recklessness or wild abandon. Before the will sets events in motion, prudence and deliberative judgment, he believes, should prepare the way. He is well aware that we cannot dispense with tradition entirely and reasonably expect society to remain stable. Rat~<br>

Abstract: Marcuse's attitudes about utopia changed over the course of his career, and he remained ambivalent about the chance of realizing a utopian society. At the beginning of his career, his book
         Eros and Civilization(1955) defined utopia as the classic notion of an unachievable but desirable no-place outside of history, but by the end of his career, in his last book,The Aesthetic Dimension(1978), he had somewhat accepted Bloch's idea of the socialist “concrete utopia.” The emphases on quality and eros turn Marcuse's theory toward aesthetics, and as a result he favors arts and letters as vehicles for social change in the process of educating human desire. Clearly these are areas that touch on the function of rhetoric as well. Utopia for Marcuse is seen in relation to the progress of social change, and art's role is to keep alive the possibility of social and cultural transformation—the idea of utopia as a possible aim.
               In this way he resembles Bloch; both of them have a rhetorical role for utopian art and mediated productions of all kinds. However, Marcuse's utopia differs from Bloch's in that the present and the future are greatly separated, instead of one continually emerging from the other in an unfolding process. Utopia is a kind of natural, interpersonal eros that could sprout from the ashes of a formerly repressed society—something more chiastic than progressive, to use Mannheim's terms. In the meantime, false needs, such as those evoked through advertising, must be exposed, and true needs should be cultivated in their place. The work ethic would be replaced by a principle of receptivity and nonviolence (i.e., eros), and the highest value would be sufficiency rather than superabundance.28

Abstract: Joyce's vision of the world is based not upon certain faith but upon what Jean-Michel Rabaté has described as “the relativity of doubt”—“doubt oddly appears as the only firm ground on which the edifice of the work steadies and secures itself.”
         
               Indeed, doubt, according to Rabaté, “offers a key … because of the great suspension it affords, to the essence of Life.”108
            
               This sense of doubt is therefore not only deconstructive: it is both substantive and constructive. Irony and uncertainty are tonally and philosophically central to Joyce's work: this is what Herring dubbed109
            Joyce's Uncertainty Principle. His world is a pluralist, shifting, and ambiguous space—yet (orbecause) it remains an irreducibly real, historical, and material space, one that challenges its own idealization. It is the creation of an author who denied his own artistic apotheosis, an echo of the similarly discordant literary, political, and religious canonization of Thomas More. It is, after all, the work of a writer who argued that “a man is a martyr only for things of which he is not quite sure.”
               Insofar as the certainty of salvation might negate its weight of sacrifice, Jesus's death, for example, is therefore valorized, in Matthew 27:46, by his loss of absolute faith: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” It is a similar rejection of total dependence upon external forces, be they divine or historical, that heroically shifts the Homeric epic toward Joycean humanism.110<br>
