  Topical Invention and Metaphoric Interaction from:

  Abstract: In the course of his analysis of traditional principles of rhetoric, Kenneth Burke makes the curious remark that “the Aristotelian topics shift so imperceptibly between ideas and images that you wonder how the two realms could ever come to be at odds.”¹ The remark is curious, perhaps even subversive, since it associates two domains that both ancient and modern theorists generally have kept apart. In classical rhetoric, of course, images belong to the office of style and function to ornament the language of oratory. Topics, on the other hand, refer to matters of thought and to the office of invention.<br>

  Abstract: When I first began to study rhetoric, some forty or so years ago, the terms “substance” and “theory” occupied privileged positions in disciplinary consciousness. “Substance” referred to content or subject matter, and in this pre-postdisciplinary scheme of things, scholars were supposed to work within bounded and clearly differentiated domains of inquiry. A discipline, that is, needed to have a proper subject, and since scholarship demanded rationally refined, systematically organized abstract principles that stood above and apart from particulars, the study of an academic subject required the use of “theory.” In the quasi discipline then known as speech (

  9  Symbolic Stagnation and Ideological Calcification in Israel from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The roughly fifteen-year period from Begin’s resignation as prime minister to the election of Benjamin Netanyahu can best be understood as a period of symbolic stagnation. The symbolic equation that had been established in the late 1970s and early 1980s remained firmly in place. Labor’s perspective, especially as enunciated by Shimon Peres, reduced itself to ungrounded pragmatism, what might be called a “Let’s Make a Deal” approach, in which there was no firm ideological principle to guide action. The absence of a grounded perspective on security created a symbolic weakness that became especially obvious in the aftermath of terrorist incidents.<br>

  Abstract: The founder of ʺstructural anthropologyʺ Lévi-Strauss globalizes Durkheimʹs ʺcollective mindʺ and here carries it into the heart of the city—the contemporary world of the new wilderness. Beneath the primitive-civilized dichotomy, he asserts a deep structure, a principle of psychic unity that offers a way out of the anomie caused not only by a breakdown of the social bond but by rejection of the underlying unity of mind and nature. The resultant proposition is a new science—based like that of Vico (see above, p. 4) on the reshaping of a primary ʺpoetic wisdomʺ—and a recognition of the actual<br>

  CHAPTER 4  “The Shortcomings of Timetables”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7rg">The Cosmic Time of Empire</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 3 I described how Bram Stoker’s
                  Draculaenlisted global standard time both at the level of plot, with Mina Harker’s and the Count’s competing mastery of timetables, and also as a principle of narrative structure, with discrepant time lines from various media synchronized into a uniform typewritten narrative. For Stoker standard time served a double function: it preserved England’s ontological purity by excising the temporally untranslatable, and it provided a model for a total narrative, able to assimilate various classes, nations, and dialects (spoken by the multinational vampire hunters) as well as various media. Modernist texts attack standard<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: Interpreting Musicis a comprehensive essay on understanding musical meaning and performing music meaningfully-"interpreting music" in both senses of the term. Synthesizing and advancing two decades of highly influential work, Lawrence Kramer fundamentally rethinks the concepts of work, score, performance, performativity, interpretation, and meaning-even the very concept of music-while breaking down conventional wisdom and received ideas. Kramer argues that music, far from being closed to interpretation, is ideally open to it, and that musical interpretation is the paradigm of interpretation in general. The book illustrates the many dimensions of interpreting music through a series of case studies drawn from the classical repertoire, but its methods and principles carry over to other repertoires just as they carry beyond music by workingthroughmusic to wider philosophical and cultural questions.<br>

  Author(s) KELLER EVELYN FOX<br>
  Abstract: If cultural studies have a core principle, it is a negative one: against universality, against any and all suppositions of a ″human nature,″ physical or behavioral. From cultural studies, we learn both of the diversity of bodies and of their manifest cultural malleability. As Elizabeth Grosz says, bodies are ″male or female, black, brown, white, large or small … not as entities in themselves or simply on a linear continuum with its polar extremes occupied by male and female bodies … but as a field, a 2-D continuum in which race (and possibly even class, caste or religion) form body<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp5kk">A Usable Past</a><br>
  Abstract: Renaissance Florence has long been considered the origin in European history of a concern with politics as an autonomous study. Faced with the problems of governing a turbulent but independent republic, anxious to insure her survival in a precarious world that seemed to be ruled only by power, and nourished by the rediscovered political culture of antiquity, thoughtful Florentines, in a process that reached a climax with Machiavclli and Guicciardini, began to articulate realistic principles of political effectiveness and to define its limits. In this sense Florence contributed to the education of modern Europe as a congeries of particular powers,<br>

  Abstract: We have come a long way since Bury informed us so firmly that history is a science, no more and no less. Historiography has now become so various and eclectic that it is often difficult to see it as the expression of any specific discipline; historians today seem to be united only by some common concern with the past and by a common allegiance, at least in principle, to respect for evidence, the exercise of critical intelligence, and openness of mind. They differ, on the whole amicably, about the questions they ask; and in answering these questions they draw freely<br>

  Author(s) BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: My purpose in what follows is to take up the relation of hermeneutics and ethics as it emerges in a post-Heideggerian philosophical context. In terms of proper names this means giving an account of the conceptual symmetries and differences between Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics and Emmanuel Levinas’s ethical theory, which is sometimes called an ethics of alterity or of responsibility, in order to contrast it with subject-centered theories that emphasize thinking and acting in accord with rules, principles, duties, codes, beliefs, teachings, communities, theories of the right and the good, and so on, where to be in accord with such things,<br>

  Abstract: The contemporary Western philosophical scene can be characterized in terms of divisions and interactions between approaches to philosophy which assume that their task is inextricably linked to the development of the natural sciences and approaches which often regard this assumption with considerable suspicion. Philosophers who adopt the former approach have the obvious advantage that the project of which they see themselves as a part produces more and more results which are in principle—if not in practice—publicly testable and which appear to confirm their underlying assumption that science is converging towards an already constituted reality as it is “in<br>

What he meant by the “thing” was poetic matter that lives mostly in one’s imagination—an image.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppx1q">Fighting Words</a><br>
  Author(s) Lawson Todd<br>
  Abstract: In the Baha’i tradition, nonviolence is not a principle derived primarily through exegesis but one given through revelation, to use the Baha’i technical term for its primary scripture. There can be no dispute or discussion on this point by either a follower of the Baha’i faith or those who study and understand this relatively recent religion. What may be a source of discussion is the question of how in the context of the history of religion and religions and especially the history of the Baha’i faith this came to be. Here I will first offer a brief discussion of the<br>

  12  Entropy and osmosis in conceptualisations of the Surrealist frame from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.20851/j.ctt1t304z1">Framing French Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) James Klem<br>
  Abstract: Since its inception, Surrealism has been associated with conservative art forms aspiring to a higher synthetic unity, unlike those modern art movements such as Pop Art or installation art, which have eschewed aesthetic and transcendental values in favour of the purely material and commercial. In
                  Displaying the marvellous, Lewis Kachur writes that Breton was 'holding fast to Surrealism as "high" art'.¹ According to Hal Foster, 'reconciliation is theraison d'êtreof Bretonian Surrealism'², whereby the binding or 'synthetic principle'³ underlying Surrealist works is Eros and 'the uncanny is recoded as the marvellous and arrested animation is sublimated as convulsive beauty'.⁴<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Abstract: “Just as we reject the principle of divorcing faith and works, so we reject the principle and the practice of divorcing the life of faith and the life of study,” wrote Father Leo Ward of the University of Notre Dame in 1961.¹ Describing the ideal for the Catholic school, Ward’s rejection invites reflection on Catholic intellectual life. However, this comment, which might galvanize Catholic professors who perceive themselves as exemplars of the ideal, might also solicit quite a different reaction from those outside the professionally academic arena. The public perception of Catholicism does not always incline toward a scholastic tradition.<br>

  Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion’s philosophical project is largely about being true to phenomenology’s supreme principle—the principle that every originary intuition is a legitimizing source of cognition, that everything originarily offered in intuition be accepted as it presents itself.¹ It is by interrogating this “principle of principles,” by unfolding its full consequences, that Marion can posit his “third reduction”—beyond both Husserl and Heidegger—and so unveil the primacy of sheer givenness. In doing so, Marion would claim, any autarchic subjectivity (whether transcendental or existential) is dethroned and dismantled in one and the same act that givenness (

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Author(s) Pratt Scott L.<br>
  Abstract: In
                  The Wretched of the Earth, Frantz Fanon describes the state of oppression in a colonized land as one “obedient to the rules of pure Aristotelian logic.” Here the natives—the original people of the land—and the settlers—the colonizers who now control the land—“follow the principle of reciprocal exclusivity. No conciliation is possible” because the exclusion affirms the settlers and rejects the natives (Fanon,Wretched, 38–39). “At times,” he says, “this Manichaeism goes to its logical conclusion and dehumanizes the native, or to speak plainly, it turns him into an animal” (42).

  Abstract: In many ways Chinese and Western philosophy offer a series of vivid contrasts going all the way back to their respective origins, so that the very idea of philosophy itself stands in contrast. The West begins with the Greeks and their speculative wonder at nature. The original question for them is: What is the originating principle of nature? This prefigures the central concern of Western philosophy with knowledge and science. The origin of Chinese philosophy focuses upon fundamental questions of political and ethical philosophy. The original question for them is, How can we discovery the Way? These two different origins<br>

  Abstract: According to Aristotle’s
                  Metaphysics, the most distinctly unfunny thing about philosophy is the principle of noncontradiction. Indeed, we are encouraged as philosophers to respect this most serious and fundamental principle, namely, that “the same thing cannot at the same time and in the same respect both belong and not belong to the same object.”¹ Aristotle certainly refuses to take the matter lightly, providing eight different proofs and maintaining that the principle holds as a law with absolute psychological as well as ontological governance.

  Abstract: Throughout his oeuvre, Kant focuses on the uncertain relations between universal principles and singular events that threaten to confound the elaboration of a comprehensive model of the mind. One of the central concepts in his account of the (dis)equilibrium of the self is interest, a term that appears at crucial moments in the three
                  Critiques, but whose very ubiquity has tended to divert attention from its importance. “All my reason’s interest (speculative as well as practical),” explains Kant in theCritique of Pure Reason, “is united in the following three questions: What can I know? What ought I to do?<br>

  Abstract: A minimum standard of justice would seem to require that all U.S. children have equal access to U.S. educational institutions, and that any school admissions policy that would exclude a candidate on the basis of race or ethnicity is in clear violation of this principle. Such a basic standard has certainly been upheld by the judgment of the Supreme Court in lawsuits where it was contravened. But I want to argue that the Court in coming to such a decision not only might be failing to serve justice, but in fact would be compounding a grave injustice—at least in<br>

Above all, numerous Protestant Christians and Ch’ŏndogyo believers became forceful advocates of building a new nation and protecting the country from foreign aggressors through the modernization of Korea based on the principles of civilization and enlightenment. Despite the crackdown on nationalist movements after Japan formally colonized Korea in 1910, many Protestant Christian and Ch’ŏndogyo believers secretly continued their nationalist endeavors.

Sekiya Teizaburo, the education director in the colonial government, declared that “the fundamental principle of Korean education, stated in a word, is to bring up the Koreans as citizens or subjects of the Japa nese empire. . . .

If it is not, that is, if the terms and conditions of evolutionary change have themselves changed in the cultural domain, what power of agency or self-determination, if any, do we gain? Can we understand those mechanisms of change better, control<br>

  10  Interpreting with Pragmatist Intentions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bs87q">Intention Interpretation</a><br>
  Author(s) SHUSTERMAN RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: At least three different and influential theories of interpretation claim to be pragmatist. Knapp and Michaels’s theory is rigidly intentionalistic and author bound, while Richard Rorty’s contrastingly emphasizes the production of nonauthorial readings. The third, advanced by Stanley Fish, submits (and dissolves) both author and reader to the notion of the interpretive community as the authority determining the proper meaning of a text. In this essay I investigate two of these rival theories, examining them in the light of more general pragmatist principles. The purpose of this exercise is not to award a prize for the most authentically pragmatist theory<br>

  Abstract: LOGIC FORMS the backbone of the

However, the logical discoveries—exemplified by the persistence and single-mindedness of the central character, Harry—constitute a recurring theme that weaves its way through the overall story, and thereby into the thought and talk of the classroom community of inquiry. For it is logic that holds our thinking together—the rules and principles of logic provide criteria for distinguishing better thinking from worse. It is logic in language that makes reasoning possible.<br>

  Author(s) KHAN SHAMUS<br>
  Abstract: I had never heard of classical music’s first principle until I read Michael Bell’s paper (that principle is “Do what you are told”). In fact, as a violinist, what immediately popped into my head as a “first principle” was “Play in tune!” This is exactly what I was told the first time I ever played for the pedagogue Dorothy DeLay (to be more accurate, I was told, “Sugarplum, you need to work on your intonation”).

  Abstract: I started playing the trumpet almost fi fteen years ago. Eleven of those years were spent studying classical music and the appropriate techniques of the style. I learned how to play by studying with band directors in school bands and with private instructors. I was taught to read music, to blend in with other musicians in an ensemble, and to take direction from a conductor. In other words, I am a classically trained musician. This training always included a focus on instruction and on learning the correct way to play. As Michael Bell points out, “the first principle of classical<br>

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

  Abstract: Much has been made in this book of the idea of modern cultural theory being ultimately ethical in its aims and outlook. Or at least, our principles of reading in relation to Adorno, Bourdieu and Foucault have been, in effect, ethico-critical ones; emphasising that these thinkers are best read not simply in ‘positive’ or epistemic terms but as contributing to a kind of ethically minded reconfiguration of ourselves as critical beings, something that has been shorthanded in terms of the ethics of autonomy.<br>

  Abstract: The immediate consequences from the 1790s onwards of the perceived failure of Kant’s attempt to ground philosophy in the principle of subjectivity are apparent in two areas of philosophy which carry the broad names ‘German Idealism’, which is mainly associated with Fichte, Schelling and Hegel; and ‘early Romanticism’, which is mainly associated with Novalis, Friedrich Schlegel and (in some respects) Friedrich Schleiermacher.¹ There are, as we shall see, crucial respects in which these two currents of thought can be distinguished. It would, though, be mistaken to regard either German Idealism or early Romanticism as unified philosophical schools, which is one<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kempshall Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an analytical overview of the vast range of historiography which was produced in western Europe over a thousand-year period between c.400 and c.1500. Concentrating on the general principles of classical rhetoric central to the language of this writing, alongside the more familiar traditions of ancient history, biblical exegesis and patristic theology, this survey introduces the conceptual sophistication and semantic rigour with which medieval authors could approach their narratives of past and present events, and the diversity of ends to which this history could then be put. By providing a close reading of some of the historians who put these linguistic principles and strategies into practice (from Augustine and Orosius through Otto of Freising and William of Malmesbury to Machiavelli and Guicciardini), it traces and questions some of the key methodological changes that characterise the function and purpose of the western historiographical tradition in this formative period of its development.<br>

  3  INVENTION AND NARRATIVE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: The categorisation of classical rhetoric into its demonstrative, judicial and deliberative forms reveals significant differences in emphasis, but also significant similarities in approach, in the way in which the relationship between an individual’s character (
                  mores) and deeds (res gestae) could, and should, be described by a speaker or writer. The principles which these three categories of rhetoric shared as common ground, however, exerted an impact on medieval historiography that went well beyond engineering the specific didactic, legal or political goals of particular works of history. This influence can be gauged by means of the two standard schemes according to which<br>

  Abstract: In setting out the principles by which arguments could be found in order to construct a narrative of people and of events, classical manuals of rhetoric gave central importance to the criterion of verisimilitude. Quintilian may have disagreed with those who thought that the
                  soleconcern of the orator was verisimilitude,¹ but otherwise medieval authors were presented with a very clear agenda: truth requires the art of rhetoric in order to make it plausible or convincing, in order to give it the appearance or simili tude of truth.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: The influence of classical rhetoric on the writing of history in the Middle Ages centred on the relationship between the depiction of character (attributes of person) and the description of deeds (attributes of events), on the invention of arguments (causation, testimony and proof), and on the construction of a brief, lucid and, above all, verisimilar narrative. This does not mean, of course, that all the principles involved in each one of these areas were applied either simultaneously or consistently across the broad range of writings which the single term

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: Medieval historiography was neither crude nor credulous nor conceptually unsophisticated. Such characterisations would be no more, and no less, applicable to the writing of history in the early modern and modern periods and, if only on this basis, medieval historians deserve better than to suffer the methodological condescension of posterity. The present study has been designed accordingly as an introduction to a set of interpretative criteria on which works of medieval historiography might be assessed, primarily through examining principles of classical rhetoric which would have been second-nature to writers who had been brought up, directly or indirectly, on the precepts<br>

  Abstract: For Jesus, the absolute of the spirit of the law¹ takes precedence over the absolute of the letter of the law. As an example, let us focus on Jesus healing the man with a lame hand on the Sabbath (Luke 6:6). At stake is the principle that the double Torah (written and oral) strives toward its own transcendence when, from being the rule of Israel
                  kata sarka(“Israel after the flesh”/the contingent Israel), it becomes, at last, the rule of the kingdom of God.² The former carries the seed of its own transformation. Thus, here and now, the law of<br>

One might argue that many of the apocalyptic wars of the twentieth century were driven and justified by utopian discourses—Marxism, fascism, religions, and various forms of nationalism. The fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to announce the start of the “happy ’90s,” and gave rise to Francis Fukuyama’s utopian idea of the “end of history,” the belief that “liberal democracy had, in principle, won out, that the advent of a global liberal community was hovering around the corner, and that the obstacles to this<br>

  Abstract: If the second vatican council’s contribution to the dialogue between faith and reason in our day has to be understood as a word of continuity in principle, with recognition of discontinuity in situations, then it is equally important to recognize how the situation has been redefined by the Magisterium and ministry of Pope St. John Paul II.

However Clines himself thinks that it is the ‘moral order of the world, of the principles on which it is governed’ by the divinity.¹ The two views are in fact related because the reality of innocent suffering questions in what sense, or whether in any sense, God’s governance of creation can be called just.

A central concern of the book is to argue for the perennial importance of ontological principles of Christology inherited from patristic and scholastic authors. However, the book also seeks to advance an interpretation of Thomistic Christology in a modern context. The teaching Aquinas, then, is central to the study, but it is placed in conversation with various modern theologians, such as Karl Barth, Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar. Ultimately the goal of the work is to suggest how traditional Catholic theology might thrive under modern conditions, and also develop fruitfully from engaging in contemporary controversies.<br>

  Book Title: The Renaissance of emotion-Understanding affect in Shakespeare and his contemporaries<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sullivan Erin<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays offers a major reassessment of the meaning and significance of emotional experience in the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Recent scholarship on early modern emotion has relied on a medical-historical approach, resulting in a picture of emotional experience that stresses the dominance of the material, humoral body. The Renaissance of emotion seeks to redress this balance by examining the ways in which early modern texts explore emotional experience from perspectives other than humoral medicine. The chapters in the book seek to demonstrate how open, creative and agency-ridden the experience and interpretation of emotion could be. Taken individually, the chapters offer much-needed investigations into previously overlooked areas of emotional experience and signification; taken together, they offer a thorough re-evaluation of the cultural priorities and phenomenological principles that shaped the understanding of the emotive self in the early modern period. The Renaissance of emotion will be of particular interest to students and scholars of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature, the history of emotion, theatre and cultural history, and the history of ideas.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt175x2ht">Democracy, Culture, Catholicism: Voices from Four Continents</a><br>
  Abstract: What profoundly marks Catholicism’s relationship to democracy and culture in Indonesia is the fact that Catholics are a minority in a majority Muslim country. Yet, given the profound commitment of Indonesians to the principles of democracy, Catholics have often found themselves at the table of political and civic discourse and involved in the processes of democratization. Nevertheless, the contributions Catholics have made to Indonesian society and government have always remained in the shadow of their minority status. Because of this status, Indonesian Catholics struggle to find their voice and to come to terms with the reality of precisely how effective<br>

  Author(s) Yudianti Francisca Ninik<br>
  Abstract: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is driven by the idea that businesses are part of society and therefore ought to contribute positively to social conditions and goals. Some of these conditions and goals include the democratic principles of respect for human rights, the rule of law, and transparent decision-making. CSR proponents argue that businesses should be held accountable not only for their economic impact on society but also for the other non-economic consequences of their activities on society and the natural environment.¹ There is growing pressure on businesses to respect human rights and the rule of law wherever they operate, to<br>

  Abstract: What greatly marks the relationships between democracy, culture, and Catholicism in the United States are the particular political and theological contexts from which the identity of US citizens emerged. The republic was established on the principles of democracy, and its culture was greatly affected and influenced by the prominent place enjoyed by Protestant Christianity among the people. Catholicism was an “outsider” religion that was not to be trusted and, worse, appeared to be completely incompatible with the political and cultural milieu of the nation. What the authors in this section seek to illustrate is the positive role Catholicism has played<br>

  Abstract: While few cultural anthropologists practicing today would be willing to label culturally bound human behaviors as “evil,” many apply this label to the gruesome individual and collective acts that constituted the 1994 genocide of Tutsis, politically moderate Hutus, and others defined as an “enemy of the state.” Because evil, conceived of as the opposite of good, is defined by a moral system, its application in a particular context involves moral judgment and violates the principle of cultural relativism, which lies at the heart of anthropology. Furthermore, on the continent of Africa, the concept of evil is inextricably tied up in<br>

  Abstract: In the French Church, always full of subtle shadings, a tacit distinction has arisen between Catholic Action groups, mandated by the Church, and other organizations reflecting Catholic principles. Groups which are mandated exist primarily because of their religious functions. They are integral parts of the Church, instruments of a particular form of evangelization. Their civic and political activities can be limited by the Hierarchy itself. They are always willing to follow, in temporal as in spiritual affairs, the advice of their ecclesiastical counsellors. On the other hand, the organizations outside of Catholic Action, though they might have “Church approval,” exist<br>

  Abstract: Outside of a narrow range of dogma, Catholics disagree among themselves on practically everything relating to social and temporal life. Yet there are certain social principles which have very widespread acceptance among the vast majority of Catholics in France. Usually most members of the Hierarchy endorse these principles, though they are not considered as Church dogma. In fact, they have become so generally identified with Catholicism that Catholics with different views must usually explain their reasons for going against the crowd.<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

This trademark sentence of Jenson’s is, as Stanley Hauerwas observes, both “elegantly simple” and “dauntingly deep.”³ At the heart of this dense slogan is the principle that Christian discourse about God intends and is made possible by a specific reality. “God,” as we have seen Jenson argue, is intrinsically specifiable, because God is known by and with a history. The God Jesus addressed as Father and who raised him from the dead was not a previously unknown deity. Rather, as Jenson states, “It is the God<br>

Moreover, according to Butler, the commandment, as Benjamin conceives of it, constitutes the condition for a theory of responsibility that would be fundamentally concerned with the ongoing struggle with nonviolence.

  Abstract: For many, the rhetoric supporting the institution of slavery was constructed simply. Once one got past establishing the nonhuman nature of blacks, the rest was easy. If whites had any moral obligation in the matter, it was to use blacks to further the interests of society, a society from which the black was excluded. The horrific conditions of slave existence became the tokens of charity and benevolence to the black brute. This particular rhetoric took various forms but always avoided any real conflict in values and principles by placing blacks outside the community of humans.<br>

In the middle of the nineteenth century a sense of racial destiny permeated discussions of American progress and of future American world destiny. Many think of rampant doctrines of Caucasian, Aryan, or Anglo-Saxon destiny as typical of the late years of the nineteenth century, but they flourished in the United States in the era of the Mexican War.<br>

  Population Aesthetics in Romantic and Post-Romantic Literature from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c99996">Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism</a><br>
  Author(s) Mitchell Robert<br>
  Abstract: Though the Romantic-era debate between William Godwin and Thomas Malthus seemed to have concluded in the 1820s in something of a stalemate, this conversation has been recently been revived, though with a rather peculiar twist. The Romantic-era version of this debate pitted Godwin’s principle of perfectibility against Malthus’s principle of population, with Godwin arguing that social relations could be slowly perfected to the extent that legal and political “institutions” were eliminated and Malthus countering that a key determinant of collective behavior was located in the biological register of “population.” Malthus contended that the register of population was inaccessible to human<br>

  Abstract: In a text entitled “Pour une philosophie non théologique,”¹ Mikel Dufrenne noted the profound ambiguity in Heideggerian thought with regard to the theological tradition. On the one hand, Heidegger is the pioneer of the “philosophies of absence,” and he separates the “appearing” from any transcendent or ontic principle. On the other hand (even though he denies it), his argumentation has crypto-theological accents to it: being, which conceals itself in its own names, like the unutterable God of negative theology, safeguarding its truth in a meditative and almost religious experience.

  Abstract: IN THIS chapter, I consider Milton’s intervention in the debate concerning things indifferent in his prose works. As we will see, in enlarging the sphere of things indifferent and giving the individual conscience discretion in such matters, Milton departs from the usual puritan position, according to which “nothing is indifferent.” At the same time, he develops the principle of indifference into a rhetoric, thereby dramatizing his awareness that the sphere of indifference is the sphere of rhetoric, in which persuasion and action may take place. Milton’s Machiavellism in his prose works is both general and specific. In reflecting on the<br>

  Book Title: Wallace Stevens among Others-Diva-Dames, Deleuze, and American Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): JARRAWAY DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: In Wallace Stevens among Others David Jarraway explores the extraordinary achievement of Wallace Stevens, but in contexts that are not usually thought about in connection with Stevens's work - gay literature, contemporary fiction, Hollywood film, and avant-garde architecture, among others. By viewing the poet among these "other" contexts, Jarraway considers the nature of self-reflection and pays special attention to the discrediting of self-presence as the principle of identity in American writing - a theme that reflects American authors’ abiding concern for subjectivities that engage the world from spaces of distance and difference. By returning to the work of Stevens, Jarraway seeks to refurbish this preoccupation by linking it to the literary theory of French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, whose work applies to American writers from Melville and Whitman to Fitzgerald and Cummings. Jarraway forges the link between Deleuze and Stevens by drawing out the female subjectivity found in each writer’s work to rethink the more static masculinist premises of being. Informed by a deep knowledge of and fluency with the work of Stevens and Deleuze, Jarraway uses these writers as a means of entry into American literature and culture, Wallace Stevens among Others is a sophisticated analysis that will open new directions for future scholarship.<br>

  Abstract: John Howard Yoder frequently described his basic outlook as that of a “free church” theologian.¹ Anabaptist convictions about the meaning of Christian discipleship led to the rejection of infant baptism, the separation of church and state, and the elevation of a scripture-centered community ethic above doctrine as a principle of unity.² In each case, the impetus to free the church from identification with the civil community was derived from a command of Christ as recorded in the New Testament: baptize believers (Matt 18; Mark 16); do not take up the sword or otherwise resist evil (Matt 5:39); order your community<br>

  Abstract: Evangelicals uphold the supremacy and authority of the Holy Scripture. As noted by Anthony Lane, the
                  sola Scripturaprinciple essentially holds that Scripture is the final authority or norm for Christian belief. As Lane acknowledges, the finality of Scripture should always be fiercely defended, but it is not the sole source or resource for theology. Lane further explains that there is no need to regard thesola Scripturaprinciple as antithetical to the validity of church tradition, Christian experience, human reason, or cultural understanding.¹ Without undermining thesola Scripturaprinciple, this paper asserts that it is possible to construct a<br>

  Author(s) Zamagni Stefano<br>
  Abstract: One of the marks of our time is a constant call for ethics, which has progressively replaced, over the past quarter of a century, the persistent call for politics typical of the 1960s, when it was imagined that “everything was politics.” But this agreement on the primacy of ethics ceases when it comes to tangible moral issues. As Alasdair McIntyre observed in
                     After Virtue, the apodictic use of moral principles serves only to put an end to the ethical dialogue itself. In other words, the broad convergence on ethics in public debate almost never translates into ethical consensus.<br>

  Abstract: The title of my presentation is an invitation to explore the contributions of liberation theology in Latin America and the Caribbean and the challenges it poses to the twenty-first century. I come as a witness that takes seriously the context in which this theology was developed. As the late Taiwanese theologian Shoki Coe, Director of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches in the 1970s, used to stress, contextualizing theology as an ongoing process becomes a key hermeneutical principle both in educating for the ministry and promoting a relevant theology.¹<br>

  Chapter Two  Challenging the Holy Marriage: from:

  Abstract: Relevance Theory is a development of communication theory springing from Paul Grice’s notion that there must be a ‘Co-operative Principle’ at work in conversation. This principle underwrites Maxims of Conversation underlying our ability to communicate. One of these, the so-called Maxim of Relation, simply specifies this: Be Relevant. Grice observed that speakers in conversation seem to observe this maxim, both in speaking and in interpreting, and that it is this ‘unspoken agreement’ which allows communication to take place, despite the indeterminacy of reference which is characteristic of language. Two linguists, Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson picked up this ball in<br>

  Abstract: As a “new Christianity” began to unhinge from dependency upon the Christian institutions of the Atlantic churches, the awareness that new ways of doing theology would emerge grew gradually and in some circles begrudgingly. In time the search for insights from Christian thinking led to engagement. Theologians such as Karl Barth, Paul Lehmann, and Visser ’T Hooft addressed the theoretical side of problems that had to be faced, such as the form an ecumenical theology can take and the relation between dogma and ethics. The key, it was believed, is found in the deceptively simple principle that faith informs theological<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>

  Abstract: Christian ethics is less a system of principles, rules, or even virtues, and more of a free and open-ended responsible witness to God's gracious action to be with and for others and the world. <CR><CR> Postmodernity has left us with the risky uncertainty of knowing and doing the good. It also leaves us with the global risks of political violence and terrorism, economic globalization and financial crisis, and environmental destruction and global climate change. How should Christians respond to these problems? Haddorf creatively explores how Christian ethics is best understood as a witness to God's action, bringing together two of his interests, Christian social ethics and social theory, and the theology and ethics of Karl Barth. <CR><CR> Although demanding and sometimes uncertain after postmodern changes, christian ethics enable humankind to remain God's witnesses of love and care for the future, even in a world at risk.<br>

  Abstract: Our attempt to understand the unity of being in terms of gift so far has brought to light the primal character of gift. Gift is a primal, a principle, inasmuch as it is a permanent source. The positivity of concrete singular beings suggested by originary experience rests on the permanent, personal principle of originating and ordering, a Father whose face we are invited to see in his beloved, Incarnate Son. Gift is also a primal because it indicates “first-ness.” According to this second sense of “primal,” being’s primordial unity is an ever-new beginning. Each concrete singular being is created; it<br>

  Book Title: Is There a Canadian Philosophy?-Reflections on the Canadian Identity<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): HARRIS INGRID<br>
  Abstract: Is There a Canadian Philosophy?addresses the themes of community, culture, national identity, and universal human rights, taking the Canadian example as its focus. The authors argue that nations compelled to cope with increasing demands for group recognition may do so in a broadly liberal spirit and without succumbing to the dangers associated with an illiberal, adversarial multiculturalism. They identify and describe a Canadian civic philosophy and attempt to show how thismodus operandiof Canadian public life is capable of reconciling questions of collective identity and recognition with a commitment to individual rights and related principles of liberal democracy. They further argue that this philosophy can serve as a model for nations around the world faced with internal complexities and growing demands for recognition from populations more diverse than at any previous time in their histories.<br>

  Abstract: It is an old Canadian political impulse to seek reconciliation between apparent opposites both at the levels of political philosophy and practice. Perhaps a legacy of the historic agreement that brought together in a single nation cultures as diverse as the English, the French, and an assortment of aboriginal peoples, the practice of seeking political consensus through compromise—sometimes at the expense of principle—has long been the norm in Canadian political culture.

  Author(s) Munro Bradley R.<br>
  Abstract: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948. That the Universal Declaration could be proclaimed by a body representative of most of the world’s states is a remarkable achievement and worthy of celebration in this so-called postmodern world. Indeed, most of the states that since joined the General Assembly have also endorsed the UDHR. Truly remarkable about this tremendous achievement is the UDHR embracing a whole series of principles and value statements that define what constitutes human dignity. The world has an exceedingly rich array of cultures,<br>

  Author(s) West J.L.A.<br>
  Abstract: The following paper is divided into three sections. The first section briefly reviews the history of the concept of rights and its significance in the ongoing debate between liberals and communitarians. The contemporary literature has overlooked the possibility of constructing a theory of rights on Thomistic principles, which would reconcile individual rights with the common good. The second section reviews Aquinas’s position with respect to unjust laws in the
                  Summa Theologiaeand draws attention to the prominence of the principle of equality in his discussion. This principle is sufficient to provide the basis for a viable theory of individual rights<br>

                  The Concept of Law,are essentially sound and are fundamental in displaying the moral foundations of legal systems. Yet we must also come to understand that assent to the fundamental rules of human conduct that Hart notes is compatible with an acceptance of a thorough ethical relativism or conventionalism.

  Abstract: At the outset of the

  Abstract: While Heidegger takes a general ontological perspective, Blanchot deals with the question of the event as an interrogation that mainly concerns the being of literature. Language is no longer the channel through which Being and man come to belong to one another; the fictive essence of language according to Blanchot deprives the subject of self and robs the real of sense. If Heidegger regards poetry as a truthful principle that is the source and foundation of man’s dwelling, Blanchot assigns it an illusory principle that affects both the experience of the writer and the written work itself.

  Author(s) RODSETH LARS<br>
  Abstract: Historical events, as opposed to trends and processes, have always been difficult to capture in a “scientific” frame. Trends and processes can be explained, in principle, by feedback mechanisms such as self-regulating markets and balances of power. Indeed, simple homeostatic devices such as the fantail, even as they made possible the industrial revolution, served as the first modern models of political economy (Wootton 2007:42). Specific events, however, seem to slip the net of scientific explanation. Whether they are truly random or just impossible to predict from a human standpoint, events often defy our best efforts to organize and make sense<br>

  Author(s): Matos Jaime Rodríguez<br>
  Abstract: In this book, Jaime Rodr+¡guez Matos proposes the GÇ£formlessGÇ¥ as a point of departure in thinking through the relationship between politics and time. Thinking through both literary and political writings around the Cuban Revolution, Rodr+¡guez Matos explores the link between abstract symbolic procedures and various political experiments that have sought to give form to a principle of sovereignty based on the category of representation. In doing so, he proposes the formless as the limit of modern and contemporary reflections on the meaning of politics while exploring the philosophical consequences of a formless concept of temporality for the critique of metaphysics._x000D_ Rodr+¡guez Matos takes the writing and thought of Jos+¬ Lezama Lima as the guiding thread in exploring the possibility of a politicity in which time is imagined beyond the disciplining functions it has had throughout the metaphysical traditionGÇöa time of the absence of time, in which the absence of time no longer means eternity.<br>

At present, the dominant constitutive practice of contemporary social relations is the global market. Production, distribution, and consumption are constituted for the purposes either of making money or of providing “value for money”—that is, a value subject to public measurement. These economic principles, by giving a public and social representation of diverse needs and impulses, usurp the place<br>

  6  Abstraction and Montage in the Work of Kurt Schwitters from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gk08k8">The Chatter of the Visible</a><br>
  Abstract: Perhaps no other artist has offered as comprehensive and layered an exploration of montage as Kurt Schwitters, whose imaginative engagement with strategies of disarticulation and assemblage over four decades casts a long shadow on the art of the twentieth century.¹ Working in a variety of media, Schwitters pushed the bounds of montage with a single-mindedness that is only matched by the doggedness with which he interrogated the enabling conditions of his artistic practice. Yet precisely his reflection on montage as a fundamental aesthetic principle has presented a formidable stumbling block for Schwitters scholars ever since the rediscovery of his oeuvre<br>

  Chapter 4  THE DESTINY OF MAN IS MAN: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxp8qf">Modern European Tragedy</a><br>
  Author(s) BRECHT BERTOLT<br>
  Abstract: The form of tragedy and the traditional mode of expressing man’s tragic condition in the theatre were, as is well known, some of Bertolt Brecht’s most controversial targets.¹ There are two sets of reasons for this. The first is technical, because classical tragedy and the drama that derives from it belong, as Brecht saw it, to a kind of theatre that does not arouse the critical spirit and the dialectical attitude. The second is philosophical, because they are founded on an idea of destiny and the immutability or universality of human thought, in conflict with Brecht’s Marxian principles.²<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpb96">Knowledge and Human Liberation</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, we explore the challenge of rethinking modernist knowledge by looking at Kant’s conception of anthropology. Kant taught courses in both anthropology and physical geography, and his book
                  Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of Viewwas published nearly thirty years after his initial engagement with anthropology. While his lectures embodied Kant’s crisis of identity as a professional philosopher, thus facilitating a border crossing between philosophy and anthropology,Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of Viewwas far short of his earlier critique of metaphysics and wanted anthropology to play by universal principles if not be totally subordinated to metaphysics.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h4mhzd">Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8</a><br>
  Abstract: In Rom 8:1–17, Paul uses the verb περιπατέω (“walk”) metaphorically to depict the religioethical conduct of believers. Indeed, the most common way that Paul talks about believers’ religious and moral behavior in his epistles is in terms of the human experience and knowledge of walking.¹ Paul’s figurative use of περιπατέω occurs in all of the letters that are attributed to him except Philemon, the briefest, and the pastorals, the most disputed.² In the present chapter, I will deploy concepts and principles of Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory introduced in chapter 2 in my examination of the constructions<br>

  Abstract: Practice without thought is blind; thought without practice is empty. The three segments of African society which I specified in the last chapter, the traditional, the Western, and the Islamic, coexist uneasily; the principles ani mating them are often in conflict with one another.

  Abstract: The question must now be confronted: How comes it then that, despite the extolled self-apprehending virtues of these and other works, it is possible to entertain a hostile attitude towards the programmatic summation in the secular vision of negritude? There is none of these works whose ideals may not be interpreted as the realization of the principles of race-retrieval which are embodied in the concept of negritude, yet negritude continues to arouse more than a mere semantic impatience among the later generation of African writers and intellectuals, in addition to—let this be remembered—serious qualifications of or tactical withdrawal<br>

  Abstract: Indisputably, gender has been a fundamental organizing principle in Western societies.¹ Intrinsic to the conceptualization of gender is a dichotomy in which male and female, man and woman, are constantly and binarily ranked, both in relationship to and against each other. It has been well documented that the categories of male and female in Western social practice are not free of hierarchical associations and binary oppositions in which the male implies privilege and the female subordination. It is a duality based on a perception of human sexual dimorphism inherent in the definition of gender. Yorùbá society, like many other societies<br>

  Abstract: Blacks must be clear about what they ultimately want, and can reasonably expect, from group solidarity. Do blacks want to maintain themselves indefinitely as a distinct, politically autonomous subnation and to view their autonomy, not simply as a means to full and equal civic standing within a multiracial democratic polity, but as an intrinsic goal? Or should they, following the principles of pragmatic nationalism, regard themselves as a community burdened by the stigma of race and racial inequality, collectively seeking to bring about a society where individuals are no longer unfairly disadvantaged because of their racial classification?<br>

  Abstract: In recent decades, the vision of a genuinely ecological economics has focused on the principle of sustainability. Capitalism, we are told, should be refashioned as a “sustainable economy” whose growth, in the words of the United Nation’s Brundtland Commission Report, “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of FUTURE generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland 1987). Like other liberal political ideals (e.g., democracy, freedom, tolerance), the ideological work performed by sustainability is complex and multivalent. As Joan Martinez-Alier (2009) notes, ecological economics understands the economy not as a system of exchange but rather as a metabolic<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Book Title: Prophetic Politics-Emmanuel Levinas and the Sanctification of Suffering<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAROLD PHILIP J.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Prophetic Politics,Philip J. Haroldoffers an original interpretation of the political dimension of Emmanuel Levinas's thought. Harold argues that Levinas's mature position inOtherwise Than Beingbreaks radically with the dialogical inclinations of his earlierTotality and Infinityand that transformation manifests itself most clearly in the peculiar nature of Levinas's relationship to politics.Levinas's philosophy is concerned not with the ethical per se, in either its applied or its transcendent forms, but with the source of ethics. Once this source is revealed to be an anarchic interruption of our efforts to think the ethical, Levinas's political claims cannot be read as straightforward ideological positions or principles for political action. They are instead to be understood "prophetically," a position that Harold finds comparable to the communitarian critique of liberalism offered by such writers as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor. In developing this interpretation, which runs counter to formative influences from the phenomenological tradition, Harold traces Levinas's debt to phenomenological descriptions of such experiences as empathy and playfulness.Prophetic Politicswill highlight the relevance of the phenomenological tradition to contemporary ethical and political thought-a long-standing goal of the series-while also making a significant and original contribution to Levinas scholarship.<br>

  Abstract: Many Evangelical Protestant missions, including many of the largest and most influential, have their roots in the faith-mission tradition. Examples of such missions include the China Inland Mission (now the Overseas Missionary Fellowship), Africa Inland Mission, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Wycliffe Bible Translators, and New Tribes. The founding principle, which remained the most distinctive characteristic of faith missions, was that they permitted no overt fundraising but relied on quiet faith in God to meet financial needs.<br>

  Abstract: “Secularism” is a philosophy that holds that the affairs and organization of society should be arranged according to principles and rules derived from experience and human insight without reference to customs, revelations, or sacred books whose authority is derived from God or the gods or ancestors. It is distinct from the process of “secularization” whereby the state, professions such as medicine and law, and academic fields such as archeology gradually take over areas of human life once governed by religion and the church. Both words derive from the Latin word

  Abstract: The possibility of such a command as, “Love God above all and thy neighbor as thyself,” agrees very well with this. For, as a command, it requires esteem for a law which orders love and does not leave it to arbitrary choice to make love the principle.

  Abstract: In contemporary anthropology, much is made of the ways in which meaning is constructed by a culture’s members. The interpretive act by which sense is asserted, such as in the interpretation of art or dreams or language, is a moment m which such constructions of meaning become particularly clear. It seems therefore a particularly vital point at which to observe a culture’s workings. The meeting of individuals and events that interpretation implies is a reapplication of principles, occasionally a revision, rarely, in Java at least, a radical reconsideration of them.

  Abstract: Although this passage from

Besides the illustrations already noted (from opera, stage scenery, and landscape painting), there is another from an art which had its heyday in the previous century. In the pleasure we experience at the sight of a fine landscape garden, he sees the type of that mimetic restructuring of reality which we enjoy in a good drama.<br>

  Abstract: The Enlightenment's critique of tradition was a necessary consequence of the fundamental modern principle that we humans are solely responsible for the course of history. Hence we can accept no belief, no authority, no institutions that are not in some way justified. This foundation, for better or for worse, determined the course of the following centuries. Despite contemporary reactions against it, the Enlightenment continues to shape our own time and still distinguishes Western culture from any other.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npqs8">Freedom and Time</a><br>
  Abstract: Democratic self-government cannot be achieved, even in principle, by way of a politics of popular voice. It requires an inscriptive politics, through which a people struggles to memorialize, interpret, and hold itself to its own foundational commitments over time. I will call this idea: constitutionalism as democracy. The purpose of this and the final three chapters is to lay out the basic terms of constitutionalism as democracy: its theory of judicial review, its interpretive method, its fundamental rights.<br>

  Book Title: Abraham's Children-Liberty and Tolerance in an Age of Religious Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): CLARK KELLY JAMES<br>
  Abstract: In this vitally important book, fifteen influential practitioners of the Abrahamic religions address religious liberty and tolerance from the perspectives of their own faith traditions. Former President Jimmy Carter, Rabbi Arik Ascherman, Indonesia's first democratically elected president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and the other writers draw on their personal experiences and on the sacred writings that are central in their own religious lives. Rather than relying on "pure reason," as secularists might prefer, the contributors celebrate religious traditions and find within them a way toward mutual peace, uncompromised liberty, and principled tolerance. Offering a counterbalance to incendiary religious leaders who cite Holy Writ to justify intolerance and violence, the contributors reveal how tolerance and respect for believers in other faiths stands at the core of the Abrahamic traditions.<br>

  Abstract: When I think about the universal principle of “accepting the other,” I am reminded of a story we are taught in Islam about Prophet Abraham and the Zoroastrian. It is a wonderful example of how faith teaches us to love one another, regardless of our individual religious paths.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq07j">Abraham's Children</a><br>
  Author(s) GÜLEN M. FETHULLAH<br>
  Abstract: A religion, philosophy, or ideology should be viewed from the perspective of its sources, basic nature, and principles. Just as it is not possible to understand Marxism without knowing Karl Marx or Hinduism without knowing the Vedas and Upanishads, neither can any Divine religion— whether it be Judaism, Christianity, or Islam—be known without knowing its basic sources and foundations: God, the reality of Divine revelation, and the sacred books, such as the Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur’an, which were formed from Divine revelations. The main source of Judaism and the Torah is God, the main source of Christianity<br>

  TWO  What Is the Western Tradition? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pv897r">The Vision of the Soul</a><br>
  Abstract: We saw in the Introduction that conservatism seeks to defend a particular vision of human life that George Santayana defined as Christian Platonic in nature. In chapter 1, I considered one aspect of that vision: how it envisions human happiness in comparison with typical modern accounts of it. It now seems appropriate to ask a more foundational question. If conservatism seeks to conserve the western tradition, then what are that tradition’s constitutive principles?<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Criteria for Democratic Inquiry from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt43v">The Priority of Injustice</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I want to elaborate further on why thinking about democracy in an ordinary way, as suggested at the end of the previous chapter, should lead us away from supposing that there is a particular form of politics that is properly political, as if grasping this form would allow lesser forms to be characterized as postpolitical. In particular, I want to consider how best to understand the problem of deriving “context-transcending” principles from the specific situations in which the meanings of democratic politics are articulated. I take it for granted that this possibility can no longer be premised<br>

  CHAPTER 7  Subjects of Domination from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt43v">The Priority of Injustice</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I argued that debates about cosmopolitanism, environmental issues, global poverty, and transnational migration have helped to draw into view the norm of all-affectedness as the central reference point for thinking about democratic legitimacy. It is easy enough to think that the principle of all affected interests exhausts the question of
                  whoshould constitute the democratic polity. But the principle of affectedness also relates to questions of effective agency, that is, to the capacity to do things. It refers to thehowof democracy as well the identity of who is affected. The translation of the all<br>

  Solidarity with the Elderly and the Allocation of Resources from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q8jj8k">A World Growing Old</a><br>
  Author(s) ter Meulen Ruud H. J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the cornerstones of European health care systems is the principle of solidarity. The care of the elderly, including health care and social care, is in many respects based on this principle: the young contribute to the costs of care for the old, who have a greater risk of disease and handicaps. But the increasing demand for care by the elderly—resulting from epidemiological changes as well as various social processes—is putting solidarity between the young and the old under strain. Particularly the medicalization of old age, which is draining away resources from long-term care, is an important<br>

  Abstract: This book illuminates issues in medical ethics revolving around the complex bond between healer and patient, focusing on friendship and other important values in the healing relationship. Embracing medicine, philosophy, theology, and bioethics, it considers whether bioethical issues in medicine, nursing, and dentistry can be examined from the perspective of the healing relationship rather than external moral principles.<br>

  Book Title: Biographical methods and professional practice-An international perspective<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Apitzsch Ursula<br>
  Abstract: The turn to biographical methods in social science is invigorating the relationship between policy and practice. This book shows how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the development of professionals, and promote more meaningful practitioner - service user relationships.This book uses a range of interpretive approaches to reveal the dynamics of service users' and professionals' individual experiences and life-worlds. From their research the contributors show how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the learning and development of professionals, and promote more meaningful and creative practitioner - service user relationships. The book: · reviews applications of biographical methods in both policy and practice in a range of professional contexts, from health and social care to education and employment; · explores the impact of social change in three main arenas - transformation from Eastern to Western types of society in Europe, major shifts in social and welfare principles, experiences of immigration and of new cultural diversities - on professional practice; · critically evaluates subjective and reflexive processes in interactions between researchers, practitioners and users of services; · considers the institutional arrangements and cultural contexts which support effective and sensitive interventions; · draws on actual projects and tracks reflection, progress and outcomes. With contributions from leading international experts, it provides a valuable comparative perspective. Researchers, policy analysts and practitioners, postgraduate students, teachers and trainers will find this book a stimulating read.<br>

  Abstract: Although speakers in historiography do much of their reasoning through citation and application of the
                  Shiand other texts, they also call on many types of knowledge beyond the reach of inherited language. TheZuozhuanandGuoyushow a more sustained interest in the workings of the natural and supernatural worlds than any extant earlier works and go well beyond early Zhou texts in reasoning about the cosmos and its principles. When speeches incorporate this sort of knowledge, they put it to political and moral use, if only because the position defined for speeches within this system requires such use.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter features a systematization of Panikkar’s later Christology, which is characterized by an escalation of the incipient pluralist trends found in the first edition of the
                  Unknown Christ of Hinduism. It is also marked by an utter departure from the conviction that Jesus’s person and work is constitutively key to the relationship between God and the world. The chapter will also evaluate Panikkar’s later christological development based upon priorities and principles earlier drawn from “Meditaciόn sobre Melquisedec” andLe mystère du culte, as well as various systematic theologians. I will also set Panikkar’s later theology within a wider personal<br>

  JUSTICE AS FRATERNITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tqx7xh">Civitas augescens. Includere e comparare nell'Europa di oggi</a><br>
  Author(s) Puyol Angel<br>
  Abstract: The French Revolution proclaimed an ethical and political ideal with its three principles that have not been improved on since: liberty, equality and fraternity. Since then, western political philosophy has put its greatest efforts into analysing the former two (liberty and equality), but has ignored, and even disdained, the third part of the revolutionary triad: fraternity. In my opinion, forgetting or underestimating fraternity as a political category is unjustifiable, given that so many injustices in our world are not only related to a lack of liberty and equality, but also to the scarcity, and sometimes inexistence, of fraternity.<br>

  The Generation of Conceptual Changes in Literary Study from:

  Abstract: Since a centennial is an opportunity to look backward and forward, I have chosen a subject that I feel is appropriate to the occasion: the generation of conceptual changes in literary study. The kind of changes I refer to are what Foucault called epistemic changes, what Meyer Abrams has characterized as a change from a pragmatic to an organic orientation, what the anthropologist Clifford Geertz calls “an alteration of the principles of mapping. Something is happening to the way we think about the way we think.”¹ The conceptual change I refer to is what Brian McHale and other postmodern critics<br>

  Renewing the Eighteenth Century from:

  Abstract: The past decade has seen the publication of
                     The New Eighteenth Century(1987), “A New History of the Enlightenment?” (1992), and a considerable number of reinterpretations of the century. Writing the interpretation of an earlier historical time, contemporary critics and theorists correctly insist that they see the past through the eyes of the present. But what in our divided and fragmented world governs our visions or perceptions of the past? We insist on the need for self-reflection, on the analysis of our principles, but these are inevitably governed and constricted by the perceptions we have received and constructed.<br>

Memory cultures are not unique and confined in time and space, but are subject to what the sociologist Ulrich Beck calls ‘polycentric memory, in which non-state, transnational actors (such as social movements) also play a role’¹ – a model which he perceives to be a key to the constitution of a European memory culture.

  Author(s) Hahn Ottokar<br>
  Abstract: As a statement of principle, the Marxism and Leninism as applied by Lenin and Stalin have nothing to do with socialism. They are complete perversions of the great vision of socialism. And instead of creating a free society of equal chances and international solidarity, they established an especially crude form of capitalism and of national supremacy.<br>

  Author(s) Frankenberg Günter<br>
  Abstract: Solidarity as a voluntary act of recognizing others as deserving one’s esteem, care and support is possible in a secular society where the responsibility to help is not always already commanded by religion, tradition, or status (noblesse oblige). Yet, solidarity seems to be almost impossible in a society based on contractual relations governed (a) by the principle
                  pacta sunt servandaand (b) by the idea of liberty that establishes a system of limited irresponsibility (the limits being contracts and some obligations for “dependents”). That is why societies that we have come to regard as modern do not rely on social<br>

  Abstract: The breakdown of the Berlin wall and more generally, the failure of communism in the (now former) Soviet Union and eastern Europe has suddenly put an end to half a century of cold war. The division of the world in two opposing blocs is over. The nuclear danger looks much less imposing and real. The existential enemy has vanished and the political, ideological, and military threats that the enemy was supposed to embody have faded within a short period of time.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xhr62h">The Forgiveness to Come</a><br>
  Abstract: In the introduction, I analyzed in what sense the invention of a concept of “crimes against humanity” in international law may be interpreted as a sign of moral progress, a sign of history (

By virtue of this concept, the international community recognizes—at least in principle—a crime whose seriousness is such that it remains universally and eternally open to prosecution. In this chapter, I shall analyze in what senses the concept of “crimes against humanity” remains, despite this moral advance, bound to a humanist metaphysics whose limits today more than ever need to be<br>

  Abstract: The overturning of Arendt’s views is not limited to the judgment on Rome, since it also proceeds by means of a symmetrical inversion in the shadow of this argument. By this I mean that the very Christianity that Arendt situates as the commencement of the drift toward the modern constitutes for Weil both its internal rampart and its principle source of contention simultaneously. Indeed, for Weil Christianity is the spiritual thread that allows modernity to continue advancing in light of its originary inspiration. This does not mean that the two interpretative horizons are openly contradictory. They even coincide at one<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005szf">A Theory of Musical Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: The spectrum of narrative phases discussed in the previous chapter is essentially an extension of the narrative level of analysis outlined in chapter 4. As a result, it is—like the narrative level itself—a deductive taxonomy determined by the general principles of musical narrative and superimposed upon the musical domain. Narrative phases thus enable a greater degree of interpretive subtlety: with expansion of the four basic archetypes according to secondary criteria that vary by degree (instead of by kind), more precise comparisons can be made within the larger categorical frames.<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding pages, I have elaborated and illustrated a theory of musical narrative that is both grounded in principles applicable to narrative media in general and organized around discourses that are specifically musical. In place of the subtle and not-so-subtle distortions arising from a literature-based approach to narrative, this book reconstitutes the fundamentals of narrative theory in terms of Liszkian transvaluation, recognizing that the shifting hierarchical organization of our various “cultures”—psychic, interpersonal, social—lies at the heart of our subject.<br>

  Abstract: The twenty principles of the mimetic hypothesis that I describe in this chapter are meant to specify the nature of mimetic comprehension of music.¹ The role of mimetic comprehension in music conceptualization (chaps. 4–6) and in the creation of musical affect (chaps. 8 and 9) reflects the details and variables considered here. Although the extent of variability means that mimetic processes do not provide a uniform basis for conceptualization and affective responses, this variability appears to be integral to the nature of musical experience, conceptualization, and meaning.<br>

  Book Title: Comics and Narration-  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Miller Ann<br>
  Abstract: This book is the follow-up to Thierry Groensteen's ground-breaking
         The System of Comics, in which the leading French-language comics theorist set out to investigate how the medium functions, introducing the principle of iconic solidarity, and showing the systems that underlie the articulation between panels at three levels: page layout, linear sequence, and nonsequential links woven through the comic book as a whole. He now develops that analysis further, using examples from a very wide range of comics, including the work of American artists such as Chris Ware and Robert Crumb. He tests out his theoretical framework by bringing it up against cases that challenge it, such as abstract comics, digital comics and sh?jo manga, and offers insightful reflections on these innovations.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from:

  Abstract: The System of Comics, published in the original French in 1999 and in English translation in 2007, set out to theorize the foundations of the language of comics. This theory was macrosemiotic in its scope: it was not concerned with the details of single images, but with the articulation of images within the space of the page and across that of the book as a whole. The principle oficonic solidaritywas shown to be applicable to three major operations: breakdown, page layout, and braiding. The book had the further aim of describing the formal apparatus through which meaning is<br>

  Abstract: Several authors who have tried to apply the concepts defined in

This does not surprise me asSystem 1was never intended to be a textbook offering a ready-to-use analytical grid. And neither did it offer a research methodology. Its goal was to interrogate the basic principles of the language of the medium, to identify its functions, to study its articulations, at<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: In order to contribute to the renewal of moral theology,¹ I shall critically assess, contrast, and integrate two levels of observation and reflection concerning human agency: a psychosocial resilience perspective, on the one hand, and St. Thomas Aquinas’ virtue theory and theology of character, on the other. Previously, we saw that resilience research offers anthropological insights about extreme cases of adversity, as well as more typical challenges to growth. In this chapter, I widen the focus, by addressing how these studies relate to ethical principles and moral reflection. Aquinas’ virtue anthropology and moral theology offer a qualitative vision of human<br>

  TWO  Christian Marriage from:

  Abstract: Humanae Vitae depends on a Christian understanding of the nature or meaning of marriage and in particular on a Christian understanding of the importance of the marital gift of having children. Although the condemnation of contraception fundamentally depends on natural law principles, the Church draws on specifically Christian understandings when it calls on Christian disciples to live a moral life. In this chapter, Humanae Vitae will be placed primarily within the context of the teaching on marriage conveyed through Casti Connubii (1930) and Gaudium et Spes (1965). These documents, of course, are not the only place to look for the<br>

  Abstract: The neglect by philosophers and theologians of the issue of contraception is not easily explained in light of the complexity of the issue and the magnitude of the question. In light of the Church’s perpetual condemnation of contraception, it would seem that Catholic philosophers and theologians would have a special impetus for considering the issue. This book has attempted to assess the status of the question: It has sought to place the Church’s condemnation within the context of its teaching on marriage and to show how it draws on principles fundamental to Catholic moral teaching. It claims that the challenges<br>

  Abstract: No question is foreign to metaphysics, Bruaire contends, because metaphysics deals with that most important issue which is presupposed in all the other disciplines.¹ Philosophy addresses the decisive, eternal question: “what is being?”² Yet, according to Bruaire, to ask about “that which is” is to pose the question concerning the nature of the principle that sustains whatever exists, namely, the absolute, which in theological terms is called God.³ This is philosophy’s inevitable prejudice: every philosophy has as its object the absolute, as Schelling stated.⁴ Bruaire considers that the question of the absolute is the question that must be confronted, because<br>

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: It is not at all easy to free human awareness from the captivating idea that the human being can account for his own existence without coming to terms with the question of his own origin. The anthropological turn of modernity, for the sake of pursuing more pressing matters or more deceivingly fundamental issues, presumed that severing the question of God from the inquiry into the human being’s own identity would give wings to the quest for knowledge. Instead, as postmodernity witnesses, this too-often rated “successful” revolution has yielded a radical dissolution of any unifying principle and thus, of man himself.<br>

  Abstract: The philosophical tradition of just war has concentrated on two questions. First, what, if any, are the legitimate reasons for engaging in war (

The topic of this chapter, which is the changed scope of the principle of nonintervention, is rooted in the tradition of ius ad bellum.

  CHAPTER THREE  The Historical Background of Kant’s General Logic from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851gx">Necessity and Possibility</a><br>
  Abstract: I have tried to show up to this point that Kant conceives of general logic as a set of universal and necessary rules for the possibility of thought, or as a set of minimal necessary conditions for ascribing rationality to an agent (focusing, up to this point, on the principle of non-contradiction). Such a conception contrasts with contemporary notions of formal, mathematical, or symbolic logic: rather as an attempt to identify those conditions that must hold for the possibility of thought, such conditions must hold a fortiori for any specific model of thought, including axiomatic treatments of logic and standard<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Kant and Contemporary Philosophy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851gx">Necessity and Possibility</a><br>
  Abstract: If we construe Kant’s general logic in the way I have urged in previous chapters, we see emerging a conception of logic that functions as a minimal-constraint model of rationality. In short, for an agent to be regarded 
                  as an agent—or for ourselves to regard ourselves as agents—we must conform to some set of rules for thought to qualify as thought. In Kantian terms, for a judgment in general to be possible, it must conform to a set of rules, and I have focused here on the principle of noncontradiction as exemplary of such a rule. When we<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  The Modesty of the Critical Philosophy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851gx">Necessity and Possibility</a><br>
  Abstract: It is not uncommon in introductory philosophy courses to receive a picture of Kant that paints him as a paradigmatic old-fashioned, detached Prussian scholar, whose walks were so predictable that the residents of Königsberg could set their clocks by them, and whose life passed as the most regular of regular verbs. Such an image is reinforced by the overwhelming attention to what might be called the “positive” dimension of Kant’s philosophy, for example, the Transcendental Analytic. There we find obscure arguments couched in arcane, inscrutable terminology, as well as intricate, elaborate proofs of synthetic a priori concepts and principles. All<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851jw">The One, the Many, and the Trinity</a><br>
  Abstract: I have argued that process thought in general and Bracken’s theology in particular simultaneously generate the so-called problem of the one and the many and are unable to solve it, because they relegate metaphysics, including the metaphysics of ultimate reality, to principles that have classically been understood as applying to created reality only. Before examining how classical theism might respond to the problem of the one and the many with reference to the distinction between finite and transcendent being, or the Creator-creature distinction, I will point to ways in which it appears that process thinkers themselves do not avoid this<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we discussed the early church’s experience of the Word as the principle of the endowment of grace, and of the Spirit as the principle of its reception. We then reflected on the Spirit within the triune life of God, and proposed analogies for understanding the Spirit as the Spirit of Reception. The nature and mission of God determines the nature and mission of the church. The church is called to be an icon of the Trinity.¹ In this chapter we move to a more specific discussion of the role of the Spirit in the economy of<br>

  CHAPTER 3  The Holy Spirit and a Sense for the Faith from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Since faith is the reception of revelation, at the heart of the nature of the church as a community of reception is its nature as a community 
                  of faith. Faith is a gift of the Holy Spirit which has two fundamental dimensions: faith as believing, i.e., as a personal response to God’s loving initiative (fides qua creditur), and faith as beliefs and assent to beliefs, i.e., as an affirmative response to the content of what has been revealed (fides quae creditur). As the principle of reception, the Holy Spirit is at work in both these dimensions of faith’s reception of<br>

  CHAPTER 7  The Threefold Teaching Office of the Church from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: The mission of the church is to tradition faithfully the reality it has received: God’s self-giving in Jesus Christ, made possible through the Holy Spirit, the principle of that gift’s reception. In the church’s fulfillment of that mission, the rubric of the “three offices of Christ” names three specific, albeit overlapping dimensions of church life. The specific “teaching office” is but one dimension. However, since it is in its treatment of the teaching office that

  Epilogue: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: The primary

  Author(s) Yengoyan Aram A.<br>
  Abstract: This paper develops two major themes of Mandaya social structure which operate at different levels of social and political activity. One of these principles or themes is the structure of hierarchy or precedence which operates primarily at the political level of leadership and warfare as it articulates the domination of the centre or points of origin to the periphery of social life. In this context the dominant expression of precedence is based on the political role of the 
                  bagani (the warrior class) and the various sub-units of political authority which traditionally inhabited the lands of the Mandaya. The second theme<br>

  Author(s) Bulbeck F. David<br>
  Abstract: The traditional political systems of the Malay and Bugis worlds, northern Sumatra and Java, produced a high frequency of female rulers by world standards (Reid 1988:169-172). Nonetheless the élite titles in these systems still tended to be inherited patrilineally even though very different descent principles, usually bilateral but even matrilineal, operated within society as a whole (e.g. Gullick 1958; Palmier 1969; de Josselin de Jong 1980:10; Millar 1989:25). Fox observes that élite patrilinealism within a bilateral system is only one variant, albeit the most common, of a widespread tendency for Austronesian élites to claim a separate origin from commoners and<br>

  Abstract: In the closing years of the twentieth century, debates in Australia about Indigenous institutions of common property ownership and management are inseparable from the highly political issues of Native Title. In this chapter I intend to move beyond debates about the politics of land tenure and toward an analysis of a dynamic jurisprudence of duty in which responsibilities and rights are considered together. I will examine totemism as a common property institution for long-term ecological management.

  CHAPTER 1  Feminist Theological Hermeneutics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt3q4">Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Good</a><br>
  Abstract: Hermeneutical theology is a distinct approach to theology. Hermeneutics itself is the science of interpretation.¹ Since Christianity is a textually based religion shaped by and oriented around a particular set of symbols, Christian theology needs to reinterpret its significant doctrines, texts,² and symbols for each new generation and within each new culture in which it emerges. Such interpretation is necessary for several reasons: on anthropological grounds, in light of the principle of analogy, because of the nature of foundational documents themselves, and, finally, in light of the hermeneutics of suspicion.³<br>

  Abstract: The process of hermeneutical retrieval presupposes that the one who is attempting the retrieval is dealing adequately and fairly with the classic text, doctrine, or principle in question. While this is obvious, it offers a challenge to the one who would engage in a process of retrieval. A worthy process of retrieval demands that the classic element be dealt with in as balanced a manner as possible, without giving up the integrity of the process by highlighting only those aspects of the classic element that one either endorses or reviles.

It includes a consideration of the text or tradition using appropriate analytical tools, as well as the next and necessary step into praxis. When one engages in a critical assessment of significant aspects of Aquinas’s principle of the common good, such as his anthropology, one must attend to the contributions that Aquinas’s work can make 
                  to contemporary scholarship: for example, Aquinas’s conception of the person contributes to a fuller description of the human person suggested by Martha Nussbaum’s functioning capabilities. Without openness to a mutual correlation of<br>

  Abstract: Now that we have retrieved Aquinas’s principle of the common good through the proposed feminist hermeneutics, we should inquire about its significance for the community. What is this retrieved principle capable of? What does it offer the human community? On the one hand, the distinction between fundamental ethics and applied ethics ought to be left intact; certainly the two moments in ethics are distinct and should not be blurred into one another, nor should one be reduced to the other. On the other hand, from several quarters we find an expectation if not a demand that theoretical considerations be extended<br>

  Abstract: The principle of the common good holds considerable promise for improving life both in American society and globally, particularly when it is reinterpreted through the lens of women’s experience. It has become commonplace today to recognize that a significant cultural blinder in the United States is individualism, and that nation-states internationally are all too often guided by narrow national interests rather than what is best for the global community. The retrieved notion of the common good can serve as a necessary corrective, whether discussing health care policy, as this book has done, or other domestic social issues such as welfare<br>

  Book Title: The Sexual Person-Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawler Michael G.<br>
  Abstract: Two principles capture the essence of the official Catholic position on the morality of sexuality: first, that any human genital act must occur within the framework of heterosexual marriage; second, each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics.

  Chapter Eight  Artificial Reproductive Technologies from:

  Abstract: In the 1950s the marketing of effective oral contraceptives made it possible to have sexual intercourse without reproduction; in the 1980s the marketing of artificial reproductive technologies (ARTs) made it possible to reproduce without having sexual intercourse. The Catholic Magisterium argues against the morality of both oral contraceptives and ARTs on the basis of its principle of the inseparability of the unitive and procreative meanings of sexual intercourse.

  Book Title: The Sexual Person-Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawler Michael G.<br>
  Abstract: Two principles capture the essence of the official Catholic position on the morality of sexuality: first, that any human genital act must occur within the framework of heterosexual marriage; second, each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics. While some documents from Vatican II, like
      Gaudium et spes("the marital act promotes self-giving by which spouses enrich each other"), gave hope for a renewed understanding of sexuality, the church has not carried out the full implications of this approach. In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality.The Sexual Persondraws historically, methodologically, and anthropologically from the best of Catholic tradition and provides a context for current theological debates between traditionalists and revisionists regarding marriage, cohabitation, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and what it means to be human.

  Abstract: Freud’s colossal prejudices, in Wittgenstein’s view, all stem from three underlying assumptions of Freudian theory which he implicitly or explicitly contests. The first of these is psychic determinism, which Freud himself regularly presented as a constitutive preconception that could not be questioned. As Sulloway writes: “Freud’s entire life’s work in science was characterized by an abiding faith in the notion that all vital phenomena, including psychical ones, are rigidly and lawfully determined by the principle of cause and effect” (

  Author(s) GREENBERG CLEMENT<br>
  Abstract: The latest abstract painting offends many people, among whom are more than a few who accept the abstract in art in principle. New painting (sculpture is a different question) still provokes scandal when little that is new in literature or even music appears to do so any longer. This may be explained by the very slowness of painting’s evolution as a modernist art. Though it started on its “modernization” earlier perhaps than the other arts, it has turned out to have a greater number of 
                  expendable conventions imbedded in it, or these at least have proven harder to isolate and<br>

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bm6t">Passage to Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: The idea of modernity has long attracted critical attention. Many hold its principles responsible for various ills that threaten to drain our culture of meaning and purpose. Those charges presuppose that we know how to distinguish the
                  modernfrom thepremodern. Most critics, however, finding it unnecessary to be precise on this issue, remain satisfied with reversing the praise that earlier generations showered upon an allegedly modern mode of thinking and acting. While they exalted rational objectivity, moral tolerance, and individual choice as cultural absolutes, we now regard these principles with some suspicion. Undoubtedly there are good reasons to distrust<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bm6t">Passage to Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: Early Greek philosophy defined the terms in which Western thought was to formulate transcendence. The Ionian search for a ground of nature beyond its appearance as well as the Pythagorean distinction between a principle of intelligibility and the reality it renders intelligible made the relation from the more fundamental to the less fundamental an unavoidable issue. Classical Greek philosophy eventually resolved it by means of the form principle. The form resided within the appearing objects of which it constituted the intelligible essence, yet as determining factor it also surpassed them. In his dialogue

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: Modernity is an
                     eventthat has transformed the relation between the cosmos, its transcendent source, and its human interpreter. To explain this as the outcome of historical precedents is to ignore its most significant quality—namely, its success in rendering all rival views of the real obsolete. Its innovative power made modernity, which began as a local Western phenomenon, a universal project capable of forcing its theoretical and practical principles on all but the most isolated civilizations. “Modern” has become the predicate of a unified world culture.<br>

                  ars historica,as in Pierre Droit de Gaillard’s declaration that “all disciplines take their sources and the basis of their principles from history, as from an overflowing fountain.”² The difference was Luther’s pious addition,<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: Almost fifty years ago, as a young student at the University of Chicago, I received my preliminary initiation into the erotic mysteries of the Platonic dialogues from an ambiguous foreign prophet named Leo Strauss. As I was no Socrates and Strauss no Diotima, this initiation could not be entirely satisfactory. I had no difficulty in accepting Strauss’s central hermeneutical principle that the key to Plato’s teaching is the dialogue-form itself. What could be more self-evident than that Plato wrote dramas rather than treatises (albeit somewhat eccentric, not to say occasionally boring dramas like the

  Abstract: "Accessible yet challenging, this book will be the indispensable introductory text for semiotics-indeed for any theoretical course in the humanities and social sciences that deals with the theory of these disciplines."-
      Choice"The book offers . . . a clutch of examples of semiotics usefully and intelligently applied, which Schole's patient, cheerful tone and his resolutely concrete vocabulary manage to combine into a breezily informative American confection."-Terence Hawkes,Times Literary Supplement"This critique demonstrates once more that Scholes . . . is one of the most authoritative scholars in the field of semiotics."-The Antioch Review"[Scholes] applies the range of semiotic theory to a series of other texts-poems, stories, films, a scene from a play, bumper stickers, even a part of the human anatomy. . . . When we finish this text (which includes a useful glossary and descriptive bibliography), we feel that we have learned the basic principles of semiotics and can apply them in our teaching and criticism; as a bonus, we gain many new insights into familiar texts."-Richard Pearce,Novel"[Scholes] is among our best interpreters of literary theory. . . . He provides not only an argument for semiotics but an informed criticism of it as well."-Martin Green,The Literary Review<br>

  Book Title: On the Nature of Consciousness-Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUNT HARRY T.<br>
  Abstract: What is the relation between mystical experience and ordinary consciousness, between the principles of modern physics and the patterns of perception in all moving creatures, between our human self-consciousness and the more primary sentience of protozoa? This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuro-psychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various "new age" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.<br>

  13  Consciousness as Space: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: A number of investigators from both sides of the interface between physical theory and consciousness have called attention to some intriguing parallels between various aspects of modern physics and eastern meditative traditions (Bohm, 1980; Capra, 1975; LeShan, 1969; Grof, 1980; Wallace, 1986; Wolf, 1990). Vedanta and aspects of Buddhism picture a “unified field” comprising physical reality and consciousness, both of them based on minute particle energies in vibration. The difference, of course, is that even the most speculative of physicists, who understand consciousness as a subatomic quantum reality, are nonetheless deriving mind from the principles of the physical universe.

King’s Coyote—denizen of a vast number of American Indian stories including King’s novel, Green Grass, Running Water—wanders through each of the works in the collection and even leaves “Coyote tracks,” in the form of graphic images, throughout the white spaces in the text that conventionally separate one story from another.

  Abstract: In 1935, Roman Jakobson noted that all art is influenced by an overarching principle, what the Russian Formalists called the “dominant” (1971 : 82), a structuring orientation characterizing a work or even an entire epoch. Although a narrative may have many functions and embody several forms, an internal hierarchy exists which determines the relative value of its components. The dominant of poetic language is the aesthetic function—its form. Poetry is oriented toward the sign, while prose narrative is directed toward the referent.¹ “Poetic evolution,” says Jakobson, “is a shift in this hierarchy.”<br>

  Abstract: The history of the humanities, or

Therefore, one may fruitfully look for models or examples in the history of the natural sciences in order to avoid reinventing the wheel, or running into difficulties that have already been encountered elsewhere, and perhaps even solved. There are also more principled reasons, however, for thematizing the rise of a strict disciplinary opposition between the humanities and the natural sciences, an opposition which is more recent and less stable than one might think.

  Book Title: The Bioregional Imagination-Literature, Ecology, and Place<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLER EZRA<br>
  Abstract: Bioregionalism is an innovative way of thinking about place and planet from an ecological perspective. Although bioregional ideas occur regularly in ecocritical writing, until now no systematic effort has been made to outline the principles of bioregional literary criticism and to use it as a way to read, write, understand, and teach literature. The twenty-four original essays here are written by an outstanding selection of international scholars. The range of bioregions covered is global and includes such diverse places as British Columbia's Meldrum Creek and Italy's Po River Valley, the Arctic and the Outback. There are even forays into cyberspace and outer space. In their comprehensive introduction, the editors map the terrain of the bioregional movement, including its history and potential to inspire and invigorate place-based and environmental literary criticism. Responding to bioregional tenets, this volume is divided into four sections. The essays in the "Reinhabiting" section narrate experiments in living-in-place and restoring damaged environments. The "Rereading" essays practice bioregional literary criticism, both by examining texts with strong ties to bioregional paradigms and by opening other, less-obvious texts to bioregional analysis. In "Reimagining," the essays push bioregionalism to evolve-by expanding its corpus of texts, coupling its perspectives with other approaches, or challenging its core constructs. Essays in the "Renewal" section address bioregional pedagogy, beginning with local habitat studies and concluding with musings about the Internet. In response to the environmental crisis, we must reimagine our relationship to the places we inhabit. This volume shows how literature and literary studies are fundamental tools to such a reimagining.<br>

  Book Title: The King James Version at 400-Assessing Its Genius as Bible Translation and Its Literary Influence<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Towner Philip H.<br>
  Abstract: In this collection of essays, thirty scholars from diverse disciplines offer their unique perspectives on the genius of the King James Version, a translation whose 400th anniversary was recently celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. While avoiding nostalgia and hagiography, each author clearly appreciates the monumental, formative role the KJV has had on religious and civil life on both sides of the Atlantic (and beyond) as well as on the English language itself. In part 1 the essayists look at the KJV in its historical contexts—the politics and rapid language growth of the era, the emerging printing and travel industries, and the way women are depicted in the text (and later feminist responses to such depictions). Part 2 takes a closer look at the KJV as a translation and the powerful precedents it set for all translations to follow, with the essayists exploring the translators’ principles and processes (with close examinations of “Bancroft’s Rules" and the Prefaces), assessing later revisions of the text, and reviewing the translation’s influence on the English language, textual criticism, and the practice of translation in Jewish and Chinese contexts. Part 3 looks at the various ways the KJV has impacted the English language and literature, the practice of religion (including within the African American and Eastern Orthodox churches), and the broader culture. The contributors are Robert Alter, C. Clifton Black, David G. Burke, Richard A. Burridge, David J. A. Clines, Simon Crisp, David J. Davis, James D. G. Dunn, Lori Anne Ferrell, Leonard J.

  Abstract: Traditionally, metaphysics searches for essences, but the post-metaphysical quest leans more toward potentials. Martin Heidegger puts it this way: “Higher than actuality lies
                  possibility.” Metaphysics as a branch of philosophy studies the nature of being and beings, existence, time, space, movement, and causality. It also involves underlying principles and theories that form the basis of a particular field of knowledge. Heidegger conceived the primary task of metaphysics as the clarification ofbeingin his book on phenomenological metaphysics,Being and Time. In the analysis of being, he holds that phenomenology and ontology characterize philosophy itself, and that we can best<br>

  Abstract: Gustav Gustavovich Shpet (1879-1937) has emerged as one of the most prominent Russian philosophers of the twentieth century. The principle promoter of Husserlian phenomenology, at the same time creatively modifying Husserl and at times departing from him, Shpet was also an early advocate of hermeneutics. He left behind seminal work spanning philosophy, aesthetics, psychology, literary and theater theory, and the history of Russian thought. Significantly, many of his concerns anticipate preoccupations that have dominated the discourses of cultural theory and the philosophy of language over the last few decades.<br>

Much of the value of Shpet's contribution to philosophy derives from his introduction of phenomenology into his own country. But even though he knowingly proposed certain significant modifications to Husserl's thought, an examination of some of his major writings on language and aesthetics leads one to suspect that Shpet, apparently without knowing it, gave his own slant to those parts that he thought he was merely interpreting and passing on. Both the witting and the<br>

  Semiotics in Voloshinov and Shpet from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq645">Gustav Shpet's Contribution to Philosophy and Cutlural Theory</a><br>
  Author(s) Radunović Dušan<br>
  Abstract: The conceptual foundations of Gustav Shpet's general semasiology and Valentin Voloshinov's principle of dialogic speech interaction have rarely been considered from a comparative perspective. This article purports to draw critical attention to the partly convergent, partly divergent trajectories that these two thinkers followed in their approach to language. Whereas the two methodologies and discursive practices may not appear commensurable on the surface, there emerge beneath important philosophical convergences between Shpet and Voloshinov. Notwithstanding the fact that the two thinkers developed their views on language in different directions, coextensive philosophical concerns and common intellectual backgrounds provide a certain justification for a<br>

  Author(s) Yōtaku Bankei<br>
  Abstract: Bankei was a Zen monk of the Rinzai School who, after studying with both Japanese and immigrant Chinese Zen masters, initially settled into a quiet life away from the major cities, tending to the spiritual needs of his local community. But in his fifties he was invited to preside over major teaching monasteries in Kyoto and Edo (later Tokyo) and quickly became a famed master of many in both metropolitan areas. Bankei is famous for his teaching of what he called the unborn mind. Humans determine or significantly impact the nature of their own reality by their attention. This principle<br>

  DEMOCRACY AND JUSTICE: PRESUPPOSITIONS AND IMPLICATIONS from:

  Author(s) Krishna Daya<br>
  Abstract: The demand for “equality” may be said to lie at the very roots of both democracy and justice. The one pertains to the realm of the political, while the other belongs to the legal domain. Yet, as everybody knows, the realm of politics is the realm of power, which is essentially asymmetrical in nature, and the realm of law is only a realm which legitimates existing inequalities. But if, in principle, not everyone can be equal in the political realm, then what is involved in the pursuit of “democracy”—which is prescribed as the ideal political form of government by<br>

  Abstract: As imperial designs on the world expanded their scope in the latter half of the eighteenth century, and more of the earth’s surface was subjected to scientific description, so geographical knowledge also spread. This enlarged field of facts did not, though, exercise any great influence over the way geographers conceived of the foundations of their discipline. Their aim remained much the same: to use the tools of inductive reasoning to reduce the variety of the earth’s natural features to certain universal principles. Movement was a prerequisite of geographical knowledge. But it formed no part of geography’s representation of the world.<br>

  Author(s) Blank Andreas<br>
  Abstract: In “The Interpretation of Philosophical Texts,” Nicholas Rescher outlines a coherentist theory of textual interpretation. At the heart of his theory lies an idea that he calls the “Principle of Normativity,” according to which “the better (the more smoothly and coherently) an interpretation fits a text into its wider context, the better it is as an interpretation.” The principle implies that, as Rescher puts it, interpretations are not “born equal.” Although there can be several initially plausible interpretations of a given passage, these interpretations can be evaluated according to the degree to which they maximize contextual coherence.

  Abstract: In this article an instrumentalist conception of action interpretation will be developed. This conception shall be suitable for interpreting moral actions as well as other actions. The approach’s instrumentalism consists in the fact that interpretations here are conceived as means for fulfilling a certain function, in particular for providing a certain type of information about the action. After these preliminary remarks it will be explained which kind of information we expect from action interpretations (section 1). In the subsequent section it will be discussed which model of action and action interpretation in principle could provide this information (section 2). In<br>

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>

  Abstract: Authored by legal practitioners, activists, and theorists in addition to theologians and ethicists, the essays collected here are informed by timeless principles, and yet they could not be timelier. The trend in sentencing moves toward an increased severity, and the number of incarcerated people in the United States is at an all-time high. In the half-decade since 9/11, moreover, homeland security has established itself as a permanent fixture in our lives. In this atmosphere, the current volume seeks initially to clarify how justice and mercy intertwine in relation to a number of issues, such as rehabilitation, the death penalty, domestic violence, and war crimes. Exploring the legal, philosophical, and theological grounds for mercy in our courts, the discussion then moves to the practical ways in which mercy may be implemented.<br>

As traditionally constituted, the principles of mimesis are here immediately violated; instead of art being inferior to nature, the art of the first terrace is such that it puts nature to shame: “non pur Policleto,<br>

  Abstract: Brahms, who emerged from the circles of the Romantics, embodies the enduring principle of the Romantic tendency: the principle of mixed moods and rapid movement in the life of the emotions. But Brahms surpasses all previous representatives of musical Romanticism in the versatility of his spirit, acquired in the course of a wonderfully purposeful and energetic development, and in the objectivity, stringency, and diversity of his style. Among all the symphonic composers of our century, Brahms is the only one who equals Beethoven in the logic and economy of his structure, the unbroken expansiveness of his material and creations, and<br>

What is the principle that aggregates them, that makes us speak of them as one, a collective unit, “the dead”? And how does this oneness of the dead reflect on humans in general, currently not one but perhaps needing to be?

  Author(s) MILLER RICHARD B.<br>
  Abstract: Christians began to think systematically about the ethics of land, territory, and boundaries within a specific set of historical circumstances. European claims to dominion in the New World during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries generated a new range of questions in moral theology for Catholics and Protestants alike, theology developed most notably by Cajetan, Vitoria, Soto, Suarez, Molina, Las Casas, Gentili, and Grotius. Yet these authors did not generate normative principles for addressing questions of dominion and boundaries
                  de novo; they drew on a tradition of categories, distinctions, and concrete practices that give substance to the Christian imagination regarding political<br>

  Author(s) SKILLEN JAMES W.<br>
  Abstract: David Little builds his case for a ʺweak theoryʺ of ethical pluralism largely on the basis of what he calls ʺconscientious individualism.ʺ In response, I would like to argue that something broader and deeper than conscientious individualism is needed to account for both the diversity of ethical responsibilities that humans bear and the diverse, often incompatible ways they exercise those responsibilities. By enlarging and strengthening the normative basis, I believe it is possible to develop a strong, principled argument for pluralism, which is not the same as a defense of ethical relativism.<br>

  Abstract: Philosophers are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to understanding politics, and it is a disadvantage that results from the very peculiarity of their special vocation and training. From almost the very beginning of its existence as a distinct activity, Western philosophy has been committed to certain principles of at least minimal self-awareness, clarity, coherence, and consistency of thought, speech, valuation, and action. Socrates, who notoriously took no part in city politics beyond what was strictly required of him by his obligations as a citizen, also started philosophy down the path of exhortation to

  Abstract: In the Wednesday catecheses, John Paul II describes and analyzes the human body according to the principles of an adequate anthropology. As shown in the previous chapter, the pope explains the concept of an adequate anthropology as “an understanding and interpretation of man in what is essentially human.”¹ Through a phenomenological concentration on what is characteristic to man—subjectivity, an experience of self, and self-reflection—an adequate anthropology opposes empiricist anthropological reductionism that “reduces man to ‘the world’” and understands man only “with the categories taken from the ‘world,’ that is, from the visible totality of bodies.”²<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  Poetic Argument from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zt2s">Poetic Argument</a><br>
  Abstract: This book is a defence of reason in poetry. It does not follow the “moralistic” and “absolutist” principles proposed by Yvor Winters in
                  In Defense of Reason; it is closer to the cautionary critique of avant-garde “unreality” offered more recently by Gerald Graff inLiterature Against Itself. My main purpose is to trace the fate of reason as it engages in and is challenged by the arguments of modernist poetry. Such poetry argues with itself, within itself, with its resources, with its author, and with its readers. As I intend to show, it grows argumentative by making paradoxical demands of<br>

  Something Paradoxical from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: Critics of the novel find paradox to be “a principle of the genre” and note the frequency with which the romances speak of situations as “new and strange” (
                  kainos) or “against reason” (paralogos), or “unthought of” (adokētos) (Heiserman 1977, 77 and 226 n. 4). Techniques of paradox enrich these stories at all levels of plot, imagery and wordplay. Paradox is especially essential to their emotional texture. This can surprise no one familiar with the lyric precedents of erotic fiction. “I’m crazy! I’m not crazy! I’m in love! I’m not in love!” said Anakreon in the sixth century b.c. (413PMG).<br>

If Cooper was the defender of social distinction and filial piety, Emerson has long been labeled a social radical and the decrier of pious retrospection.

  Book Title: History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Karl Morrison discusses historical writing at a turning point in European culture: the so-called Renaissance of the twelfth century. Why do texts considered at that time to be masterpieces seem now to be fragmentary and full of contradictions? Morrison maintains that the answer comes from ideas about art. Viewing histories as artifacts made according to the same aesthetic principles as paintings and theater, he shows that twelfth-century authors and audiences found unity not in what the reason read in a text but in what the imagination read into it: they prized visual over verbal imagination and employed a circular, or nuclear, spectator-centered perspective cast aside in the Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<br>

  Abstract: If the discussion at the end of the preceding chapter gradually began to emphasize a curious hybrid of traditionally discrete discourses—the historical and the eschatological—my reasons for yoking such unlikely categories was neither the example of Benjamin’s “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” nor the desire to provide an intermediate stage between a section devoted to

  Abstract: Blattberg's is a genuinely original philosophical voice. The essays collected here discuss how to re-conceive the political spectrum, where "deliberative deomocrats" go wrong, why human rights language is tragically counterproductive, how nationalism is not really secular, how many nations should share a single state, a new approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and why Canada might have something to teach about the "war on terror." We also learn about the right way to deny a role to principles in ethics, how to distinguish between the good and the beautiful, the way humor works, the rabbinic nature of modernism, the difference between good, bad, great, and evil, why Plato's dialogues are not really dialogues, and why most philosophers are actually artists.<br>

  Abstract: Jonathan Dancy has described his

Dancy’s basic aim is to provide an alternative to those mainstream, principlesbased approaches to ethics, which is why a great deal of his energy in this and previous works has been devoted to criticizing that mainstream. My critique here, however, is different in that it comes from “the other side,” so to speak, for I wish to argue that Dancy’s alternative does not take us far enough.<br>

The essays collected here discuss how to re-conceive the political spectrum, where "deliberative deomocrats" go wrong, why human rights language is tragically counterproductive, how nationalism is not really secular, how many nations should share a single state, a new approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and why Canada might have something to teach about the "war on terror." We also learn about the right way to deny a role to principles in ethics, how to distinguish between the good and the beautiful, the way humor works, the rabbinic nature of modernism, the difference between good, bad, great, and evil, why Plato's dialogues are not really dialogues, and why most philosophers are actually artists.<br>

  Abstract: Jonathan Dancy has described his
                     Ethics without Principlesas the culmination of twenty-five years of work, and indeed it is a major statement by a leading contemporary moral philosopher. Dancy’s basic aim is to provide an alternative to those mainstream, principlesbased approaches to ethics, which is why a great deal of his energy in this and previous works has been devoted to criticizing that mainstream. My critique here, however, is different in that it comes from “the other side,” so to speak, for I wish to argue that Dancy’s alternative does not take us far enough.<br>

  Book Title: Karl Polanyi on Ethics and Economics-Foreword by Marguerite Mendell<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Baum Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Exploring Polanyi's lesser-known works as well as The Great Transformation, Baum provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Polanyi's thought. He examines Polanyi's interpretation of modern economic and social history, clarifies the ethical presuppositions present in Polanyi's work, and addresses how Polanyi's understanding of the relation between ethics and economics touches on many issues relevant to the contemporary debate about the world's economic future. Baum argues that we should look to Polanyi's understanding of modern capitalism to reinstate the social discourse and, in political practice, the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. He points to examples, both in Canada and abroad, of attempts to formulate alternative models of economic development and to create new forms of institutional and cultural intervention.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0sq9">The Sense of the Universe</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we analyze the general epistemological conditions for knowability and explicability of the universe as a whole. Both knowability and explicability imply an anthropological dimension in cosmology, for both these requirements have human origin: to speculate about the universe one must experience its presence through the instantaneous synthesis associated with conscious life. It is argued that the cosmological principle acts as reduction of this synthesis to a mental spatial uniformity of the universe. However, the contingent facticity of the cosmological principle leads to the necessity of its explication in terms of generative steps required to grasp the sense<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0sq9">The Sense of the Universe</a><br>
  Abstract: Our intention now is to provide a concise and symbolic (graphical) description of the universe as a whole in order to explicate an epistemological meaning of such a description, in particular its dependence upon some irreducible beliefs that make this description possible. To do this we need to give a brief overview of the major methodological presumption in cosmology, namely the cosmological principle.¹ Since we cannot empirically verify the statistics of distribution of matter from other locations in space we have to speculate on the overall distribution of matter in the universe, appealing to philosophical and hence physically untestable assumptions.<br>

  Abstract: It is common knowledge among members of the Evangelical Pentecostal Church (EPC) in Valparaíso, Chile, that good things only happen when God makes them happen. A fundamental theological principle in this church is an understanding of human powerlessness and total dependence upon an almighty God as the source of all good things. According to Anthony Giddens, distinguishing features of modernity include a basic trust in the transformative potential of human agency and social institutions as well as new perceptions of determination and ambiguity that leave little room for religious cosmologies (1994: 36).

  Author(s) Pan Tianshu<br>
  Abstract: Throughout most of Chinese history, males—and especially sons—have comprised the preferred social category in which parents strove to develop emotional and ethical obligation. This relationship has constituted the fundamental value orientation by which Chinese society has traditionally organized itself. But the 1949 communist transformation of society, especially urban life, profoundly altered the parent-son dyad, and in its place the parent-daughter bond became increasingly paramount. Even in the countryside, where the parent-son relationship and the patrilineal principle remained sociological constants, a transformation took place by the late twentieth century. Increasingly, urbanites and some rural residents (Shi 2009; Yan 2003)<br>

  Abstract: In more than one article (Depaepe, 1998c; Depaepe, Simon & Van Gorp, 2003; Depaepe & Van Gorp, 2003), we have pointed out that, for an appreciation of the educational mentality and reality of the past, the study of the lesser stars in the educational firmament is more – or at least just as – important as that of the great figures.

  Abstract: The Belgian Constitutional Court holds an ambiguous position towards European law. Whereas, generally, it has recognized its power to review the conformity of a legislative act approving a treaty with the Constitution, it also deploys these treaties, and more broadly European law as enshrined in treaties and other instruments, to decide upon the constitutionality of other laws. Especially in reviews that rely upon the constitutional principle of non-discrimination, European law can play an important role, providing content to that principle.<br>

But what does it mean to say that there is a tradition of modern justice? And what are its insufficiencies?

  Abstract: Americans seem confident in the mythical notion that the United States is a free nation dedicated to reproducing the principles of equality, justice, and democracy. What has been ignored in this delusional view is the growing rise of an expanded national security state since 2001,¹ and an attack on individual rights that suggests the United States has more in common with authoritarian regimes like China and Iran “than anyone may like to admit.”² I want to address this seemingly untenable notion that the United States has become a breeding ground for authoritarianism by focusing on four fundamentalisms: market fundamentalism, religious<br>

  Abstract: One of the central issues in the relationship of politics and religion is the status, scope, and limits of religious toleration. Although the principle of toleration is generally taken for granted by most Americans in an almost ritualistic fashion, they tend to ignore the controversial character of the principle itself: what it means, how it is to be applied, what its limitations are, and, in general, how it is grounded in moral and political philosophy. When asked about the moral basis of toleration the general answer is that toleration comes from pluralism, and ours is a pluralistic society. Q.E.D. It<br>

  Abstract: As Samuel Palmer recognized already in 1812, nineteenth-century Christianity in England was both united and divided.¹ Though Christian churches held most of the central teachings of Christianity in common, they diverged significantly in polity, theology, and liturgy. For the ordinary churchgoing Christian, denominational divergence emerged most obviously not in theological discussions, seminary debates, or circulated writings but in the public worship service, where communal worship practices shaped and bespoke religious principle. True, the basic elements of Christian liturgy—Scripture reading, singing, prayer, sermon, sacrament—appeared in almost all worship services, of whatever denomination; but as Palmer points out, how these<br>

Is the “Latino/a-ness” of an interpretation defined by the personal identity (howsoever defined) of the interpreter? Or is it a matter of how Latino/a biblical interpretation is practiced—that is, are there certain principles, sources, methods (reading strategies), or aims that make some biblical interpretations Latino/a and others not? In this concluding reflection it is not my intention to define Latino/a biblical interpretation in a rigid way,<br>

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

There they reached an accord in principle that would allow Quebec to rejoin the “Canadian constitutional fold,” as the

                  Theory of Justice(1971), liberal-communitarian critics have placed firmly on the agenda the notion that individual identity is partly constituted by the cultural community in which one is born and educated.

Postmodernism, too, has had a significant impact with its critique of the one-sided universalism typically associated with ‘the Enlightenment,’ as<br>

  Abstract: With the main tenets of Herder’s moral and political thought now outlined, this chapter applies the central principles of his ontology and his theories of language and culture to a number of issues that have arisen in contemporary political theory with respect to immigrant societies and long-standing communities. It is difficult to dispute that most states in the modern world are multi-cultural in a descriptive sense.¹ Despite the centralizing and homogenizing cultural policies of the modern ‘nation-state’ documented by scholars of nationalism like Gellner, many cultural minorities have been remarkably resilient. Typically states are as they were under the dynastic<br>

Such host capacity² accounts of the human struggle both with defining humanity so as not to exclude some of those least able to raise their voices in protest and also with the subtleties of an anthropocentrism from which they consider themselves freed.

  Author(s) Cronin Ciaran<br>
  Abstract: The adjective ‘unconscious’ designates a quality that can be found in psychical processes such as imagining, remembering, thinking, feeling, desiring, wishing and acting. The processes which exhibit this quality differ from those with the quality ‘conscious’ in that the former are not present in the current field of consciousness but nevertheless remain psychologically effective, indeed, often far more so than the processes which have the quality of being conscious. The substantive, the ‘unconscious’, expresses the fact that psychological phenomena are not confined in principle to conscious experiences but are profoundly shaped by unconscious forces. In psychoanalysis, this concept also designates<br>

The problem is that several contributors have already shown perfectly the principles that guide my approach to cinema and what consequences follow from them. Since I have no reason to contradict them and no wish to repeat them, the only path remaining to me is one of transposition. They have gone about things in an orderly way and argued with a subtlety that leaves nothing to be desired. It remains to me to punctuate in a crude and disorderly way the points that they have brought to light.<br>

  Abstract: Between February and April 1848, the conservative order which had dominated Europe since the fall of Napoleon in 1815 was felled by the hammer-blows of revolution across the continent. The revolutions swept liberal governments to power, tasked with forging a new political order based on the principles of civil rights and parliamentary government. By the end of 1849, all the revolutions had collapsed and the short and violent European experiment in liberal (and, in some countries, democratic) politics was over. For the history of democracy, the fascination of 1848 lies in the variety of democratic forms that emerged in such<br>

  Author(s) Roberts Peri<br>
  Abstract: Constructivism in political theory is opposed to both scepticism and foundationalism. Against the sceptic the constructivist hopes to defend the objectivity of at least some political principles. Against the foundationalist the constructivist hopes to show that the defence of objectivity need not appeal to any account of the necessary and unchanging foundations for moral reasoning. Evil has traditionally been seen in foundationalist terms, as a theological concept depending on the existence of God or as depending on some alternative scheme of absolute moral judgement, in order to mark out a special sort of wrongness. When these foundations have been challenged<br>

  Book Title: Muriel Rukeyser and Documentary-The Poetics of Connection<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gander Catherine<br>
  Abstract: This study of twentieth-century American poet Muriel Rukeyser explores the multiple avenues of her ‘poetics of connection’ to reveal a profound engagement with the equally intertextual documentary genre. It examines previously overlooked photo narratives, poetry, prose and archival material and demonstrates an enduring dialogue between the poet’s relational aesthetics and documentary’s similarly interdisciplinary and creative approach to the world. By considering the sources of documentary in Rukeyser’s work, the study provides insight into her guiding poetic principles, situating her as a vital figure in the history of twentieth-century American literature and culture, and as a pioneering personality in the development of American Studies.Key Features: Provides a new, interdisciplinary perspective on a critically neglected author, situating her firmly within the canon of essential twentieth century American poetsExamines previously overlooked material, including photo narratives, poetry, prose, and archival materialHighlights Rukeyser’s role in the formation of American StudiesOutlines the development of documentary in the 1930s, and its role in the formation of an American literary and cultural aesthetic<br>

  Abstract: The notion of textual allegory, as it derives from the
                  Social Contract,provides the generalizing principle which makes it possible to consider theotropical or ethical allegories as particularized versions of this generative model and thus to break down the significance of such thematic distinctions. It also implies that the terminology of generality, particularity, and generative power has a degree of referential undecidability which should exclude any simplified metaphorical use of these terms, while anticipating the failure to achieve such vigilance, or such immunity to rhetorical seduction. If, for example, we consider the introduction of a theological dimension into the political<br>

  Abstract: If the term ‘the Yale School’ continues to have currency it is less the result of a programme of published research by its members and more to do with the pedagogical programme established at Yale during de Man’s time there. In this sense de Man operated on the sound academic principle of attempting to transform an institution by running that institution: he served as Chair of the French Department at Yale from 1974 to 1977 and as Chair of the Comparative Literature Department from 1978 to his death in 1983. The legacy of Paul de Man is closely tied to<br>

  Abstract: This anthology¹ is conceived as background reading for courses in nineteenth and twentieth-century general literature, fiction, poetry or literary criticism, as taught in Departments of English, Comparative Literature or under the auspices of General Education (Humanities) programs. Since the principle of selection that has determined the choice of texts is not obvious, some clarification of the book’s general purpose may be needed.<br>

  CHAPTER 4  On Being in Good Taste from:

  Abstract: In the Massim way of sensing the world, the sense that is subject to the most restrictions is that of taste. In this chapter, we first examine how the repression (or constant deferral) of gustation is related to the centrality of exchange in Massim society, with the result that foods are classified and valued by reference to their presentability rather than their delectability. It also shows how Massim food preferences are ordered by a principle of likeness to humanity, as in the case of pork, which is reputed to be the next best thing to human flesh—at least in<br>

How should we go about criticizing law, if not by reference to general principles derived from reason? What does it mean, given the “death of reason,” to ask whether a particular law-say, a statute outlawing “surrogacy contracts,” or a judicial decision requiring the busing of schoolchildren to achieve integrated schools, or a law criminalizing sexual sodomy, or a constitutional provision or constitutional interpretation invalidating state statutes that criminalize abortions on demand-is a good law or<br>

  Author(s) Nicholson Michael<br>
  Abstract: Approaches to the analysis of international relations using formal methods are now well established. Models of international relations problems appear frequently in many of the leading journals. While there are still those who hold that formal methods only manage to render obscure what had hitherto been clear, the achievements of such methods, commonplace in all the other social sciences, make such positions hard to justify. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the principles behind formalization. I also wish to justify its extensive use, mainly by conceptual argument and by referring very briefly to some of the achievements. These<br>

As became clear from the seminar conversations that ensued, the concept of “archive” has a broader range of definitions than those of us who are practitioners in the field might have imagined. What also became clear was that the archivist’s role in the maintenance of this documentation was not at all clear.<br>

The system is structured and developed according to the principle of a unified leadership and administration at different levels. It consists of three types of archival institutions, each of them having clearly defined, state-mandated functions and responsibilities. These three types include archives administration departments (dangan ju), archives offices within agencies (dangan shi), and archives (dangan guan). The first type includes national and local (including provincial, municipal,<br>

  Book Title: Microdramas-Crucibles for Theater and Time<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Muse John H.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Microdramas, John H. Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater.Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamental and about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance.<br>

In particular, I focus on a number of interweaving creation narratives, primarily that of Adam and Eve, which form in the Abrahamic tradition the mythic center and site for discussions of intimate relationships between men and women. Within a variety of religious traditions, creation myths function as sacred stories of human origin, presenting religious communities with symbolic codes for understanding many dimensions of the human condition, including mappings<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Mary Faith<br>
  Abstract: Conceptions of risk raise issues of profound moral significance. Since the notion of risk always involves concern with possible harm (of whatever variety—not all harms are physical) or compromise of a person’s or group’s good, bioethicists tend to think about questions of risk as matters of beneficence. However, we will argue that beneficence does not exhaust the moral significance of risk—that conceptions of risk also raise issues of social justice. In itself, this is a noteworthy deviation from typical understandings of the application of the canonical principles of bioethics. Our analysis thus dovetails with that provided by Eva<br>

  Book Title: Visiones de Estereoscopio-Paradigma de hibridación en la ficción y el arte de la vanguardia española<br>
  Publisher: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Romance Studies<br>
  Author(s): UTRERA MARÌA SOLEDAD FERNÁNDEZ<br>
  Abstract: This book, written in Spanish, focuses on the literary and artistic works of such avant-garde figures as Ramon Gomez de la Serna, Benjamin Jarnes, Antonio de Obregon, Juan Chabas, Rosa Chacel, Claudio de la Torre, Almada Negreiros, Maruja Mallo, Mauricio Amster, Manuel Reinoso, Diego Rivera, and Angeles Santos y Victorio Macho. It identifies the attempt to integrate conflicting epistemological, ethical, and sociopolitical categories as the organizational principle driving the avant-garde novel and art. Seen as a means of escaping the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter, the conflict between ethical institutionism and utilitarianism, and the opposition of liberalism by socialism, this "middle path" manifests itself in the avant-garde on various levels: the theory of representation, the development of the protagonist, and the concept of history.<br>

Although she is described as a “pamphleteer,” the body of her work is sufficiently large, and her circle of acquaintances sufficiently vast, that she, like Anne Conway, is best thought of as a philosopher—although, in Astell’s case, as one with a decidedly political bent.¹<br>

  Abstract: Ethical formalism has been the dominant paradigm in communication ethics. Formalist ethical systems are based on rules, principles, and doctrines that set standards for human behavior. Through reason the human species is distinctive, and through rationality moral canons are understood to be legitimate. Ethics is typically grounded in prescriptions, norms, and ideals external to society and culture. In mainstream professional ethics, an apparatus of neutral standards is constructed in terms of the major issues media practitioners face in their everyday routines.<br>

As is frequently remarked in African literary studies, there is often a cross-mapping of literature onto national politics.

Scholars such as Neil Lazarus (1990) and Ato Sekyi-Otu (1996), with a more theoretical motivation and drawing on Fanon, have tried to provide a framework by which these connections could be addressed more rigorously.

  Abstract: This ambitious work explores the vexed connections among nation building, ethnic identity, and regional conflict by focusing on a specific event: Indian political and military intervention in the ethnic conflict between the Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka. Postcolonial Insecurities counters the perception of “ethnicity” as an inferior and subversive principle compared with the progressive ideal of the “nation.” Krishna, in fact, shows ethnicity to be indispensable to the production and reproduction of the nation itself.<br>

  Abstract: Although the founding principles of nonresistance were acclaimed with a “sacred respect for the right of opinion,” there was little doubt that the discussion of nonresistance in public venues and print media honored William Lloyd Garrison’s right of opinion. It was his exercise of this right that gave nonresistance a regular column and columnist in
                  The Liberator,the flagship abolitionist newspaper; it was his editorial policy that in turn set the agenda for the abolition movement and, his critics charged, turned it away from the singular object of freeing the slaves.

It was Douglass who appeared as the representative of abolition principles through and in bodily form; it was Douglass’s body that audiences acclaimed when they embraced abolitionist rhetoric.

If that citizen was Henry Adams, his patriotism would be indistinguishable from his filiopiety, which he admitted was alive and well in the 1840s.

  Abstract: Henry David Thoreau’s participation in the abolition movement was governed by the same principles that underwrote the New England abolitionists’ public sphere, and that is why it should be considered to be marginal. With his “experiment in living,” Thoreau expressed in dramatic and conclusive form the abolitionists’ determination to separate their movement from the civil institutions of the political public sphere and from any positive representation of a people. His commitment to his own exclusion from the sphere of normative social relations led him to articulate a highly resonant discourse of social norms, which, like the abolitionists’ discourse of publicity,<br>

The week after John Brown raided Harpers Ferry in October 1859, Thoreau personally organized three public events so he could defend Brown and his raid. Public opinion in the North already cast Brown as a “monomaniac” and murderer, but Thoreau linked him to Puritans and Revolutionary fathers who, unlike enfranchised northern whites, would not sacrifice the principle of equality to expedience. Because the Dred Scott case effectively nationalized slavery, Thoreau argued, Brown’s self-sacrificing violence was needed not only to free<br>

  Abstract: Lévi-Strauss invites us to criticize the notion of the rights of man, which he affirms are too strongly anchored in a philosophy of subjectivity. He says we should replace it with the principle of a system of the rights of man as a living being, a right of the human species among other species: this is “wild” and pessimist thinking. Its austere analysis makes it irredeemable for the movements of “deep ecology.”¹ It would certainly be a misunderstanding and a caricature of this position from an ethnographer to use it to claim, for example, an extension of the rights of<br>

  Abstract: In

In this way, Benhabib associates the Utopian impulse with what Ernst Bloch calls our “principle of hope”—our ability and desire to imagine something other and better than our existing conditions. At the same time, however, the Utopian impulse is characterized by a set of conservative logics and gestures that are increasingly seen as<br>

I have discussed the connection between the traditional utopian form in literature (with its emphasis on harmony and purity, its projection of contamination; and its suppression of agency) and a conception of the subject based on principles of unity and self-consistency. I have discussed the consequences when feminist utopias accept the traditional utopian form’s grounding in a homology between the integrated individual body and the harmonious social space, and the possibilities that present themselves when writers<br>

  Abstract: During the twentieth century, the view that assertions and norms are valid insofar as they respond to principles independent of all local and temporal contexts came under attack from two perspectives: the partiality of translation and the intersubjective constitution of the self, understood as responsive to recognition. Defenses of universalism have by and large taken the form of a thinning out of substantive universalism into various forms of proceduralism.<br>

  Abstract: Political traditions and philosophical conceptions differ on the extent to which they allow the force of the example, and judgment, to play a role within their framework. Only the most extreme embed the ambition to filter out any and all possible role that judgment and exemplarity might play—game theoretical approaches to political choice are of this kind, for instance—but by and large all conceptions of normativity do attribute to judgment a role at least in discerning the correct and appropriate application of independently established principles of a more general nature.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Hegel's "highway of despair," introduced in his

Despair, the passionate residue of Hegelian critique, also indicates fugitive opportunities for freedom and preserves the principle of hope against all hope. Analyzing the works of an eclectic cast of thinkers, Robyn Marasco considers the dynamism of despair as a critical passion, reckoning with the forms of historical life forged along Hegel's highway.<br>

  Book Title: Political Responsibility-Responding to Predicaments of Power<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): VÁZQUEZ-ARROYO ANTONIO Y.<br>
  Abstract: Sounding the alarm for those who care about robust forms of civic engagement, this book fights for a new conception of political responsibility that meets the challenges of today's democratic practice. Antonio Y. Vázquez-Arroyo forcefully argues against the notion that modern predicaments of power can only be addressed ethically or philosophically through pristine concepts that operate outside of the political realm. By returning to the political, the individual is reintroduced to the binding principles of participatory democracy and the burdens of acting and thinking as a member of a collective. Vázquez-Arroyo historicizes the ethical turn to better understand its ascendence and reworks Adorno's dialectic of responsibility to reassert the political in contemporary thought and theory.<br>

  Author(s) Zacchetti Stefano<br>
  Abstract: All the various bodies of scriptures evoked by the name “Buddhist canon”—such as the Pali canon, the Tibetan canon, the Mongolian canon, and the Chinese canon, just to mention those surviving in a more or less complete form—are in fact very different things from the viewpoint of their internal structure and formative principles. They were shaped by different historical forces, in response to different cultural and political conditions. All these differences are partly masked by the use of unifying terms such as “canon,” “Tripitaka,” etc., to refer to these collections. If taken uncritically, all these designations are potentially<br>

  Author(s) Storch Tanya<br>
  Abstract: It can be argued that the proper history of the Chinese Buddhist canon begins with its printed editions because the printed format allows for easier access, wider dissemination, standardization of the contents, and preservation of textual stability. But before the earliest printed editions appeared, for a period of more than five hundred years, Chinese scholars zealously labored over the creation of the principles of textual criticism and taxonomic organization, which they applied to the handwritten canon and which eventually affected the contents and structure of the printed version. In the canon catalogs, various manuscripts of translated Buddhist texts, as well<br>

  Book Title: Chinese History and Culture-Seventeenth Century Through Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Duke Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  Abstract: Patricia McAnany has observed that creating a “genealogy of place” has been of historic concern to Maya communities. The establishment and recognition of land rights, in both colonial- and modern-era Yucatán, seems to have involved questions of inheritance, habitual encroachment, or primary occupancy. McAnany has suggested that similar ideas existed in pre-Hispanic times, with the “principle of first occupancy” defining lineage customs and conflicts in the Classic Maya lowlands. In essence, the first individuals to colonize a given area gain permanent ownership of the best agricultural lands; families who arrive later are forced to either fight for decent arable land<br>

  Abstract: Understanding what heritage means to community groups is an essential prerequisite for active, creative and successful engagement with them. Heritage is a cultural construct comprising different ideological and material phenomena for diverse groups of people, which means there are innumerable possible heritages, each shaped for the specific user group. However, although there may be an infinite variety of possible heritages, in New Zealand, for example, the dominant Western discourse controls the development of independent heritages. This chapter provides evidence of two different ‘heritages’ and identifies key principles about heritage. A view of heritage has emerged since 2011 that reflects the<br>

  Abstract: The title “father of modern philosophy” (

By introducing mathematical methods into philosophy, Descartes founded the rationalist tradition in epistemology (the theory of knowledge and its objects), which holds that all knowledge of reality is ultimately derived from the exercise of human reason according to foundational principles independent of the senses. The rationalist position, which in Germany was taken up by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), Christian Wolff (1679–1754), and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–62), gave philosophical underpinnings to the European intellectual movement<br>

Issue: ajs.2000.106.issue-2<br>
Date: 09 2000<br>
Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”

            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A. Hollinger, "Historians and the Discourse of Intellectuals," 42-63; and Thomas Bender, "The Cultures of Intellectual Life: The City and the Professions," 181-95. 6 For consensus history as synthesis, see especially Daniel J. Boorstin, The Americans, 3 vols.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions. One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 8 For an insightful and quite worrisome examination of recent scholarly practice and its trajectory, see Winfried Fluck, "The Modernity of America and the Practice of Scholarship," in Thomas Bender, ed., Rethinking American History in a Global Age (Berkeley, Calif., 2002). 9 See, for example, Gertrude Himmelfarb, The New History and the Old (Cambridge, Mass., 1987). This volume includes essays published by Himmelfarb between 1975 and 1984. 10 Herbert G.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995).

Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic.

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history.

Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996).

If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

They are indispensable readings for students of political philosophy in their examination of transcendence, philosophy, and politics. By seeing Voegelin as a postmodern thinker and by showing his exchange with Strauss, both of these books provide us with a broader context to understand Voegelin's political philosophy. As part of the University of Missouri Press' new series, bothFaith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsprovide intellectually provocative and serious-minded secondary works on Eric Voegelin and his ultimate place in political philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to uncover the mytho-symbolic parallels between the social-psychological theories of noted sociologist W. I. Thomas and the vision of moral-religious transformation recorded in John Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress." Thomas' emphasis on the "definition of the situation," precise stages of moral development, and the four wishes are seen to be derived from Bunyan's themes of spiritual instruction along Christian's journey, his progress through various stages of sanctification, and the various spiritual polarities established by Bunyan as structuring principles of his text. Thomas is understood to have distorted Bunyan's vision of ultimate transcendence by equating salvation with adoption of the Protestant ethic and its institutional context of the American political and economic status quo.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconstruction of the text is the condition for the possibility of its being a story that "gives life." This notion of "reader" makes possible a new model of the hermeneutical circle-one which signifies the essential roles of critical thought which follows naive reading and of informed understanding which follows after thought.<br>

Author(s): Underhill David R.<br>
Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important positive functions of its own) begets as an unfortunate byproduct this tendency to spin out a causal account of the first evil, with the conceptual confusion resulting from it.<br>

Abstract: The legend is, as custum, the place were the principle of reality is suspended: "the place were day-dreaming is allowed". Actually, in the current practice, the use of this fabulous space/instrument crosses ambits officially destinated to the reverie. Fragments of legend impregnate the entire experience allowing us the most shameless alchemy. If we consider the "legendary" in its pragmatic implications and pass through the question: "what do we do, in the every day life, when we evoke in a more or less explicit way the semantic constellation linked with the notion of legend?", then the "legendary" is not so much the "projective place" where we live for a moment our phantasies, but rather an operation that allows to reconcile concrete interests and ideal values, playing on the demarcation line and mixing up cards skilfully.<br>

Abstract: Using the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, and against the background of the principle that the real is what is or can be given in a public way in perception as a state of the World, and of the thesis established elsewhere that acts of perception are always epistemic, contextual, and hermeneutical, the writer proposes that objects of scientific observation are perceptual objects, states of the World described by theoretical scientific terms and, therefore, real. This thesis of Hermeneutical Realism is proved by showing how the response of a standard instrument is 'read' as if it were a 'text'. Conclusions are then drawn about a number of topics, including Scientific Realism, Conventionalism, and Cultural Relativism.<br>

Abstract: It has recently been claimed (1) that mental states such as beliefs are theoretical entities and (2) that they are therefore, in principle, subject to theoretical elimination if intentional psychology were to be supplanted by a psychology not employing mentalistic notions. Debate over these two issues is seriously hampered by the fact that the key terms 'theoretical' and 'belief' are ambiguous. This article argues that there is only one sense of 'theoretical' that is of use to the eliminativist, and in this sense some kinds of "belief" (dispositional states, infra-conscious states and the Freudian unconscious) are indeed "theoretical" and hence possible candidates for elimination, while others (consciously occurring thoughts like judgements and perceptual Gestalten) are not theoretical and hence not candidates for elimination.<br>

Abstract: Euro-American theories of psychotherapeutic intervention focus on therapist behavior or the therapeutic relationship, conceived in dyadic terms. The cultural prototype is individualistic and rationalistic: a one-to-one conversation in which the patient discloses and discusses innermost feelings in regular office visits. This may be appropriate for modern Euro-Americans. However, anthropological research finds that in many traditional healing systems, intervention is communal, it utilizes dramatic ritual ordeals and altered states of consciousness rather than rational conversations, and the healer-patient relationship may be less central. This article argues that the latter approach is not ignorant of psychotherapeutic principles; it has its own (however opposed to Euro-American assumptions they may be). Understanding this paradigm clash broadens our understanding of what psychotherapeutic intervention is. It also allows clinicians and policy makers to support traditional peoples in their own efforts at self-healing. Examples will be drawn from the author's work on the healing ceremonies of the Native American Church among contemporary Navajos.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the moral subject of cooperative relations proceeds from a different point of departure than a formalistic ethics based on individualism and rationalism. Shweder (Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 1982, 28, 41–69) fails to see that, in this theory, persons communicate in order to co-construct knowledge and to maintain and promote mutual respect. Moral principles are, thus, cooperatively generated because validity is grounded in the structure of reciprocal relations.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mankind: The discovery of the unreality of man's existence apart from God, is the discovery at the same time of the fact that God is the ultimate ground of the unity of mankind. According to Jaspers the fact of life are to conform to the principle of that wider order of reality disclosed to us in the experience of communication in which the reality of each person's likeness to the image of God finds its practical application. The development of communication depends on the principle of correlation of Existenz and Transcendenz which is the property of no finite existential self, but manifests itself alike in all. Though we may be confronted with the question "Is it God or the devil who governs the world?", it remains equally true that even "failure is no argument against the truth that is rooted in transcendence". 3) Ultimate Dignity of Man: Jaspers' unequivocal emphasis on freedom, stating that "Freedom and God are inseparable" serves to assure this ideal its place in human society. Thus man's exercise of freedom knits him up into the transcendental design. The claim that certain facts and experiences yield a basis for the recognition of the ultimate dignity of man is justified precisely by this evidence that through God, as inseparable from freedom, we discern the ultimate significance of both man and humanity.<br>

Abstract: Augustine applies rhetorical principles of On Christian Doctrine to Book Eight of the Confessions by synthesizing four conversion stories as reenactments of the gospel paradigm. This pattern invites readers to repeat that reenactment. Thus Augustine's rhetorical design rather than a self-analysis or compulsion to confess informs the Confessions as autobiography.<br>

Abstract: The exegetical stories of Genesis Rabbah 8 portray God as engaged in an ethical debate over the implications of humanity's creation. These stories narrativize the necessity of favoring mercy over justice. The Deity must mobilize the attribute of mercy to overcome the justice problem of human fallibility. These stories rehearse the conflict of values in an "organic" fashion as opposed to discursive argumentation over abstract principles, and suggest a virtue theory grounded in mercy and kindness without being inflexible or absolutist. As such, mercy and kindness should be inculcated not over and above Jewish law but prior to the law.<br>

Abstract: The Anglo-American discipline of International Relations defends its main principles and resists with an almost religious fervor any change to them, although the explanation of world affairs has been eluding it since its inception. The article attempts to draw up possibly the first historiography of the IR scholarship about religion in world affairs since the 90s, showing the heightened interest in the subject from most other social sciences and humanities. The article proposes the use of the term 'International Political Theology' to bridge the multiple literatures as well as to underscore the theological commitment of the IR discipline to its basic creeds and dogmas.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: This paper, a reply to Professor R. S. Downie's criticisms of our paper 'A Political Critique of Kantian Ethics in Social Work', both appearing in BJSW 19, 6, tries to answer the main charge against us of illegitimately bridging the logical gap between statements of value and statements of fact. In addition to this, we explicate further our original arguments that language and power are indissolubly bound to each other, and that a Kantian approach to social work theory and practice fails in trying to dissolve that relationship by finding a neutral, universal ground from which to derive ethical principles and judgements.<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: Classroom discipline systems are considered as patriarchal moral systems focused on hyper-individuality and dependent upon rules, consequences, and principles focused through authoritarian structures. Three example systems (Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, and Discipline with Dignity) are critiqued using Noddings' analysis of evil and Welch's liberation theology. As an alternative grounding, freedom of responsibility is proposed, moved foward through Noddings' mediation and care and Welch's dangerous memory and solidarity with oppressed peoples. Les différentes approches à la discipline dans la salle de classe sont considérés comme des systèmes patriarcaux et moraux qui ont pour but de brimer l'individualité. Ces systèmes ont également comme bases des règlements, des conséquences et des principes imposés par des structures autoritaires. A la lumière de l'analyse de Nodding sur le mal et de la théologie de la libération de Welch, nous critiquons trois systèmes de discipline: "Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, Discipline with Dignity." Comme alternative nous proposons plutôt une approche dite "liberté responsable" qui s'inspire des concepts de médiation et de soin de Nodding et des concepts de mémoire dangereuse et de solidarité des opprimés de Welch.<br>

Abstract: This article attempts to pose the principles for the use of certain tools, forged in linguistics, for sociological analysis, particularly for the analysis of interviews. Far from being a simple collection of information, the interviews with migrants analyzed here are an arena for intense language activity. With the use of concepts such as annunciation, pragmatism and natural logic, various language functions are identified that sociologists should take into consideration: the construction of representations, negotiation of one's position in an interaction. Contrary to the spontaneous sociology of certain linguistics, language practices are not those of an actor free of all social determinants. On the contrary, by taking into consideration the complexity of language, sociology can construct a plural, heterogeneous and even divided actor. Cet article essaie de poser les principes d'utilisation de quelques outils forgés en linguistique pour l'analyse sociologique, plus particulièrement pour l'analyse des entretiens. Loin d'être une simple collection d'informations, les entretiens analysés ici, qui sont des entretiens de migrants, sont le lieu d'une intense activité langagière. En recourant aux concepts de l'énonciation, de la pragmatique et de la logique naturelle, sont repérés divers fonctionnements langagiers que le sociologue a tout intérêt à considérer: construction des représentations, négociation des places dans l'interaction. Cependant, contrairement à la sociologie spontanée de certaines linguistiques, les pratiques langagières ne sont pas celles d'un acteur libre de toutes déterminations. Au contraire, en prenant en compte toute la complexité du langage, le sociologue peut construire un acteur pluriel, hétérogène, voire divisé.<br>

Abstract: Michael Frayn's play, Copenhagen, dramatises as a ghost story the conversation concerning the moral implications of atomic fission among Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and his wife, Margrethe Bohr, in September 1941. This paper argues that the play generalises from the famous uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics to present the necessary appearance of uncertainty at the historical, moral, and theological levels of reflection. The paper traces the meaning of uncertainty back to the 'being of the self' as a cipher for divine transcendence, and it interprets the meaning of uncertainty for the theory and method of theological humanism.<br>

Abstract: This essay outlines and illustrates ways that 'theological humanism' provides methodological possibilities for scholars working in religion and literary studies. I suggest there is a need to investigate more humanistic methods of interpreting literature by exploring approaches that engage questions of sacred depth. After stressing the necessary paradoxes of theological humanism as an interpretive and lived stance in the world, I offer a reading of Margaret Edson's Wit that is shaped by these principles.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: This article critically assesses Bell's attempt at transforming discourse analysis into discourse interpretation by means of hermeneutics as developed by Paul Ricoeur. If a hermeneutic turn is to take place in a discipline that proceeds according to the principles of empirical research, cognitive hermeneutics is the better option compared to Ricoeur's hermeneutics. Part I presents a short introduction to cognitive hermeneutics as developed by Tepe. Against this background, some central theses of Ricoeur's hermeneutics, on which Bell's approach is based, are discussed in part II.<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Der Begriff der Dialektik, der zur Beschreibung einer derartigen Verbindung zwischen
Ursprung und Ziel gern reserviert wird, wäre hier unangemessen, weil er die Differenz unter-
schlägt, die Trieb und Mythos wie Unsichtbares und Sichtbares trennt. Freuds Deutung bringt
den Mythos im Trieb zum Verschwinden, aber umgekehrt den Trieb im Teufel zur Präsenz. Die
kulturtheoretischen Erzählungen der Psychoanalyse verschaffen dieser Präsenz eine Bühne, die
nicht nur der Vorführung des Teufels, sondern auch der Demonstration der eigenen erkenntnis-
kritischen Leistung dient; vgl. dazu H. Böhme: Fetischismus und Kultur, a.a.O. [Anm. 9] 408ff.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the conduct and evaluation of interpretive research in information systems. While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies. A set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field research in information systems is proposed, along with their philosophical rationale. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by evaluating three published interpretive field studies drawn from the IS research literature. The intention of the paper is to further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding interpretive research methodology.<br>

Abstract: Societies, like individuals, strive to have positive self-concepts. They endow stories of their origin and associate their course through history with ethical principles that attest to who they are and how they want to be seen. Such principles define the society for its members and for the world at large. But all societies must at some time confront evidence of actions undertaken in their name that violate their fundamental principles and conflict with their desired self-image. Following a glance at the basic elements of the politics of history and identity, the author suggests two sources of the tensions between "bad acts" and positive self-concepts. Both relate to shifts in developmental time. First, actions not considered wrong when they were undertaken in the past are inconsistent with current expectation. Second, transsocietal differences in normative frameworks lead to cross-boundary criticisms of behavior in which the critics' societies likely engaged at an earlier time. Accusations or criticisms generally meet with defensive, often hostile responses. Hypocrisy tends to rule in most cases, with little or no normative learning.<br>

Abstract: The article investigates in the first part critically dyadic and essentialist understanding of signs and utterances in mathematics and mathematics education as opposed to a triadic view. However even Peircean semiotics, giving priority to triadic, dynamic sign may face challenges, such as explaining the sign as a pragmatic act and how signs are related to context. To meet these and other hurdles an explicit communicational, pragmatic and triadic view, found in parts of the works of Bühler, Bakhtin, Habermas, and Halliday, is developed. Two basic principles are combined and established in a theoretical framework. Firstly, whenever uttering, there will exist in any semiotic sign system, dynamic reciprocity and simultaneity between expressing through form, referring to content, and addressing as an act. Secondly, meaning will be created by the dynamics between given and new in utterances and between utterances and contextual genres. The latter principle explains how meaning merge in communication dynamically and create the basis for a discursive understanding of semiosis and hence even learning at large. The second part exemplifies each of the three main aspects and the dynamics of utterance and genre and given and new by excerpts from a textbook in mathematics education. The concept 'positioning', in use for operationalisation, is explained in relation to main principles of the framework. The article ends focusing crucial implications for validation when moving from a dyadic to a triadic understanding of mathematics and mathematics education.<br>

Abstract: A partir d'une étude menée en avril 2003 auprès de trois ONG guatémaltèques impliquées dans le processus de paix, cet article cherche à interroger les registres dominants en ce qui concerne les modalités de réconciliation de pays ayant connu la guerre. En étudiant les registres locaux de la reconstruction du "vivre-ensemble", l'économie morale et politique dans laquelle ils s'inscrivent, et les champs du discours auxquels ils renvoient, je veux montrer les limites que pose un contexte encore répressif aux approches et pratiques actuellement en vogue dans le domaine de la paix et de la réconciliation. /// Based on a study conducted within three NGOs involved in the Guatemalan peace process, this article interrogates dominant discourses and practices upon which strategies of reconciliation in postwar countries are based. Examining local idioms of the reconstruction of the principle of "living together," and in particular the moral and political economy in which these idioms are embedded and the discursive fields to which they refer, enables us to identify the obstacles that a repressive political context may impose on processes of peace-building and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Medicine bottles, examined within a larger context, provide an opportunity to explore how material culture influences, reinforces, and reflects late 19th-century gender roles. Bottles from one of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park's late 19th-century privies reflect the gender role of a mother. Available information limits this paper to the examination of a 19th-century ideal. Examining the ideal through both archaeological and documentary evidence, however, reveals the apparatus of ideology and the effects of the ideal in practice. A mutual relationship between genders becomes apparent as does the need to maintain the interrelatedness of gender with other structuring principles of culture.<br>

Abstract: The attentions given to textual production in composition scholarship have led to a neglect of the dynamics of textual reception. Renewed acquaintance with the discipline of hermeneutics will provide scholars and instructors with a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between interpretive processes and rhetorical strategies. Building on the work of Phelps, Mailloux, and Crusius, this article revisits Gadamer and Ricoeur, two of the more prominent scholars of modern hermeneutics, for the purpose of applying their principles to learning objectives and class assignments in college-level writing courses.<br>

These refugee city dwellers, committed to the fundamental principles of national resistance, the struggle for the right to return and membership in the Palestinian community, are nevertheless driven by relationships expressing their roots and attachment s that place a value on proximity and private property.<br>

Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.<br>

Abstract: The task of anthropology consists in describing and explaining cultures and ultimately reaching an understanding of them through interpretation. The practical difficulties of this are obvious to all those who have dealth with members of another culture. As Malinowski observed, the anthropologist's task is to be "the interpreter of the native." It is suggested that some of the principles elucidated in the philosophical discipline of hermeneutics, such as understanding in context as opposed to preunderstanding and the dialectical relationship between the interpreter and the object of interpretation, may be helpful in defining the essential problems that anthropologists may encounter in their attempts to interpret cultures.<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Abstract: Medical ethics, principles, persons, and perspectives is discussed under three headings: "History", "Theory", and "Practice". Under "Theory", the author will say something about some different approaches to the study and discussion of ethical issues in medicine–especially those based on principles, persons, or perspectives. Under "Practice", the author will discuss how one perspectives based approach, hermeneutics, might help in relation first to everyday ethical issues and then to public controversies. In that context some possible advantages of moving from controversy to conversation will be explored; and that will then be illustrated with reference to a current controversy about the use of human embryos in stem cell therapy research. The paper begins with history, and it begins in the author's home city of Edinburgh.<br>

Author(s): Bird Frederick<br>
Abstract: Typically people make ethical judgments with reference to unchanging principles, standards, rights, and values. This essay argues that such an ahistorical approach to ethics should be supplemented by a due regard for history. Invoking precedents by authors such as Jonsen and Toulmin, McIntyre, Niebuhr, Weber, De Tocqueville, Machiavelli and others, this essay explores several important ways in which a due regard for history can and should shape the practice of business ethics. Thus a due regard for history helps us both to cultivate fitting appreciation of cultural mores and to understand how current problems and issues have developed as they have; it helps us to gauge current responsibilities with respect legacies of problems inherited from the past; it helps us to develop a lively sense of what is possible in the present, given current contingencies and past experiences; and it moves us to rethink the practice of ethical auditing: not just as a backward-looking effort to gauge compliance but as a forward-looking way of learning from actual experiences and developing fitting responses.<br>

Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the "transactional zone." The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)<br>

Abstract: One way into the question of the relation of ethics and liturgy is to focus on a critical issue facing liturgy today: its impoverishment and inability to nurture Christian faith and life. Three aspects of this problem are: injustice within the worshipping community, disagreement regarding forms of Christian service to the world, and the breakdown of symbols. Ethics must move beyond the articulation of formal principles and assertions regarding the importance of liturgy for the moral agent if it is to fulfill its task vis-à-vis these problems.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's libertarian ideals into a political agenda; secondly, an attempt to change to solid state with the 1989's Orientation Act (act laying down the basic principles for government action in education) and the creation of the "Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective" (assessment & futurology office); finally, the destabilisation of this system by Claude Allègre, the then French education secretary who put the French educational system into the picture of international competition. A period of doubts "under influence" followed right after. Es handelt sich darum, mehrere in den letzten 30 Jahren vorgefundenen Verwandlungen aufzuklären: zunächst die Gründung eines Expertenmilieus zwischen Politik, Verwaltung und Forschung. Dann einen Wandel des Rahmens, in dem die Überlegung stattfindet: es geht nämlich weniger darum, über den Zusammenhalt einer Gesellschaft in einem internationalen Rahmen nachzudenken als über die Art und Weise zu überlegen, wie das Land seinen Platz im internationalen Wettbewerb behalten kann. Schließlich einen Wandel der politischen Orientierung: die Bemühung um die Bildung einer Elite wird wieder vorrangig, auch wenn es nicht mehr darauf ankommt, eine kulturelle Tradition zu behalten, sondern seinen Marktanteil zu retten. Der Text bearbeitet diese Entwicklungen in Frankreich und unterscheidet dabei drei Perioden: erstens eine Zeit der „gasförmigen” Politik, in der die Linksparteien versuchen, die anarchistischen 1968er Ideale in ein Regierungsprogramm umzusetzen; zweitens ein Versuch der Verfestigung mit dem Orientierungsgesetz 1989 und die Gründung des Bewertungs- und Forschungsamtes (Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective); drittens eine Destabilisierung dieses Systems durch den Erziehungsminister Claude Allègre, der das französische Schulsystem mit der internationalen Konkurrenz konfrontiert. Darauf folgt eine „unter Einfluß" stehende und zugleich unsichere Periode. Se trata de aclarar varios desplazamientos que se produjeron en los treinta últimos años. Primero, la creación de un medio de expertos intermediarios entre la política, la administración y investigación. Después, un cambio del marco dentro del que se sitúa la reflexión. No se trata tanto de pensar la cohesión de una sociedad en un marco nacional como de la manera en que el país puede mantener su rango en la competencia internacional. Por fin, un cambio de orientación política : la preocupación por la formación de lo más selecto vuelve a ser primordial aunque ya no se trata de mantener una tradición cultural sino de proteger sus cuotas de mercado. El texto estudia estas evoluciones en Francia distinguiendo tres períodos : un período de « política en estado gaseoso » en el que la izquierda intenta transformar los ideales libertarios de 1968 en programa de gobierno ; un intento de pasar al estado sólido con la ley de orientación de 1989 y la creación la Dirección de la evaluación y de la prospectiva ; una destabilización de este sistema por el ministro Claude Allègre que echa el sistema educativo francés en el gran baño de la competencia internacional. De ahí resulta un período a la vez «bajo influencia » y de incertidumbre.<br>

Abstract: In thought as well as in imagery, two of Auden's poems, "Death's Echo" and "Danse Macabre," appear to draw on such diverse manifestations of the medieval cult of death as lyric poems of memento mon, dialogues between the "quick and the dead," and the macabre tradition in morality plays. Combining the concept of the verbal icon (Wimsatt) with the principles of the theory of metaphor, as summarized by Ricoeur in The Rule of Metaphor (1977), the paper studies a selection of medieval poems and those of Auden as complex macro-vehicles and contrasts the possible tenors they are carrying.<br>

Abstract: This article addresses the woman teller's identity in the literary fairy tales of France. The author rereads prefaces and images that scholars have used to demonstrate the woman teller's literarity to argue rather for her "frivolity," a word the women themselves use to describe their writing. The essay finds that frivolity is an aesthetic principle at the heart of the women's poetic project that marks their difference from even the Modern partisans of the great literary debate. The principle of frivolity is captured in an image that recurs in prefaces by the writers: the "modern" fairy.<br>

Abstract: In 1884 an Ottoman public prosecutor and fellow officials stood trial for abusing their official authorities when attending to an incident in one of Istanbul's neighborhoods. A published verbatim report of the proceedings is used in this article for discussing Ottoman socio-legal change in the late nineteenth century, employing a microhistorical perspective. Following a major reform in the new court system, which was established in the 1860s (the Nizamiye courts), the judicial authorities used the trial in question for transmitting the commitment of the modernizing state to the rule of law, exhibited by the principle of officials' accountability. Features of the reformed judicial system and its distinctive legal culture are demonstrated in this article by unfolding the judicial aspects of this episode and by discussing connections between them and the immediate socio-political and socio-legal contexts of the trial.<br>

Abstract: The principle of hermeneutical interpretation (i.e., the art and discipline of analyzing the symbols of sacred texts) is explained and applied to the analytical group situation. It is maintained that the approach employed by this methodology provides a viable manner for understanding patients' unconscious communications. In particular, the relationship between metaphorical communication and the here-and-now therapeutic experience is discussed. It is argued that the unconscious manifests itself as a set o f metaphorical expressions. The paper presents two clinical vignettes illustrating how this hermeneutical methodology can aid the therapist to "read" the unconscious meanings of such metaphors.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents a history of the large group approach in relation to Foulkesian group analytic psychotherapy, including the nature of this approach in relation to Foulkesian principles. Much of the theory reflects Foulkes's attitude, but there are also clear distinctions made, notably a new stance in our thinking about groups as a result of the increase in size (i.e., a membership of about 20), the introduction of the cultural dimension which this increase entails, and the question of what happens after the resolution of Kleinian, oedipal and familial conflicts has been achieved in psychoanalysis and small groups, notably what happens once "exile" has been achieved. The approach presented proposes to handle the frustration and hate that these conflicts engender in the form of negative or antilibidinal energies, and their transformation into psychic energy, through dialogue leading from hate to the establishment of koinonia, or impersonal fellowship, and of microcultural influences which promote rather than inhibit communication. Being neither small nor large, a group of about 20 members has become known as a "median" group.<br>

Abstract: A broad conceptual framework is presented for utilizing spirituality in group psychotherapy. The author considers (a) selected concepts and theory relevant to the spiritual aspect of psychotherapy practice; (b) the change in assumptions about the person and the group they imply; (c) the mystical aspects of the listening/observing process; and (d) aspects of the new sciences compatible with spiritual principles. Using a psychospiritual paradigm, the author offers a view of group therapy that emphasizes the therapist as a contemporary mystic, the group as a sacred space, and a return to profound, timeless, nonrelativist spiritual values and goals, nonsensory infinite dimensional experience leading to deep transformation of the self, and the compatibility of contemporary scientific frameworks with spiritual principles that can form the basis of new theorizing and group interpretations.<br>

Abstract: For the last six years, China's historic yaodong cave dwellings, still home to millions of people, have been a focus of work by the Green Architecture Research Center (GARC) of Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology. To date, the GARC, working intimately with the local people of Zao Yuan Village outside of Yan'an in Shaanxi Province, has designed and constructed more than one hundred new yaodong units using the principles of "green architecture." This report suggests that these efforts represent an exemplary application of Kenneth Frampton's notion of "critical regionalism." Specifically, in contrast to the rampant and largely unreflective importation of Western architectural styles common to new construction in many of China's urban centers, the new yaodong units result from a sensitive effort to merge the old with the new and maintain vernacular values.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le Sakuteiki (Notes sur l'arrangement des jardins, XIe siècle) jusqu'aux jardins de daïmyôs de l'époque d'Edo (1603-1867), le jardin japonais est empreint d'une tendance marquée à référer les formes de ses constituants à des sites et à des paysages modèles dénommés « sites de renom » (meisho). Ce système de référence est appelé mitate, ce qui signifie littéralement « instituer par le regard ». Cela se rapporte, d'une part, au principe de la métaphore, et, d'autre part, au dynamisme fondamental des localisations dans l'écoumène, tel que l'illustrent le couple topos/chôra dans le Timée et la distinction que fait Nishida entre logique d'identité du sujet et logique d'identité du prédicat. Fron the Sakuteiki (Notes on the making of gardens, XIth c.) to daimyos gardens of the Edo period (1603-1867), the Japanese gardens display a prominent tendency to refer its material forms to paradigmatic places and landscapes, called « places with a name » (meisho). This system of reference was called mitate, which literaly means « instituting by seeing ». It is here related, on the one hand, to the principle of metaphor, and on the other hand to the fundamental dynamics of place in the ecumene, as illustrated by the couple topos/chôra in the Timaios and by Nishida's dictinstion between a logic of the identity of the subject and a logic of the identity of the predicate (or logic of place).<br>

Abstract: S'il déclame contre les deux principes qui sont ceux de Descartes, Sartre se réclame pourtant de lui. Sans doute n'est-il pas à un paradoxe près. Reste qu'il nous faudra ne pas l'être moins pour expliquer le sien. Car certes, le sens du texte qu'il intitule « La liberté cartésienne » et qui articule ce volume de morceaux choisis qu'est Descartes 1596-1650 confère quelque cohérence à cet apparent non-sens. Mais une fois présenté de cette oeuvre le paratexte, il nous faudra affirmer non seulement que celle-ci se lit avant L'être et le néant quoiqu'elle ait été publiée après, mais, plus encore, qu'elle est un ensemble d'écrits de Descartes sur Sartre quoiqu'elle soit un écrit de Sartre sur Descartes. C'est qu'outre l'analyse sartrienne des analyses cartésiennes de la Méditation quatrième, on y trouve une psychanalyse existentielle par l'auteur de son devancier, à l'occasion de laquelle a lieu non pas un transfert, mais un contre-transfert. Although Sartre denounces Descartes' two principles, he nevertheless draws inspiration from him. No doubt this is close to being paradoxical; we shall have to be no less paradoxical in our explanation. For although the text entitled "Cartesian Freedom," which introduces a volume of selections from Descartes, Descartes 1596Ί650, confers some coherence on this apparent non-sense, once the texts surrounding this work have been taken into account, we have to conclude not only that this text predates Beinjj and Nothingness, even though it was published afterwards, but that it is a collection of Descartes' writings on Sartre, even though it is a writing by Sartre on Descartes. For beyond the Sartrean analysis of the Cartesian analyses of the Fourth Meditation, we find Sartre's existential psychoanalysis of his predecessor, in which takes place not a transference, but a counter-transference.<br>

Abstract: Despite recent critical denigrations of the representation of temporality as a defining interest in narrative, it is important to reappraise the epiphany as a feature of the short stories of "founding" modernist women writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Nevertheless, the association of the epiphanic story with "feminine" writing drove a writer like Doris Lessing to reject the epiphany as an organizing principle in her stories; she chose, instead, the more fabular, allegorical model of a writer like D. H. Lawrence. Finally, however, Lessing, like other women writers of the short story, kept in touch with the intuition of revelation in moments of being whose power act not only as organizers of narrative but also as significations of a kind of feminine sensory apprehension of temporality. This discursive implementation of the moment as the center of modernist women writers' short fiction may be recuperated so as to preserve their achievements from the preference for a decentered écriture féminine.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and the extension of anthropological research into the urban and industrial heartlands of the ' developed' world. These substantive consequences have established incontrovertibly the appropriateness and potency of anthropology in the study of such societies; and have also provided a basis from which to inform the core debates and central concepts of the discipline. These developments are evident in recent studies of kinship, social identity and symbolism. The reflexivity which is an essential ingredient of research on these topics (until recently noted with more eloquence and alacrity in France than in Britain) calls attention to the inevitable, and desirable, intrusion of the Self into anthropological research. It also demands the explicit incorporation of the complex Self-Other opposition in the fomulation of anthropological 'problems' — not as a baring of the post-modernist soul, but as an interpretive resource. An important illustration of the power of this resource may be found in the study of ethnic and local identities which are thereby revealed to be a matter of internal discourse (among Selves, so to speak) as well as of relativistic counter-definition. It is in precisely this way that research in anthropologists' 'parochial' or local milieux will contribute to the maturation of anthropology generally.<br>

Abstract: Since 1990, two eminent French-speaking sinologists, François Jullien and Jean François Billeter, have been engaged in a debate on the principles of comparative philosophy and sinology. The debate has been developed in several books and articles and attracted the attention of a relatively broad public as well as of a wide range of French intellectuals. The arguments with regard to an older discussion on the difference between philology and philosophy are evaluated here, and conclusions are drawn concerning the present status of comparative philosophy in academia.<br>

Abstract: This essay offers a history of a basic writing course that began at a public ivy campus in the 1970s. Relying on principles of universal design and on insights derived from his school's studio program about ways the institution's selective functions can impact curricular matters, the author describes how the basic writing course was merely retrofitted to an English Department's goals, rather than integrated into its mainstream business. In turn, the author suggests that historical studies such as this can help basic writing teachers excavate and reinvigorate demoaatic reform efforts often backgrounded in light of a school's elite reputation.<br>

Abstract: Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.<br>

Abstract: The analogy between Plato's notion of khora in the Timaeus and Derrida's notion of khora as a surname for différence should include the mythic elements described in the opening verses of Genesis. The elements are not an irrational chaos but provide a principle of indeterminacy that gives creation unprogrammability, risk, and the possibility of the event.<br>

Abstract: Here a moral principle called the "Copper Rule" is developed and defended as an alternative to the Golden Rule. First, the article focuses on two problems with the Golden Rule's traditional formulation of "Do (or don't do) unto others what you would (or would not) have them do unto you": it assumes (1) the uniformity of human needs and preferences and (2) that whatever is universally desired is good. Second, it examines three attempts to reformulate the Golden Rule-Marcus Singer's general interpretation, Allan Gewirth's rationalization, and R. M. Hare's imaginative role reversal-to show why they all fail to save the Golden Rule from difficulty. Third, the rich resources of the Chinese Confucian-Daoist philosophical traditions are appropriated to develop a "Copper Rule" as an alternative moral principle: "Do (or don't do) unto others as they would (or would not) have us do unto them." This moral principle not only avoids the two problems, but also has additional advantages. Finally, the "Copper Rule" is defended against three objections or counterarguments: what if people ask you (for example) (1) to kill someone else, (2) to kill them, or (3) to kill yourself? The appropriate response is merely to trace the implications of the "Copper Rule" rather than add any ad hoc arguments.<br>

Abstract: Modern critical theory is commonly thought of as a collection of diverse methods, schools, systems, and approaches. There is, however, a significant pattern in the diversity. This pattern is generated by the conflict between the widespread effort of twentieth-century theorists to make criticism scientific and the internal resistance to that effort presented by the hermeneutic impulse. The scientific tradition is characterized and unified by a set of common theoretical principles and by a common sequence of transformations that each school within it undergoes. The result of these transformations is that every proposed scientific model for criticism changes into an interpretive method and the project of scientific criticism is subverted.<br>

Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: The field of bioethics has been dominated by the tenets and assumptions of Western philosophical rationalistic thought. A principles and rights-based approach to discussions of moral dilemmas has sustained and reinforced a pervasive reductionism, utilitarianism, and ethnocentrism in the field. Recent explorations of casuistry and hermeneutics suggest a movement toward an expanded theoretical and conceptual framing of medical ethical problems. Increased attention to moral phenomenology and a recognition of the importance of social, cultural, and historical determinants that shape moral questioning should facilitate collaborative work between anthropologists and ethicists. In this article, I examine the philosophical orientation of U.S. bioethics and the relationship of the social sciences to the field of medical ethics. Deterrents to collaboration between anthropologists and bioethicists are explored. Finally, I review past and possible future contributions of anthropology to the field of bioethics and, more generally, to medical ethics.<br>

Abstract: Lévi-Strauss claims that the unconscious activity of mind is more important than the conscious one for understanding social phenomena and that the unconscious consists of an aggregate of forms, which are imposed on psychological and physical content. The real inspiration of Lévi-Strauss' notion is the Kantian notion of mental constraints and the postulate of isomorphism of mental and physical laws. The methodological usefulness of the unconscious as a principle of intelligibility is placed in evidence.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169
