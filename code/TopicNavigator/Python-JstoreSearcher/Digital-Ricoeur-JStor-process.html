  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  1  Policy Polysemy and the 1935 Social Security Debates from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: Americans know Social Security. They likely know it better than any other public policy. Whereas many policies appear distant from Americans’ everyday lives, seemingly addressed only to Washington insiders, Social Security touches ordinary citizens directly. For millions of Americans, Social Security has provided irreplaceable benefits to compensate for income lost through the tragic injury or death of a breadwinner. For millions more, Social Security has provided steady retirement benefits for oneself, a parent, or a grandparent, affirming, in the process, the honorific status of senior citizen. And virtually all Americans have experienced the rite of passage enacted by obtaining a<br>

  Abstract: In a press conference two days after his election to a second term, President Bush assessed the import of his victory: “I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it.” President Bush interpreted the election results as a clear expression of public opinion. Through their votes, citizens indicated their support for his policy agenda: “After hundreds of speeches and three debates and interviews and the whole process, where you keep basically saying the same thing over and over again, that—when you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced<br>

  The Ambivalence of Interreligious Historiography: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1vjqqj6">Mimetic Theory and World Religions</a><br>
  Author(s) Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Whatever the charges of imprecision that might be raised against the concept of “world religions,” there is one feature that religions claiming this title will necessarily share with one another: an explicit sense of their relation to several other religions with prima facie rights to this same claim. The self-understanding of each world religion is constituted in part by its understanding of other world religions. Precisely for Girardian theory, the perceived initial commonality that makes interrelationality and differentiation unavoidable also makes it likely from the start that world religions are not only expressions of how competitive processes internal to each<br>

  [III Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Abstract: One rewrites in order to improve a text. Sometimes the result is thought to be the better expression of an original meaning; at other times, it extends the idea in a new direction. In any case, textual revision is a process characterized by imperfection, change, negotiation, and fallibility. Traditionally, realism has seemed to be above this process: One identifies the relations of power or suffers the consequences. This attitude is reflected in the standard invocation of the classics of realism, which are seen as equivalent statements of a core doctrine of universal truths. From Thucydides to Machiavelli to Morgenthau, there<br>

  Book Title: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity-Trajectories of Israeli & Palestinian Symbol Use<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frank David A.<br>
  Abstract: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity: Trajectories of Israeli and Palestinian Symbol Useargues that rhetoric, ideology, and myth have played key roles in influencing the development of the 100-year conflict between first the Zionist settlers and the current Israeli people and the Palestinian residents in what is now Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is usually treated as an issue of land and water. While these elements are the core of the conflict, they are heavily influenced by the symbols used by both peoples to describe, understand, and persuade each other. The authors argue that symbolic practices deeply influenced the Oslo Accords, and that the breakthrough in the peace process that led to Oslo could not have occurred without a breakthrough in communication styles.Rowland and Frank develop four crucial ideas on social development: the roles of rhetoric, ideology, and myth; the influence of symbolic factors; specific symbolic factors that played a key role in peace negotiations; and the identification and value of criteria for evaluating symbolic practices in any society.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: Most symbol systems are created like a seabed through a process of sedimentation. The new symbol system simply develops over time from the old one. Thus, the symbolic system of American conservatism in the 1990s clearly has evolved from an earlier conservative perspective. In other cases, however, a new symbol system may be created in response to a strong exigency, a perceived crisis. In that circumstance, the failure of the existing system to solve the crisis leads to the development of a new (often revolutionary) system of rhetoric/ideology/myth.<br>

  Abstract: The slightly more than five-year period from Menachem Begin’s election as prime minister of Israel in 1977 through the war in Lebanon represents one of the most crucial periods in symbolic development in the history of Israel. This period was dominated by conflicting aspects of the Revisionist symbol system. On the one hand, Begin led Israel first to the Camp David Accords and then to a peace treaty with Egypt. In the development of the peace process, Begin’s rhetoric reflected the underlying myth of Holocaust and Redemption, including a strong commitment to maintaining Israeli control over Eretz Israel, but also<br>

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Author(s) FINNEGAN RUTH<br>
  Abstract: Though divination as such has had minimal impact on contemporary poetry, the underpinnings of divination in systematic chance procedures relate closely to processes used by experimental poets and artists, from the Dada work of Duchamp, Arp, and Tzara to its fuller development by Jackson Mac Low and John Cage. For this, the traditional system most drawn from is that of the Chinese I Ching, as modified by Carl Jungʹs speculation on ʺsynchronicity,ʺ the ʺacausal connectionsʺ between things happening at the same time (Wilhelm/Baynes 1950).

A projection of Surrealist yearning, the idea of a process, an ʺact of dreamingʺ by which ʺthe mind makes contact with whatever mystery it is that connects the Dreaming [the Eternal Dream Time] and the Here and Now,ʺ is fundamental to mythic thought throughout the world and is at its most developed in the traditions<br>

  Abstract: While they were held in detention facilities or treatment centers, most teenagers expressed an inflated sense of agency. Relying on the cultural narrative of the “American Dream,” they believed in their ability to desist from crime, even if the odds were stacked against them. Criminologists often overlook the role agency plays in the desistance process. Structural conditions can be measured and quantified reliably. Operationalizing agency is more difficult. Direct observations of criminal acts are ethically dubious. Even if researchers were able to witness a crime in the making, it would be impossible to generalize from isolated instances.

  Book Title: The Cosmic Time of Empire-Modern Britain and World Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Barrows Adam<br>
  Abstract: Combining original historical research with literary analysis, Adam Barrows takes a provocative look at the creation of world standard time in 1884 and rethinks the significance of this remarkable moment in modernism for both the processes of imperialism and for modern literature. As representatives from twenty-four nations argued over adopting the Prime Meridian, and thereby measuring time in relation to Greenwich, England, writers began experimenting with new ways of representing human temporality. Barrows finds this experimentation in works as varied as Victorian adventure novels, high modernist texts, and South Asian novels—including the work of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, H. Rider Haggard, Bram Stoker, Rudyard Kipling, and Joseph Conrad. Demonstrating the investment of modernist writing in the problems of geopolitics and in the public discourse of time, Barrows argues that it is possible, and productive, to rethink the politics of modernism through the politics of time.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn9nx">Postcolonial Disorders</a><br>
  Author(s) Hollifield Michael<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we examine the problem of subjectivity as a transformation of lived experience in the wake of civil warfare and formation of the postcolonial nation-state. The specific terms of subjective alteration—collectively imprinted as a clash of political ethos¹ and personally imprinted as a shattering of identity and sentiment—are considered in relation to a culturally produced anguish in the aftermath of a conflict. Our ethnographic illustration of this process is the well-known case of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.² Prior to this political formation in 1975, multiparty warfare was waged throughout a fractured nation, as anticommunist armies<br>

  Author(s) KLEINMAN ARTHUR<br>
  Abstract: This book is an extended conversation about contemporary forms of human experience and subjectivity. It examines the genealogy of what we consider to be the modern subject, and it inquires into the continuity and diversity of personhood across greatly diverse societies, including the ways in which inner processes are reshaped amid economic and political reforms, violence, and social suffering. It is an ethnographic conversation, with authors confronting specific forms of social life in particular settings, and it is a theoretical conversation, exploring the debates and disciplinary disagreements about how we think and write about human agency today.<br>

Scientific practices have been central to this transformation. Arendt argues that the experimental process that came to define the natural sciences—″the<br>

  Book Title: Carnal Thoughts-Embodiment and Moving Image Culture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Sobchack Vivian<br>
  Abstract: In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,
      Carnal Thoughtsshows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.Carnal Thoughtsprovides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.<br>

  Abstract: The familiar notion of a “later” Renaissance immediately presents itself as an innocent effort at chronological arrangement, as a convenience for determining relationships in time. But of course it is much more. It calls upon us to distinguish the differing characteristics of successive moments, to trace a process of development from inception to maturity and possibly on to decline; and it introduces the complicated problem of the relations between Italy and the Northern Renaissance.¹ It is thus closely connected with one of the most fruitful tendencies in all aspects of modern Renaissance scholarship: the effort to distinguish stages in a<br>

Secularization, like the rise of the middle class with which it is often associated,¹ has served for generations to describe a process perceived as crucial to the emergence of the modern world. It has not, however, occupied a very prominent or general place in studies dealing with the seventeenth century; hence this paper may be an opportunity to take a fresh look at a number of problems, among them the place assigned to the seventeenth century in recent historical thought.

  Abstract: A major problem for the historian of political thought in the period of the Renaissance is to trace the transition from the religious, idealistic, or constitutional ideas of the Middle Ages to the secular, realistic, or absolutist views of the early modern era.¹ A decade ago Felix Gilbert discussed this problem in connection with humanist political thought and its background in Italian political conditions.² But this evolution in political ideas was not confined to Italy, and this article proposes to examine the process in a writer from across the Alps, Philippe de Commynes.<br>

Faced with the problems of governing a turbulent but independent republic, anxious to insure her survival in a precarious world that seemed to be ruled only by power, and nourished by the rediscovered political culture of antiquity, thoughtful Florentines, in a process that reached a climax with Machiavclli and Guicciardini, began to articulate realistic principles of political effectiveness and to define its limits. In this sense Florence contributed to the education of modern Europe as a congeries of particular powers,<br>

  Author(s) Ghassem-Fachandi Parvis<br>
  Abstract: Scholars of Hindutva have argued that in the context of communal violence in India a heightened sense of vulnerability among members of the Hindu middle and lower middle class is integral to the legitimization of violence, where a “majority” feels threatened by a “minority” (Jaffrelot 1996; Hansen 1999; Nussbaum 2007).

  Abstract: By 1920, modern historical thought had reached a certain point of maturity. My aim in this chapter is to explain this process. With improved accessibility to new types of knowledge and completely new forms of intellectual organization, the perceptual tools of educated people were modified, at first quite slowly, but by 1919, quite decisively. Though it is yet too early to speak of a genre of modern history, the development of new linguistic resources, in fact an entire semantic field, was the crucial and final element that brought the historicization process to a mature point.

  Abstract: The tales of the neighborhood that have been the focus of this book tell about the “neighborhood” of the Galilee in the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era. This neighborhood was at the time the birthing-ground for major religious and cultural formations that would prove consequential for many groups and peoples on a number of continents. Our entry into this milieu through the concept of a neighborhood has stressed small-scale processes, such as human relations and everyday life, rather than the major events of the period.

  Author(s) Gooren Henri<br>
  Abstract: The emphasis in this chapter is on
                  howpeople tell the story of their conversion. I follow a historical and phenomenological approach to the conversion narrative, analyzing it as a social construction and not necessarily as a factual description of the main events in an individual’s life. A comprehensive conversion experience changes one’s self-image. This transformation, which is a process taking longer than just one day or one week, is gradually reflected in the most important indicator of conversion:biographical reconstruction.¹ People who undergo a conversion experience literally reconstruct their lives, giving new meanings to old events and putting different<br>

  Author(s) Cartledge Mark J.<br>
  Abstract: The discipline of practical theology is one that appears to be in constant redefinition in recent times, although there might at last be some consensus emerging. It was once regarded as the crown of theological study, placed toward the end of theological education for the ordained ministry. At this point in the process all the necessary “tips and hints” were added under the rubric

  Abstract: What I have described as transpacific displacement is a historical process of dislocation and relocation of cultural meanings via ethnography, translation, and intertextual travel. Interestingly, this complicated cross-over, of which Imagism’s appropriation and reinvention of “Chinese” poetics constitute an important part, now seems to have taken an unexpected turn: readers of contemporary Chinese poetry have been told that the work in front of them is influenced, inspired by Imagism. As the story goes, Chinese poets, such as Bei Dao and Gu Cheng, living in the poetic wasteland of the Cultural Revolution, turned to Western literature for inspiration. The books circulated<br>

  Abstract: Scholarly periodicals are important pacemakers and trendsetters in the process of academic professionalization and institutionalization: they not only reflect developments within scientific disciplines or their relationship to other scientific fields, they also influence such developments decisively by way of an active editorial policy.¹ Already in the course of the eighteenth century many journals dealing with ‘historical’ issues had been founded, i.e., treating genealogical, numismatic, and statistical contents.² Most of them were media of education which intended to spread and discuss established ideas within a circle of educated readers.³ At that time and also during the early years of the nineteenth<br>

  5  Interpretive Authority and Doctrinal Development from:

  Abstract: By whose “authority” does the church develop doctrine? What guide can aid in differentiating between positive developments and doctrinal distortions? By whose rule can we draw the line between orthodoxy and heterodoxy? The construction of doctrine in the broader Christian tradition and in systematic theology is a complex operation that involves many people over a great span of time with many disciplinary specialties and pastoral concerns. Naturalist interpretations of religion chalk all of these processes up to socio-cultural or bio-cultural factors. These are undirected by external forces and products of a human culture, a building of gods in the images<br>

  Abstract: Can we conceive of the apocalypse as something other than an ultimate compensation for defeat, loss, or weakness, as an event valuable and desirable for reasons other than the promised triumph of the godly? This is a particularly pressing question for a poem that promises (and, in its 1645 version, celebrates) the fall of its enemies and a future world of new pastures, all in the process of commemorating a friend’s death.
                  Lycidas, instead of responding to loss with mourning, consolation, or revolution, imagines this temporal event as essentially apocalyptic, an immanently and immediately apprehensible revelation. Especially in its later,<br>

  Abstract: I begin with an absolutely arbitrary and unwarranted assertion, namely, that given a distinction between metaphor and metonymy, the tendency to make metaphors is characteristic of the modern attitude, while the tendency to see metonymies is characteristic of the traditional attitude. Any traditional ambience that becomes a cosmos does so because it has been structured into a field for the perception of metonymies, has been organized, we might say, by the metonymizing process. Modernization (or disenchantment) is then the transformation of metonymies into metaphors; to modernize is to de-metonymize, to metaphorize. To re-traditionalize is to demetaphorize, to re-metonymize. The traditional<br>

In biblical studies, serious interest in myth typically falls under the domain of the secular academy, whereas serious interest in “Scripture” has typically been the concern for communities of faith and the academic institutions they support.

  Abstract: As communities continue to shape and reshape their collective memories, new events and information are constantly combined and integrated with previous knowledge to form flexible mental schemas. Representation of trauma and construction of collective identity are facilitated by these flexible, preexisting schemas. Memories of events run back and forth in time, from past to present and vice-versa, as more recent events and figures are associated with earlier ones (Schwartz 1991, 222, 233–34; van der Kolk and van der Hart 1995, 171; Yerushalmi 1996).

  Abstract: The folklore documentaryis ubiquitous. In a world bombarded by visual images, most of us have become not only receivers of the image but its manipulators as well. We take photographs, produce home movies, and shoot videotape of life’s events. Often, these visual documents represent the realm of folklore: they record such events as birthday parties, weddings, ethnic gatherings, and religious occasions. At the same time, the films and videos we create reveal much about ustous and others.¹ As a folklorist, filmmaker, and videographer, I believe the use of film and video becomes a reflexive process of interpreting<br>

How one chooses to present folklore shifts as a result of one’s growth as a filmmaker at the same time as one’s attitudes about film and technique shift.

  Abstract: The Shriek of Silenceis a first in several respects: the first to examine the Holocaust novels in their original languages, the first to articulate a theoretical basis for its approach, and the first phenomenological investigation -- one that attempts to penetrate the process of creation for these novelists. Organized along conceptual lines, the book examines "the word in exile," the themes of death of the father and the child, transformations of the self, and the implications of the reader. Its philosophical foundations are Rosenzweig, Buber, Neher, and Levinas. Its critical approach is shaped by Bakhtin.<br>

This maintenance must assure enough continuity of vision, value, and perception so that the community sustains its self-identity. At the same time, such maintenance must assure enough freedom and novelty so that the community can survive in and be pertinent to new circumstances.¹ Thus, education must attend to processes of both continuity and discontinuity in order to avoid fossilizing into irrelevance on the one hand, and relativizing into disappearance on the other<br>

But in doing so it has neglected the voice of religious dissenters and the significance of racial diversity within the ranks of American Christians. Likewise, social science and historical studies of immigrants and refugees tend to gloss over religious affiliation and focus mainly on adaptation or assimilation processes into American culture.

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Abstract: In his early career, Freud understood anxiety as a response to repression, but in a later work he reversed himself, arguing that anxiety is primary. In this chapter I argue that anxiety is fundamentally related to the body as well as to
                  jouissance, which refers to a fascination with the process of expelling body to create a subject orcogito. This bodily remainder, which sometimes takes the form of slime, generates enormous anxiety, at the individual, social, and theological levels.

  Book Title: Reading Descartes Otherwise: Blind, Mad, Dreamy, and Bad-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Kyoo<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the first four images of the Other mobilized in Descartes' Meditations--namely, the blind, the mad, the dreamy, and the bad--Reading Descartes Otherwise casts light on what have heretofore been the phenomenological shadows of "Cartesian rationality." In doing so, it discovers dynamic signs of spectral alterity lodged both at the core and on the edges of modern Cartesian subjectivity. Calling for a Copernican reorientation of the very notion "Cartesianism," the book's series of close, creatively critical readings of Descartes' signature images brings the dramatic forces, moments, and scenes of the cogito into our own contemporary moment. The author patiently unravels the knotted skeins of ambiguity that have been spun within philosophical modernity out of such cliches as "Descartes, the abstract modern subject" and "Descartes, the father of modern philosophy"--a figure who is at once everywhere and nowhere. In the process, she revitalizes and reframes the legacy of Cartesian modernity, in a way more mindful of its proto-phenomenological traces.<br>

Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamental critical issues and the landmark texts in which they play themselves out.<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

  Abstract: At the beginning of the new millennium, Soo-Young Chin, Peter X. Feng, and Josephine Lee discussed the increasing visibility of Asian American culture both inside and outside academia and consequently the growing complexity required to understand and assess Asian American cultural production. They raised key questions about what characterizes Asian American cultural production and how we understand, experience, and analyze Asian American culture (270). As Chin, Feng, and Lee have broadly defined it, the term “cultural production” refers to “processes by which certain subjects (Asian Americans and others) produce material objects, actions, and interactions; it pertains to the interpretation of<br>

  Abstract: Thierry Groensteen argues that “the narrative techniques and processes that are used in manga give the reader the feeling of being immersed in the action, whereas Western comics create a more distant relation between the reader and the narrative” (27). It goes without saying that both “Western” and “Eastern” graphic narratives escape such generalization. However, Angela Moreno Acosta’s redrawing of one sequence from Gene Luen Yang’s American Born Chinese visualizes what has come to dominate the global image of manga, including Groensteen’s, namely the assumption that this kind of comics is particularly qualified for highlighting emotions, moods, and private interpersonal<br>

  Book Title: Edgar Allen Poe: A Phenomenological View-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HALLIBURTON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The book begins with a methodological chapter that sets out the assumptions and procedures of the approach. This is followed by analyses of Poe's major works, exploring such special problems as Poe's treatment of the material world, including technology; the interrelation of body and consciousness; poetic voice; attitudes toward women; and the will to affirmation, plenitude, and unity. The center of interest is neither Poe's biography nor environment but always the meaning of Poe's words. Because these works are shaped by a single imagination and because they are experienced in time, as a process, each work has its own "way of going." The aim of the interpretation is to find this way and go along with it; to live each work dynamically, as it "happens," while tracing its interaction with other works.<br>

  Abstract: Academics and practitioners working in international economic development often cite the critical role of empowerment within development; however, relatively little attention has been paid to institutional power.¹ Institutionalized power plays an important role in generating, reinforcing, and reproducing the inequalities that prevent or limit various groups of individuals—most notably women—from acting as agents, engaging in empowerment processes, or being empowered. In other words, we cannot adequately address the role of empowerment with development without properly understanding the role of institutionalized power in empowerment.

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash against Westernization that was expressed as a longing for the past. By focusing on the expressions of these desires in popular culture and media texts, it reveals how the conflation of mother, countryside, everyday life, and history structured representations to naturalize ideologies of gender and nationalism.<br>

  Abstract: The Meiji period was a time of intense social and cultural transformation. The acceleration of history and endless renewal of fashion created a sense of disjuncture and difference that allowed Meiji Japan to imagine itself as the victim of a deformative process of cultural loss and foreign invasion. Fashion is above all else a ritual of forgetting that celebrates novelty and obliviousness to the past.¹ Pierre Nora argues that a memorial consciousness emerges under just such conditions wherein society becomes deeply absorbed in its own transformation and renewal. According to Nora, this condition is “one that inherently values the new<br>

  Book Title: Building a Heaven on Earth-Religion, Activism, and Protest in Japanese Occupied Korea<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Park Albert L.<br>
  Abstract: Why and how did Korean religious groups respond to growing rural poverty, social dislocation, and the corrosion of culture caused by forces of modernization under strict Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945)? Questions about religion's relationship and response to capitalism, industrialization, urbanization, and secularization lie at the heart of understanding the intersection between colonialism, religion, and modernity in Korea. Yet, getting answers to these questions has been a challenge because of narrow historical investigations that fail to study religious processes in relation to political, economic, social, and cultural developments. In
      Building a Heaven on Earth, Albert L. Park studies the progressive drives by religious groups to contest standard conceptions of modernity and forge a heavenly kingdom on the Korean peninsula to relieve people from fierce ruptures in their everyday lives. The results of his study will reconfigure the debates on colonial modernity, the origins of faith-based social activism in Korea, and the role of religion in a modern world.<br>

  Abstract: For a long time the computer was a tool for experts, inaccessible and also prohibitively expensive for private users. This changed in the mid-1980s. The increasingly widespread use of the computer and the growing experience of its users have since led to a new kind of interaction. In many cases the computer is no longer seen as a machine with which well-planned, methodical, or repetitive tasks are conducted. The interaction¹ with it is now perceived as an open-ended process characterized by creative, explorative, goal-oriented, and challenging activities. Connected with this process is self-directed learning, experimental tinkering around, and the self-gambling<br>

Indeed, being cross-examined by Slobodan Milosovic or simply being exposed to the intrinsic harshness of the adversarial criminal justice process is not likely to be “healing” to participating victims. In criminal courts, victims’ testimony is constantly cut short, and they are asked to focus on the forensic details. Indeed, the main reason for their presence in court is not to tell their story and have it validated publicly, but rather to provide a piece of the evidence in relation to which the question of the guilt<br>

It is most frequently seen as an economic-technological process of time-space compression, as a social modernization of increased cultural homogeneity previously national in character scaled up to the world as a whole, or as shorthand for the practices of economic liberalism spontaneously adopted by governments the world over.¹ I do not want to deny the truth in<br>

The former stands for a seemingly autonomous process of globe shrinking or stretching (depending on how you look at it), whereas the latter indicates a self-conscious extraction and movement of profit from some places to others through political domination and coercion more than economic rationality.

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>

  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

  Abstract: The city of Cairo, like all global mega-cities, is entrenched in processes of globalization where flows of labor, capital, and information are re-shaping its physical boundaries, the structure of the economy, and its political landscape.¹ The Egyptian state seeks to remake itself as the “Tiger on the Nile,” a growth engine that will not only sustain Egypt’s regional dominance but also propel it to become a truly global capital, drawing investment for its industry, franchises, services, and new ‘planned’ cities in the desert. The country’s heritage and its monuments attract millions of tourists annually, and tourism has become a pillar<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15m7n61">Cairo Contested</a><br>
  Author(s) Mehrez Samia<br>
  Abstract: Given the dominance of the realist tradition in Egyptian literature, it is no surprise that Cairo, whether it is the historic city or the modern metropolis, should be the main metaphor for much of the literary production during the twentieth century. Urban space, for the writers of the city, has been a major architect of its social, economic, and political fabric. At one level, the city of Cairo emerges as an actor with real agency that embodies and structures social power, as well as political, economic, and symbolic processes. Cairo is not simply a physical presence that writers reproduce. Rather,<br>

  Author(s): Nolette Nicole<br>
  Abstract: L' « hétérolinguisme » - c'est-à-dire l'inscription de la variabilité linguistique - de ces pièces de théâtre franco-canadiennes est le plus souvent compréhensible pour les lecteurs et les publics bilingues locaux. Néanmoins, la diffusion de telles pièces et, par ricochet, leur légitimation auprès des métropoles théâtrales canadiennes au fonctionnement surtout unilingue, auront à passer par des traductions en supplément à celles auxquelles leurs jeux bilingues leur permettent déjà de s'adonner. Il est possible que, pour atteindre la légitimation par les institutions dominantes grâce à la traduction, « les cultures de l'exiguïté sacrifient ce qu'elles possèdent de plus radicalement créateur1 », c'est-à-dire l'inscription du traduisible et l'hétérolinguisme ludique.

  12  A Kaleidoscopic Biography of an Ordinary Landscape from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3x99">Landscape Biographies</a><br>
  Author(s) de Jong John<br>
  Abstract: Reconstructing the biography of a landscape is like trying to unscramble a scrambled egg. You just cannot do it. Due to the variety of authors, the multiplicity of their actions, as well as the evolving condition of social relations, any attempt to unravel the social processes that underlie the transformation of our physical world is reckless. Moreover, it would be an impossible challenge to describe in detail the reverse impact the environment had on the knowledge, perceptions and practices of people that lived in the past. In addition to this complexity regarding the interpretation of the cultural dimension of landscape,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3x99">Landscape Biographies</a><br>
  Author(s) Riesto Svava<br>
  Abstract: The city always changes. Urban projects are interventions in the city’s dynamics. Each urban project alters a part of the city – its materiality and contexts and how we perceive and understand it. Heritage experts and designers involved in such processes constantly make choices as to which qualities of a site are discarded or reused and how this happens. These assessments and the values that they are based on are, however, not always articulated and openly discussed.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3xt2">Narrative Criminology</a><br>
  Author(s) HAYWARD KEITH J.<br>
  Abstract: Set against today’s many true crime autobiographies—the type of sensationalist, tell-all accounts of life as a violent gangster or football hooligan that stare down at us from the shelves of main street and airport bookshops—the confession of a theft of pears by St. Augustine in AD 397 seems entirely innocuous, innocent even. Yet, if we leave aside the important distinction that exists between the reverent contrition of Augustine and the self-aggrandizement associated with, say, contemporary “hooli-lit” (Fischer 2006), it is clear that, as long as society has recognized the concept of crime, a shadow process of making sense<br>

  Author(s) Winter Sean F<br>
  Abstract: This article surveys Bonhoeffer’s early education in biblical studies, with a focus on his different encounters with Adolf Schlatter and Karl Barth. I propose that Bonhoeffer’s understanding of the tools of the historical-critical method in relation to a theologically focussed form of biblical interpretation was formed in this initial period, and that the relationship between history and revelation that he landed upon was not antithetical but complementary. Historical criticism was the servant of interpreting the Bible as revealed Scripture, but it was nevertheless an essential aspect of the interpretative process.

  Abstract: In October 1960 the Preparatory Theological Commission that began the process that would ultimately issue in the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation presented a working paper bearing the significant title:
                  A Compendious Schema for the Constitution on the Sources of Revelation.¹ Famously, the Dogmatic Constitution itself would reject the (traditional) notion of Scripture and Tradition as two separate sources (fontes) of Revelation and assert that ‘Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture are tightly connected and linked with one another.

  Abstract: Standardisation is necessary for coordinated group activity. There must be some fixed point or process that keeps the diverse members of the group acting in concert. With regard to the sacred text of the Bible, the translator is called to be faithful to the text. Yet as the Word of God, the message is communicated by God’s speaking it and the members of the community hearing it. The letters on the page participate in this communicative act and facilitate it as a fixed point within the process of communication. The translation of God’s Word via human words is more than<br>

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t9t9">Opening the Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: The Holy Grail of biblical interpretation should be the meaning of a text: the best insight the interpreter can offer, after all the acumen of scholarship has been brought to bear, as to what the text is doing or saying.¹ Like the Grail itself, meaning proves elusive to those who engage in its quest. It is easy to make archaeological, geographical, and historical comments or to note critical and linguistic issues. It is quite another question to lay bare one’s conviction as to a text’s meaning. The process tends to lay bare the interpreter’s being.²<br>

It is not possible here to detail all theaspectsrelated to the dissemination of colonial representations—illustrated newspapers, postcards, illustrations in various works, games, stamps,¹ and others— but the evidence does confirm that representations of colonized peoples, along with those of colonial spaces, were disseminated thanks to such materials.

  Author(s) Blanchard Pascal<br>
  Abstract: In her postabolition analysis of the memorial process of slavery in the “former colonies,” Myriam Cottias describes a “politics of forgetting.”1 Can the same description be applied to colonial history? The expression “politics of
                  forgetting”¹ suggests a conscious will to cover up; in the case of colonial history, forgetting appears to be more of a complex and multifaceted process—about which the successive heads of state were fully aware, for it was this forgetting that upheld the myth of the Republic’s “civilizing mission” overseas—than a “plot” or even a “policy.” However, more than fifty years after the defeat at<br>

  Author(s) Etienne Bruno<br>
  Abstract: In these troubled times when the question of memorial laws triggers emotional and polemic responses and when a president of the Republic (in this case Jacques Chirac) reclaimed the term “Civilization,” it seems legitimate to examine the anamnesis of a process that for too long has been buried in our subconscious as a result of amnesty laws and our collective amnesia. This process has its origins in our connection to those colonies that, during two centuries, marked our history, and that are today imprinted on all aspects of French society through the multiple legacies of

  Author(s) Geisser Vincent<br>
  Abstract: In the 1980s and 1990s,
                  integrationbecame a catchword, an incontrovertible refrain in political discourse for government intervention, used by nonprofit organizations, social experts, and researchers.1 Though historically a highly charged term, this “notion” has annihilated the possibility of critical distance. Integrationist rhetoric has functioned as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, finding its justification in its very enunciation. The sociologist Dominique Schnapper, now a member of the Constitutional Council, wrote the following in 1991: “By definition, no matter the national ideology, the nation constructs itself through a process of continuous integration.

  Abstract: For the most part, it seems that we approach reading as if it were neutral in all valences of any consequence: language or other sign indicators on the screen or page are touched, usually by vision, and then processed by the synaptic workings of the brain for the purpose of transfer of information. And often all of this happens without awareness, even at times the very choice of what we read. Here, there is

  Author(s) RIGNALL KAREN<br>
  Abstract: When ethnographies assume polished form, the process of selecting a field site usually appears to have been a serendipitous alignment of intellectual commitments and affective attachments. The “arrival narrative” begins to take shape in those first days at the field site. As the narrative becomes fixed in the published ethnography, the anthropologist’s cultural connection—that commitment to people and place—becomes naturalized. In retrospect, the relationship can appear inevitable, even foreordained. My choice of field sites had more to do with day care than serendipity.<br>

Bringing ecocriticism closer to the material turn, the contributions to this landmark volume focus on material forces and substances, the agency of things, processes, narratives and stories, and making meaning out of the world. This broad-ranging reflection on contemporary human experience and expression provokes new understandings of the planet to which we are intimately connected.<br>

The answer to this question is simple. Whether visible or invisible, socialized or wild, they are all material forms emerging in combination with forces, agencies, and other matter.

  Abstract: The conception of physical reality within the framework of ecological postmodern thought and the nature of the material world described by quantum theory have recently been given new life by the emergence of the new materialist paradigm. The radical revisions of our ideas about the description of physical entities, chemical and biological processes, and their ethical, political, and cultural implications represented in recent discourses of feminist science studies, posthumanism, and the environmental humanities have also occasioned considerable interest among ecocritics, leading to the emergence of material ecocriticism.

                  all around, through,andin us.With the ecology of colors, I therefore explore nature in terms of dynamic material and informational exchanges. There is no doubt that the scenic places traditionally viewed as “nature” are rapidly being transformed—destroyed, developed, logged, mined, polluted. Yet boundedplacesare not the trope here.

Yet, given the profound commitment of Indonesians to the principles of democracy, Catholics have often found themselves at the table of political and civic discourse and involved in the processes of democratization. Nevertheless, the contributions Catholics have made to Indonesian society and government have always remained in the shadow of their minority status.

The final section of this volume attempts a response to these questions by turning to the notion of praxis. A praxis-oriented approach is one that combines the theoretical and the practical, so that they may mutually inform and correct each other in the dialectical process of deliberation.

  Abstract: Luther seems to have many faces—in part, for external reasons. He lived in a turbulent time of profound transformations in all sectors: in culture, economy, social and political order, religion, and in morality. Luther never had the privilege or the misfortune of being able to reflect with an inner or outer distance on the historical process in upheaval. Not only was he forced to think, speak, and act in the middle of events; the facts themselves, so to speak, rained down on him, while others barreled him over. Generally, however, he retained a peculiar and surprising freedom of belief<br>

  Abstract: This chapter crosses a frontier in divination research by showing the
                     practiceof wisdom divination through a series of séances. On the basis of my earlier account of Moatlhodi’s archive, I turn to divination as an interpretive process of highly artful deliberation about moral peril. This makes persuasive reasoning and argument the focus, rather than the so-called politics of divination, the mere jockeying of interested parties to get a preferred outcome, for example, a witchcraft accusation (see chapter 1). Such manipulation, now all too familiar in divinatory studies, remains in the background, although still evident.<br>

  Book Title: Evil in Africa-Encounters with the Everyday<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): PARKIN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: William C. Olsen, Walter E. A. van Beek, and the contributors to this volume seek to understand how Africans have confronted evil around them. Grouped around notions of evil as a cognitive or experiential problem, evil as malevolent process, and evil as an inversion of justice, these essays investigate what can be accepted and what must be condemned in order to evaluate being and morality in African cultural and social contexts. These studies of evil entanglements take local and national histories and identities into account, including state politics and civil war, religious practices, Islam, gender, and modernity.<br>

  Abstract: Although obsolescence is central to capitalist economies from at least the 1940s to the present, it is not peculiar to the post-1945 period. The same is true of its twin, innovation, the precursor of which is invention.¹ Innovation and obsolescence, at their most general, refer to twinned processes of technological change that play out across most periods of human history. We typically think of these twins as a smoothly forward-moving sequence of technical advances that have improved functionality and efficiency (innovation), displacing and depreciating the use-value of that which came before with the improvements that they create (obsolescence).

  Abstract: A common response to transgression is confusion about how one goes about the process of forgiveness and, perhaps more centrally, whether one should forgive at all (Tracy 1999; Mullet, Girard, and Bakhshi 2004). Consider Simon Wiesenthal’s

  Abstract: In social reality, the processes of fetishisation and de-fetishisation (resistance and struggle) are composed of multiple discourses that legitimise, strengthen and configure them with the break from domination. The constitution of social reality is constantly being transformed, due to conflict, tensions and shifts between power(s) and counter-power(s). However, after more than five centuries of imperial, colonial and capitalist domination and exploitation, we observe that the political asymmetry, economic inequality and ethno-racial injustice have become more acute in peripheral societies.

The growth of nationalism and nation-building has been, and still is, an important, spectacular and highly consequential dimension of the worldwide processes of change connected with colonialism and decolonisation. Nationalism is a kind of ideology which exists almost everywhere in the world, although it assumes very different forms and varies in significance.

  Book Title: Blaming the Victim-How Global Journalism Fails Those in Poverty<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Lugo-Ocando Jairo<br>
  Abstract: Poverty, it seems, is a constant in today's news, usually the result of famine, exclusion or conflict. In Blaming the Victim, Jairo Lugo-Ocando sets out to deconstruct and reconsider the variety of ways in which the global news media misrepresent and decontextualise the causes and consequences of poverty worldwide. The result is that the fundamental determinant of poverty - inequality - is removed from their accounts. The books asks many biting questions. When - and how - does poverty become newsworthy? How does ideology come into play when determining the ways in which 'poverty' is constructed in newsrooms - and how do the resulting narratives frame the issue? And why do so many journalists and news editors tend to obscure the structural causes of poverty? In analysing the processes of news production and presentation around the world, Lugo-Ocando reveals that the news-makers' agendas are often as problematic as the geopolitics they seek to represent. This groundbreaking study reframes the ways in which we can think and write about the enduring global injustice of poverty.<br>

  Abstract: Despite journalistic normative claims that news accounts on poverty are driven by a quest for social justice, the way poverty is articulated today by the global news media is instead a convergent by-product of more down-to-earth organisational dynamics and interests that happen within the newsrooms. First, we can point to the media’s editorial and news policies, which are shaped by a multiplicity of interests and objectives; second, we have the ideological interventions and approaches of journalists and editors in the process of news gathering and dissemination; and, third, the framing provided by news sources and news shapers in the construction<br>

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Book Title: Locating Cultural Creativity-  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Liep John<br>
  Abstract: The contributors to this volume reexamine the interconnectedness of culture and creativity in an increasingly hybrid world. They argue that while many of the old certainties about high culture and artistic canons may now be disintegrating, culture and creativity themselves are still very much a reflection of social processes involving power and the control of resources. Case studies include youth subcultures in Europe; experimental theatre derived from the Brazilian candomblé dance; the role of memory in mythology among the Pukapukan of Polynesia; the evolution of football and polo in Argentina; gender relations in Algerian raï music; the notion of authenticity in artistic movements in Zanzibar; traditional and modern practices of the Lio in Indonesia; and kula exchange and social movements in the Trobriand Islands in the Pacific.<br>

  Author(s) Hastrup Kirsten<br>
  Abstract: In anthropology, the notion of creativity has received renewed attention in recent years. Partly in response to the general historicization of the subject matter which took place during the 1980s, anthropologists have turned towards the processes of change inherent in any society. Cultural creativity is investigated as an ever-emergent feature in the world (Wagner 1981), and it is generally acknowledged that the ‘healthy perpetuation of cultural traditions requires invention as well as rote repetition’ (Rosaldo et al. 1993:5).<br>

  Abstract: How does one locate ‘cultural creativity’? Where does one search? Just trying to define the phrase – so one has a clear sense of what one is after – is enough to muddle the process. Regarding culture, for example, Hatch notes: ‘Even though the term has been discussed in countless books and articles, there is still a large degree of uncertainty in its use – anthropologists employ the notion in fundamentally different ways’ (1973:1). Likewise, ambiguity surrounds creativity. My dictionary equates creativity with inventiveness, bringing something new into being, originating.

  Book Title: Practicing the City: Early Modern London on Stage-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Levine Nina<br>
  Abstract: In late-sixteenth-century London, the commercial theaters undertook a novel experiment, fueling a fashion for plays that trafficked in the contemporary urban scene. But beyond the stage's representing the everyday activities of the expanding metropolis, its unprecedented urban turn introduced a new dimension into theatrical experience, opening up a reflexive space within which an increasingly diverse population might begin to "practice" the city. In this, the London stage began to operate as a medium as well as a model for urban understanding. Practicing the City traces a range of local engagements, onstage and off, in which the city's population came to practice new forms of urban sociability and belonging. With this practice, Levine suggests, city residents became more self-conscious about their place within the expanding metropolis and, in the process, began to experiment in new forms of collective association. Reading an array of materials, from Shakespeare and Middleton to plague bills and French-language manuals, Levine explores urban practices that push against the exclusions of civic tradition and look instead to the more fluid relations playing out in the disruptive encounters of urban plurality.<br>

  8  Writing Métissage in New Caledonian Non-Kanak Literatures: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18kr78q">The Literatures of the French Pacific</a><br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth-century novels set in New Caledonia,
                  métissage, as the process and outcome of racial mixing, was most particularly associated with women characters, and largely characterized by sexual permissiveness and biological degeneration. The earliest written literature in New Caledonia was, for the most part, produced by Metropolitan French people passing through. Louise Michel, considered in Chapters 1 and 2, spent eight years in the country’s penitentiary system, leaving New Caledonia after the general amnesty to rejoin her ailing mother in France.

What each population supposedly knows about the other is affected by images influenced by the social media and by groups with economic and political power on both sides of the island of Hispaniola, groups who propagate the idea that each of these two countries is a threat to the other.<br>

  Abstract: Introduced with the liberation of Nelson Mandela from prison in February 1990, the new political dispensation in South Africa has brought an acknowledgment of the diversity of cultures, languages, and religions. The infamous success of the apartheid ideology as a social engineering process lay exactly in the area of cultural refutation in which the social interaction was regulated in terms of four “racial” groups—so-called white, black, colored, and Indian people. More recently, the acknowledgment of the diversity of culture, language, and religion has become one of the building blocks of the new democracy. Generally speaking, South Africans have come<br>

  Abstract: In 2009 a pilot project was launched to determine whether adolescent readers could benefit from the process of intercultural Bible reading in ways similar to those reported by adult readers. The focus of the research with the adolescents also attempted to measure whether the reading process would be catalytic to the spiritual growth of the participants. For the purposes of the study, the concept of spiritual growth was originally defined along axes that included a deepened sense of belief, an observable increase in theological knowledge, and an increase in the amount of Christian activities.

Sliding across a series of binaries, Žižek articulates the difference between “true” philosophers and “madmen”<br>

  Book Title: Medium, Messenger, Transmission-An Approach to Media Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krämer Sybille<br>
  Abstract: Medium, Messenger, Transmissionuses the figure of the messenger as a key metaphor for the function of all transmission media. Sybille Krämer illustrates this argument with a diverse range of situations involving some form of transmission, including the circulation of money, the translation of languages, the spread of infectious diseases, processes of transference and countertransference as seen in psychoanalysis, and even the development of cartography. This rich study provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of media philosophy while illuminating transmission media as active mediators in all systems of exchange.<br>

  Abstract: Up until now I have been dealing with forms of transmission in widely diverse fields. I have also been dealing with forms of transmission that are not obviously subject to the regime of a medium, like radio or television, as this – albeit entirely random – selection of transmission modalities was designed to trace by analogy the functional logic of the messenger precisely where the mediality of this process was not at all obvious.

  Abstract: Nature is an epic historical narrative—from cosmic beginnings 13 billion years ago in the Big Bang to the emergence of planet earth, its life forms, and the emergence of humans and our culture. A focus on specific segments of the epic may lose sight of the grand epic narrative, which presents us with unimaginable diversity, from cosmic origins to the molecular structure of life, the amazing gamut of living creatures, primates, and human culture. Our basic assumption is that this is one process, one natural hiMstory—nature’s epic. We can speak of it as a drama in several acts<br>

  Book Title: Studi su Max Weber-1980-2002<br>
  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Bianco Adele<br>
  Abstract: Le questioni affrontate nei saggi raccolti in questo volume definiscono il vasto raggio degli interessi teorici di Max Weber e la fitta rete di influenze e rapporti della sua opera con quella di eminenti filosofi quali Rickert, Scheler, Lukács, Heidegger, Gadamer e Ricoeur. Il fulcro comune alle tematiche trattate può considerarsi il processo di razionalizzazione quale caratteristica identitaria, secondo Weber, della cultura occidentale e forza motrice della modernità. Esso trova il suo radicamento nell’antichità, ovvero nel passaggio dalla religiosità magica alla religiosità etica con cui si è avviato il processo di disincanto del mondo. Al tramonto di qualsiasi forma di assolutizzazione e alla parallela relativizzazione della razionalità si riallaccia uno dei primi temi weberiani discussi nel volume: il politeismo dei valori. Accanto ad esso emergono la teoria dei tipi ideali e la riforma dell’ermeneutica. La costruzione idealtipica, centro nevralgico della metodologia di Weber, è la via da lui tentata di contemperare in un’ardua sintesi intuizione e logica, interpretazione e spiegazione causale. L’attribuzione di una base ermeneutica al metodo della ricerca sociale significa inoltre sottrarre il processo di comprensione e il Verstehen al loro ancoraggio, di ispirazione diltheyana, «nell’immedesimazione simpatetica dell’esperienza vissuta» rendendoli strumento di procedimenti conoscitivi non più basati su soggettivismo e individualismo, ma la cui valenza oggettiva è verificata e garantita dall’intersoggettività.<br>

  Abstract: In the decade between 1395 and 1405, Christine de Pizan successfully established herself as a major figure in French literary history. This process necessarily involved a complex coming to terms with the dominant discursive practices of the late-medieval literary tradition: the creation of a new and distinctive voice within the context of this tradition. For Christine, this posed a special set of problems. It was not simply a question of attaining and demonstrating her formal mastery of various established literary genres. Her identity as a woman inevitably problematized her status as an “official” speaking subject in all of these generic<br>

  6  Interpreting Scripture for Preaching from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgg2f">Ways of the Word</a><br>
  Author(s) Brown Sally A.<br>
  Abstract: Scripture has been the indispensable, authorizing source of Christian sermons since Christianity’s beginnings. The sermons of Peter, Stephen, and Paul in Acts all draw on Old Testament texts. The book of Hebrews, thought by some to be a collection of early Christian sermons, draws on material across the Old Testament, especially the Psalms. This chapter provides you with a disciplined, prayerful, and scholarly process for engaging Scripture. Exegetical work (close grammatical, historical, and theological study of a text) is supported in this method by meditative Scripture reading using the centuriesold process called
                     lectio divina(“divine reading”).<br>

  Book Title: Horror and Its Aftermath-Reconsidering Theology and Human Experience<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Stamper Sally<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology often brings psychology to bear on the contingent nature of human existence in relationship to God. In this volume, Sally Stamper articulates one modern trajectory of theological recourse to psychology (comprising Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, and Tillich) as the ground on which she brings clinical psychoanalytic theory and early childhood studies into conversation with fundamental questions about the relationship of God to human suffering and its remediation. She develops her argument from the assertions that human experience evolves within an awareness of human vulnerability to profound suffering and that insight into consequent human anxiety is a powerful resource for soteriology, eschatology, and theological anthropology. Stamper narrates this “normative anxiety" by integrating object relations theories of early childhood development and critical readings of literary texts for young children. She gestures toward a new eschatological vision that poses the radical otherness of a transcendent God as key to divine remediation of human suffering, in the process building on Marilyn McCord Adams’s soteriological response to human horror-participation and on Jonathan Lear’s assertion of radical hope in response to catastrophic collapse of cultural resources for making meaning.<br>

  Abstract: Understanding can occur only within a specific context, under particular conditions, and with some guiding assumptions. A central task of critical hermeneutics is to consider these factors and address their impact. The (mostly unthematized) contextual conditions of the attempt to understand show up in many places: in the standpoint of the interpreter, in the process of interpretation, in that which is assumed to be already understood, and also, most decisively, in how the

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

There is not a particular area of the brain or specific pattern of brain activity associated with religious experiences. Rather, as Brown and Strawn suggest: “there are a multitude of forms of body and brain activity that can mediate and embody religious experiences and the sense of the presence of God, but any particular brain-body event is experienced as religious or not based on the person’s expectations and ways of understanding their subjective experiences.”¹ The way we understand theology<br>

They made use of image schemas, frames, idealized cognitive models, prototypes, conceptual metaphors, metonymy, and conceptual blending. Biblical texts manifest the conceptual conventions present in their languages and cultures. This includes everything from grammar to moral reasoning to cosmology. Much can be learned about how different biblical writers conceived various topics by paying attention to the conceptual structures prompted by the texts.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b7x4qv">The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things</a><br>
  Abstract: Accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is a concrete historical process of knowing the world and knowing oneself and reforming the world and refining oneself, which simultaneously generates meaning and produces a world of meaning. The world in-itself cannot pose for itself the question of meaning, which is to say that there is no way to dissociate meaning from one’s own being. Humans question the meaning of the world and the meaning of their own being; therefore, the genesis of meaning owes its origin to the “being” of humans. As the introduction to this book has already demonstrated, from the perspective<br>

  Abstract: Directed at the genesis of a world of meaning, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things unfolds throughout the whole process of one’s being. But as the basic way in which human being exists, how is this process possible? The question “How is it possible?” primarily concerns grounds and conditions. Here, the capacities of human being intrinsically condition the genesis of a world of meaning as the internal conditions of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things. Similar to “wisdom,” the phrase “human capacities” has its everyday connotations, but as a concept, it has philosophical meaning as well. In everyday terms, just as being<br>

  Abstract: The historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things, as we have seen, is internally conditioned by human capacities, but many forms of normative systems condition it as well. On the one hand, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things concretely unfolds as a process of knowing and practicing, which involves different senses of normativity. On the other hand, the knowledge and wisdom formed through this process further constrain knowing and practicing by means of externalizing, transforming into universal systems of norms. Directed at knowing the world and the self and changing both the self and the world, norms not only involve<br>

  Abstract: Conditioned by the interrelation of human capacities with systems of norms, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things constitutes human being’s basic way of being and mode of being. In the historical unfolding of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things, the presentation of things and the directionality of intentions reciprocally interact; the world enters the realm of ideas through this interaction and henceforth becomes being with meaning. As noted earlier, the problem of meaning does not occur to the world in-itself; rather, the source of meaning lies in the historical process of one coming to know the world and oneself while transforming both<br>

As the externalization or actualization of meaning, this domain of being, which is generated through the process of knowing and practicing could also be seen as the actual or external formation of a world of meaning, whose actual content is the Nature for-humans or things-for-us as social reality or the living world.<br>

  Abstract: Grounded in the historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things, a world of meaning may take shape into different forms. Whether it is exhibited internally in the form of ideas or unfolds externally into humanized reality, a world of meaning is always inseparable from the being of humans. Now, when considering the relation between the being of humans and a world of meaning, the individual or the person is an important aspect that cannot be ignored, because a world of meaning is first opened up and presented to the concrete individual or person.

  Abstract: Free individuality, human capacities, and inner state of mind most directly involve the personal space of the self but also in a broader sense the distinction and interaction between the individual domain and the public sphere. As interrelated aspects of the social world, the individual domain and its connection to the public sphere also sets the concrete background for the historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things. As the actual mode of being, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is never separable from diverse social resources, and the acquisition, possession, and distribution of resources involves the issue of social justice.<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Abstract: After our initial look at how certain aspects of Hegel’s account of desire might transform the concept of individuality, we turned to possible repercussions for his theories of juridical ordering and the state. Then, a third textual movement attempted an articulation of subjectivity, history and infinity, the foremost aim of which was to show that the Hegelian subject exceeds all egological reductions, analytics of finitude or anthropological limitations. That is to say, Hegel leaves us with a subject sufficiently inclusive to allow for both reflections on models of institutional association, as well as modes of determination or the process of<br>

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  Abstract: Writers of fiction often rely on their imagination in their work, and professional writers are able to recreate scenes, events, and incidents of actual or imagined wars by imagining them. In contrast, some of those who experience war first hand, especially as combat soldiers, write about those experiences using the format of memoirs, and on occasion in the form of novels and short stories. The creative process for these veterans who have become writers of fiction is the reverse to that of what I have called professional writers.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bmzn6b">The Adventures of Jonathan Dennis</a><br>
  Abstract: This work explores the philosophy and nature of film archiving in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) through an analysis of the role played by Jonathan Dennis, firstly at the New Zealand Film Archive, Ngā Kaitiaki o ngā Taonga Whitiāhua (NZFA), from 1981 until 1990 and thereafter as a freelance film curator until his death in 2002. The construction of a film archive in the early 1980s offers a valuable moment in which to analyse the wider purpose and the more specific process for the formation of a film archive. As a national institution presenting materials from the past, an archive quickly<br>

  Book Title: Moving Images-From Edison to the Webcam<br>
  Publisher: John Libbey Publishing<br>
  Author(s): Widding Astrid Söderbergh<br>
  Abstract: In 1888, Thomas Edison announced that he was experimenting on "an instrument which does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear, which is the recording and reproduction of things in motion." Just as Edison's investigations were framed in terms of the known technologies of the phonograph and the microscope, the essays in this collection address the contexts of innovation and reception that have framed the development of moving images in the last 100 years. Three concerns are of particular interest: the contexts of innovation and reception for moving image technologies; the role of the observer, whose vision and cognitive processes define some of the limits of inquiry and epistemological insight; and the role of new media, which, engaging with the domestic sphere as cultural interface, are transforming our understanding of public and private spheres.<br>

  Video Pleasure and Narrative Cinema: from:

  Author(s) Buckland Warren<br>
  Abstract: Jerome Bruner reminds us that narrative is not a contingent, optional dimension of society, but is an essential, ecologically necessary structure with which individuals make sense of social complexity.² We do not need to subscribe to ontological structuralism – which argues that narrative is a timeless structure that transcends society – to accept this level-headed reminder. In the process of structuring social experience, narrative necessarily reinvents itself in each epoch, offering an historically specific experience. Fredric Jameson’s analysis of the novels of Balzac and Conrad is exemplary in this respect. Jameson identifies in the narrative narrative<br>

  Book Title: Early Cinema and the "National"-  Publisher: John Libbey Publishing<br>
  Author(s): King Rob<br>
  Abstract: While many studies have been written on national cinemas, Early Cinema and the "National" is the first anthology to focus on the concept of national film culture from a wide methodological spectrum of interests, including not only visual and narrative forms, but also international geopolitics, exhibition and marketing practices, and pressing linkages to national imageries. The essays in this richly illustrated, landmark anthology are devoted to reconsidering the nation as a framing category for writing cinema history. Many of the 34 contributors show that concepts of a national identity played a role in establishing the parameters of cinema's early development, from technological change to discourses of stardom, from emerging genres to intertitling practices. Yet, as others attest, national meanings could often become knotty in other contexts, when concepts of nationhood were contested in relation to colonial/imperial histories and regional configurations. Early Cinema and the "National" takes stock of a formative moment in cinema history, tracing the beginnings of the process whereby nations learned to imagine themselves through moving images.<br>

  Abstract: In this essay, I wish to introduce the notion of “national film culture”, trace the process of the emergence of nationally specific film cultures in Europe, and offer an explanation for that emergence, which I hope will be fruitful for the USA and other countries as well.¹ Germany will be my main case study because it has been the focus of my empirical research on early cinema. Through the notion of national film culture I wish to avoid the usual ideological and essentializing connotations implicated in the term “nation”.

To his list of “thingified” concepts I would add the local or thecommunitywhich have been, and continue to be, reified within anthropological discourse and practice. The boundaries of the local or the community—however broadly they may be defined or imagined—are often taken as a given, and hence naturalized.

  Book Title: Recollections of France-Memories, Identities and Heritage in Contemporary France<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Picard Jeanine<br>
  Abstract: Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

  Author(s) Jenkins Brian<br>
  Abstract: For a long time the writing of French history was profoundly influenced by what are now referred to as ‘grand narratives’, which structured our perceptions of the national past. The concern to tell a convincing and coherent story, to make history intelligible and relevant to the present, led historians from a variety of schools and disciplines to focus on the

  Author(s) Baumann Gerd<br>
  Abstract: There is consensus among historians and social scientists that collective identities can undergo thorough and sometimes radical processes of redefinition. Such changes of self-definition have been observed most clearly among populations that have located themselves in new historical contexts by long-distance migration and diasporic settlement. So much is clear, yet this consensus raises a tricky theoretical question. How is it possible that the same social agents can reaffirm putatively ancient ethnic or cultural cleavages in some situations, but can construct new identities and alternative or hybrid cultural forms in others? The answer I shall propose understands cultural identities as discursive<br>

  Author(s) Kapferer Bruce<br>
  Abstract: The cosmologies implicated in sorcery practice are human-centric. Within them, human beings are at the heart of processes that are integral in the formation of their psychical, social and political universes. Sorcery fetishises human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances. The fabulous character of so much sorcery practice, its transgressive and unbounded dimensions, a rich symbolism that appears to press towards and beyond the limits of the human imagination, is surely connected to the overpowering and totalising impetus that sorcery recognises in human agency and capacities.<br>

  Abstract: The long and complicated process of social, economic, and political transformation of central and eastern Europe, which began in 1989, is still far from complete and needs much more research to be fully understood in its many aspects. The decomposition, construction, and reconstruction of collective identities constitute one of the dimensions of this transformation that has been widely debated, but which still causes controversy and must be better understood. Contemporary central and eastern Europe is thus a very productive place to study – a social laboratory ideal for researchers interested in social change.<br>

  Abstract: Residential segregation and white dominance are integrally related. White choices are not only the aggregation of individual preferences regarding proximity to blacks.

  Abstract: Five-month-old infants who stare at surprising events for a long time, 5-year-old children with large vocabularies, and 50-year-old adults who invent new computer programs are all described as intelligent. The use of the same adjective implies that the same process is operating in all three situations. But we have no good evidence to support the idea that the psychological processes that produce an attentive infant are the same as those that produce a creative computer programmer. Moreover, a small number of psychologists—including J. P. Guilford, Howard Gardner, and Robert Sternberg—have argued persuasively against the usefulness of the notion<br>

  Abstract: White supremacy holds that the interests of people of European descent are superior to those of people who believe, act, or look differently than” normal.” It perpetuates the stratification of class, race, religion, sexual orientation, and gender. It embraces Nazism, fascism, and violence. Its open manifestations are extremist hate groups; its results are political and social systems based not on the democratic ideals of majority rule, tolerance, diversity, equality, and justice, but on “white is right.” White supremacists are America’s deepest nightmare because they attack not only individuals and groups, but the legitimacy of our democratic process itself.<br>

  Abstract: Until the end of the 1960s, the sociology of religion was governed by one principal objective: namely, that of illuminating and analyzing the structural connection between the rise of modernity and the cultural and social repression of religion. The readings of the founding fathers of the discipline, dominant up to that time, furnished the theoretical underpinnings for this program: Marx, Durkheim, and Weber have certainly developed radically different approaches to the structures and functions of society, but each has, in his own way, contributed to establishing that the process of rationalization characterizing the advance of modernity is identical to the<br>

  Author(s) Kate Laurens ten<br>
  Abstract: In the previous part of this book, the deconstruction of Christianity has been presented as an analysis of the complex relation between modern culture and religion. As Nancy carries it out, this analysis is not simply a form of “deconstructive activity”—deconstruction as a means to investigate an object—but an examination of Christianity’s self-deconstruction. The interplay between religion and modernity brings to the fore a dynamic of self-deconstruction, in which both are involved in a constant process of “turning away from themselves” and “leaving themselves behind.” This retreat from self, Nancy suggests, may be a movement that is as<br>

  Literary Creation, Creation ex Nihilo from:

  Author(s) McKeane John<br>
  Abstract: In
                  Dis-enclosure, Jean-Luc Nancy suggests that in Western culture “God’s act of creation” has provided “the least bad analogical recourse” for designating the “void-artist-body [corps-vide-artiste]” (D69/99; first trans. modified). Working backward, from this we can posit, still speaking analogically, that God’s act of creation generated the myth or concept of creation that is involved in the process and results of literary writing. Such a myth of creation should be understood in at least two senses: first, myth as an originary tale (récit) of foundation that has come down to us via the Judeo-Christian tradition (Genesis), and second, myth in<br>

  Author(s) O’BYRNE ANNE<br>
  Abstract: Jean-Luc Nancy is without doubt a post-Marxist, post-Heideggerian and—I would add—post-Arendtian thinker.¹ His ontology bears traces of all three, but this ontology flows, above all, from an attempt to think creation ex nihilo after the death of the creator God. Even now, so long after Nietzsche, and so very long after Descartes set the process of secularization in motion, it is a thinking that is only uneasily, hesitantly under way. We have gone beyond God, as Nancy puts it, but in a direction still too much determined by the thought of his death and by the necro-monotheist tradition<br>

  Author(s) Alexandrova Alena<br>
  Abstract: Whereas Part III deals with how the self-deconstruction of monotheism and Christianity entails a poetic mode of language and sense, this part examines how this self-deconstructive moment plays out in art and the image. Nancy suggests that art does not merely illustrate religion. Instead, the two are involved in the same self-deconstructive movement or in a process of a mutual dis-enclosure. Whereas art provides the sensible articulation of the internal destabilization of the religious mode, the unstable core in religion—an origin in its displacement—forms an integral part of the condition of art.<br>

  Abstract: To describe biblical performance criticism, I start by explaining how human beings communicate. Performance criticism analyzes and practices certain kinds of communication, specifically repeated behaviors for an audience. Inquiry, imagination, and intervention are three aspects of a performance and its analysis. Biblical performance criticism is the analysis and practice of performances of biblical traditions. The basic method of biblical performance criticism is to prepare, internalize, and perform a biblical text. Although it may make it sound like a step-by-step process, performance criticism is really more circular and interrelated, like nodes on a network that influence each other rather than a<br>

  Abstract: In
      Freud's

Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

Ideally, some distinct idea might cut across this array of subjects and unite them along a continuum, much as the principles of liberal democracy unite diverse elements of the body politic.

Yet paradigmatic revolution—a profound change in consciousness, however foolish that idea seems—is in the wind, and humankind may be on the brink of a postmodern age. Of course such qualifiers as anti-or posttend to obscure the central issue: Modernism.¹ Crucially, the idea of wilderness appears to undergird a new paradigm for understanding humankind as embodying natural process grown self-conscious.

  Book Title: Land and People-Papers in Memory of John G. Evans<br>
  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): O’Connor Terry<br>
  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

  [Part 3 Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cfr8z1">Land and People</a><br>
  Abstract: The study of coasts and islands provides many opportunities. Many sites, now on our coast, may be presevered and protected by depositional processes enveloping them in sequences of blown sand, facilitating both exceptional preservation, and potentially great stratigraphic separation of sequences of activity such as at Gwithian, Brean Down, Nornour and Northton for instance. In many cases their costal position today may belie their location in prehistory. Conversely, others may be exposed by coastal erosion making them available for research for a short window of time before they are ultimately lost to us. Islands allow us to examine island communities<br>

  4  Revising Yoderʹs Theological Method from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4k49">Principalities and Powers</a><br>
  Abstract: The powers’ dynamic autonomization never escapes the grip of providence. The fallen powers are created powers. As neither wholly good, nor wholly evil, the shape of the powers must be discerned. Yoder’s theological method privileges a form of discernment rooted in the practical encounter between specific Christian communities and specific powers. Discernment is ultimately a function of mission. Theologians’ contribution to this mission is limited, according to Yoder, yet indispensable for the discernment process. The theologian’s gifts of linguistic analysis and scriptural and historical memory are useful because they facilitate a comparison of the powers with the way of Jesus.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4kgg">In the Fellowship of His Suffering</a><br>
  Abstract: In this study we observed that the experiences of those suffering from mental illness call into question our collective Western understanding of these phenomena. Historically, how the experiences are named determined the types of treatment that were deemed to be appropriate. The church has participated in this process, but laterally, the naming, framing and responding to those experiences have become the terrain of psychiatry. Psychiatry has a questionable history and has been the location for various political, economic, and professional power struggles as the discipline has developed and has sought to offer a rationale for its existence.<br>

  Abstract: Developments in the twenty-first century are altering perceptions of Christianity and the relationship of Christianity to culture around the world. Churches in Asia, Africa, and Latin America now have an opportunity to challenge the Western-American monopolization of Christianity. While local expressions of Christianity might in some ways hinder global fellowship, I believe now is an ideal time for churches around the world to share resources and experiences and to develop strong local cultural identities as well as strong global bonds. The churches in China have begun this process of local indigenization and have also initiated global networking. This chapter will<br>

  Book Title: Dealing with Dictators-The United States, Hungary, and East Central Europe, 1942-1989<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): VINCZ JASON<br>
  Abstract: Dealing with Dictators explores America's Cold War efforts to make the dictatorships of Eastern Europe less tyrannical and more responsive to the country's international interests. During this period, US policies were a mix of economic and psychological warfare, subversion, cultural and economic penetration, and coercive diplomacy. Through careful examination of American and Hungarian sources, László Borhi assesses why some policies toward Hungary achieved their goals while others were not successful. When George H. W. Bush exclaimed to Mikhail Gorbachev on the day the Soviet Union collapsed, "Together we liberated Eastern Europe and unified Germany," he was hardly doing justice to the complicated history of the era. The story of the process by which the transition from Soviet satellite to independent state occurred in Hungary sheds light on the dynamics of systemic change in international politics at the end of the Cold War.<br>

  Abstract: The day the Soviet Union collapsed, George H. W. Bush penned a personal note to his friend Mikhail Gorbachev in which he immodestly declared, “Together we liberated Eastern Europe and unified Germany.”¹ Did this bold claim do justice to the complicated history of the transition from the Cold War to the reunification of Europe, the restoration of multiparty democracy, and national independence in Eastern Europe? The answer to this question is not only a matter of historical truth. The clarification of the process of transition will shed light on the dynamics of systemic change in international politics at the end<br>

  Author(s) HOWELL J. DWAYNE<br>
  Abstract: The Bible, the sermon, and the congregation are all intricately related to the personal. Each is influenced by what is seen and heard and by how events and words are interpreted. The biblical text has a rich historical context in the ancient Near East that aids the reader in understanding what the text meant. However, this history is not a static history, locked in the past. Instead, it is a dynamic history of the divine acts of God that can be seen throughout the canonizing process as successive generations interpreted the tradition and text for their situations.

The first part will set out the theoretical basis for the notion of the text as an active agent in the interpretive process. The second part also focuses on theory and deals with the conceptual structure of the argument, based on a methodical examination of texts, contexts, and cultures. After introducing general theoretical considerations to these three concepts, this chapter will then elucidate their application and relevance to the case of Northern Ireland evangelicalism during the Troubles.

  Abstract: Lilith, first written in 1890, is MacDonald’s last fantastic novel. It is often considered to be his most difficult and disturbing piece of writing. He revised his first draft several times over a period of five years and completed the final version in 1895. The editing process for this novel was intense and long, and Richard Reis argues that of all the manuscripts we have of MacDonald’s works, none shows so much careful re-writing as theLilithmanuscripts.¹ This gives us some indication thatLilithis a well thought out piece of writing with its imagery carefully and purposefully chosen.<br>

  Book Title: Drinking from the Wells of New Creation-The Holy Spirit and the Imagination in Reconciliation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0zj">Groundless Gods</a><br>
  Author(s) WABEL THOMAS<br>
  Abstract: In his categorial semiotics and phenomenology, Charles Sanders Peirce arrives at a fundamental triadic structure that, he claims, shapes all possible experience and reality alike. The subject—seen as the “interpretant” in a triadic semiotic process—becomes an instance in the self-interpretation of the universe of signs. Thus, perception of reality and reality itself coincide. This can be experienced in what Peirce calls the category of “Firstness.” Following Peirce, the contemplation of reality in the immediate experience of its quality (Firstness) is a phenomenological task. In Peirce’s “humble argument” for the reality of God, the experience of Firstness can account<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf112">Contextual Theology for the Twenty-First Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Álvarez Carmelo E.<br>
  Abstract: The title of my presentation is an invitation to explore the contributions of liberation theology in Latin America and the Caribbean and the challenges it poses to the twenty-first century. I come as a witness that takes seriously the context in which this theology was developed. As the late Taiwanese theologian Shoki Coe, Director of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches in the 1970s, used to stress, contextualizing theology as an ongoing process becomes a key hermeneutical principle both in educating for the ministry and promoting a relevant theology.¹<br>

  Abstract: In Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor’s massive and highly regarded work, he has examined the impact of a long and continuing process of secularization on our views of religion in society.¹ In the societies of the Western world we commonly see secularization as implicated in the development of our post-Christendom age and the emergence of post-Christian society. Post-Christendom and post-Christian are not terms that Taylor employs. However, he sees one expression of secularity to be the public sphere “emptied of God or any reference to ultimate reality” and the norms of our various spheres of activity devoid of any reference to<br>

  Book Title: Translating the English Bible-From Relevance to Deconstruction<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf65j">Biblical Knowing</a><br>
  Abstract: So far, we have attempted to show that the canon is concerned to portray an epistemological process at the very outset of humanity’s history. What does the Tanakh then do with this view of knowing throughout its texts? Stated otherwise, is the epistemological process of Genesis 2–3 unique or normative? We contend below that Scripture recounts Israel’s errors in terms of Genesis 2–3, where knowing is contingent upon which authority is being heeded, and then whether or not the knower participates in the prescribed route to knowledge (e.g., not eating the fruit of prohibition). Proper knowing happens when<br>

Submission and praxis are not novel concepts in the history of Judaism or Christianity (or any religion for that matter). However, the idea that accredited authorities, process, and embodied participation form the centerpiece of all proper knowing is a more radical proposition.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf65j">Biblical Knowing</a><br>
  Abstract: In the next two chapters, we will take a dramatic turn toward recent scholarship in epistemology. We have examined both the historical books of the Tanakh and the Gospel accounts in which an epistemological process is present, relevant, and persistent. Early on, we made the claim that this view should not be reduced to a religious epistemology, but that it covers knowing writ large. In this chapter, we want to argue that there is an extant view of scientific epistemology that provides us with an overlapping model of what we see in the Christian Scriptures.

But, in an effort to show the practical matters that have to do with the lives of theologians, philosophers, teachers, pastors, and more, we will briefly consider some reflections and paint pictures of what knowing looks like as a real life process. Further, we will describe some reverberations from thinking about the church’s normal activities as epistemological processes, seeking to enliven our wisdom together in the church.<br>

  Abstract: Lament and penitential prayer are closely related. Both are responses to suffering and crisis yet the ways in which they address God and the assumptions they make about the relationship and the allocation of responsibility are quite different. In the light of recent research on penitential prayer I want to re-examine aspects of the relationship between such prayers and the laments. In the process I want to look again at the implications for theology and Christian practice that were highlighted in seminal work by Claus Westermann and Walter Brueggemann.¹<br>

  Abstract: When Wesley spoke of “the whole process of a man reasoning, groaning, striving, and escaping from the legal to the evangelical state,”¹ he was bearing witness that there is “a definite teleology to divine grace.”² The centerpiece of this testimony was that the revelation of Christ was (and is) the salvation-historical event that demarcates the legal from the evangelical (gospel, Christian) dispensation of the covenant of grace. This was more than a theological affirmation, for even as the revelation of Christ in the course of the history of God’s saving deeds ushered all of humanity into the Christian dispensation (historically<br>

My underlying assumption is that the understanding of the past generated by such a process plays an essential role in shaping attitudes and actions of individuals and societies in the present. This understanding (“memory”) is at times difficult to distinguish from the process of its formation (“memorialization”); the former is often the<br>

  Abstract: The third symbol presented by Juergensmeyer and others for understanding the link between violence and religion is the phenomenon of demonization. In this chapter, I will argue that without a heuristic account of evil, people will be unable to discern why demonization continues the cycle of violence. We will see that social exclusion and humiliation provide for the emergence and survival of demonizing processes, while acts of dehumanization escalate those processes to the point where those demonized are robbed of their subjectivity. Emerging out of situations where there is an imbalance of power, I will demonstrate the role of

Tracing the economic movement of Christian theology and mission, a critical study was undertaken in regard to Christian mission and colonialism in the New World and also Weber’s thesis of the Protestant ethic and capitalist spirit. Along with the capitalist development of world-economy and sociological analysis of religious ideas, it is necessary to examine how closely the philosophical ideas of individual rights, civil society, and freedom have been intertwined with the economic individualism of capitalism.<br>

  Book Title: The Helping Relationship-Healing and Change in Community Context<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rovers Martin<br>
  Abstract: The increased use of and emphasis on managed care, manualized treatment protocols, evidence-based treatments and quick treatments have marginalized the role of the helping relationship in the helping professions. This shift has sparked a debate within the helping professions over whether the helping relationship or technique is primarily responsible for healing and change.
      The Helping Relationshipweighs in on this debate, arguing that healing and change always take place within the context of relationships and that the relationship is more important than the technique. While recognizing the value of techniques, the authors valorize the helping relationship, considering it in unconventional contexts, such as formal education, supervision, and faith communities to show its flexibility and efficacy. This alternative approach adds a new perspective on the helping relationship debate, shedding new light on the roles of relationship and technique in the healing process.<br>

  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Moser Walter<br>
  Abstract: Cet ouvrage vise à éclairer deux problématiques actuelles, l'intermédialité - l'interaction des représentations médiatiques - et l'interculturalité - l'interaction des cultures. Trois questions principales guident les contributeurs au volume : Comment les médias se sont-ils inscrits dans le processus actuel de mondialisation culturelle ? Quelles sont les images d'autres cultures qu'ils construisent ? Dans quelle mesure les médias exercent-t-ils une violence par rapport à d'autres cultures qui n'ont pas l'habitude de se représenter dans les genres médiatiques de l'Occident ? Pour y répondre, les auteurs explorent le rôle des médias dans la connaissance de l'Autre, la violence interculturelle et la mondialisation. Ils découvrent que le fil conducteur réside dans la tension entre mondialisation et réappropriation, entre images stéréotypées et images complexes, entre violence médiatique et formes de résistance.<br>

That aspect of the liberal tradition generates an approach to constitutional law that John Hart Ely calls “representation reinforcing review.” If policy is to be based on the aggregation of preferences, there is a strong prima facie case that policy should be made through voting. The voting process asks people to express their preferences; policies based on those revealed preferences emerge<br>

  4  Antiformalism in Constitutional Theory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ch7988">Red, White, and Blue</a><br>
  Abstract: The preceding chapters have examined a number of efforts to explain why a small group of people, called judges, should be allowed to displace the otherwise legally authoritative decisions of a somewhat larger group of people, called legislators, who are selected by processes that seem closer to the normatively attractive mechanisms of democracy than those used to select judges.¹ These efforts attempt to provide “formalist” solutions to the countermajoritarian difficulty with which the liberal tradition is concerned. This chapter examines antiformalist attempts to displace concern with the countermajoritarian difficulty rather than to allay that concern. It argues that these antiformalist<br>

  Abstract: Today’s prevalent political theories describe the task of social institutions, such as the market and the political process, as aggregating the preferences of society’s members. (See, for instance, Chapter 2.) Social institutions themselves, however, influence the preferences that they are then supposed to aggregate.¹ It is difficult to understand how the aggregation can coherently take place when preferences are not exogenous to the institutions.<br>

  Abstract: Both of these epigraphs serve as a rough itinerary of this essay’s conceptual inquiries and multi-generic reading practices. Through their different political perspectives, the two quotations raise questions about, first, indigenous accounts of what Zygmunt Bauman calls the “human” and “social consequences of the globalizing process” (1), and, second, the theoretical and pedagogical value of diverse concepts and metaphors of cultural hybridity in an indigenous context. But they are also a reminder that “epigraph[s],” in Jacques Derrida’s words, “will never make a beginning” but comprise an indefinite network of texts (

  Abstract: Technological changes have had a dramatic impact upon the financing, organization and delivery of health care services in Canada. Professionals and health care decision makers now wrestle with increasingly complex sets of challenges that must involve various types of professionals in programs of care. The result is that administrators, nurses, physicians, social workers and other professionals have had diverse roles to play in programs of care and, consequently, have insisted that their voices be heard in the decision-making process alongside the voices of patients and their families. Needless to say, the ensuing discussions have become difficult because the diverse professional<br>

  Abstract: Why is it that the British colonial language of inclusion (paternalistic and morally degrading though it was) was at such variance with colonial practice? The answer may lie in the British assertion of cultural purity that sought to create the colonial human being and Acadia itself, and that, paradoxically, constituted the foundation of calls for the civilization of aboriginal peoples. The claim to be firmly British was clearly problematic. These peoples’ European identity had been transformed in the process of becoming colonials. Western Europeans, for instance, were not scalpers; the British in eighteenth century Acadia were. After announcing in 1749<br>

  Abstract: When the novelist experiments with narrative techniques the reader, necessarily, becomes actively engaged in the process of discerning patterns and perceiving meanings. Within the context of reader response theory this paper explores the narrative layering in the novels of Timothy Findley and the structuring of texts that consciously anticipate the role of the reader. Implicit in this reading of Findley’s work is a tripartite model of reader response theory that includes a self-consciously constructing writer, a self-referentially deconstructing reader, and the enigmatic text of their mutual exchange. While the theory of the reader’s response has tended to be based on<br>

  Book Title: Comparing Faithfully-Insights for Systematic Theological Reflection<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: Every generation of theologians must respond to its context by rearticulating the central tenets of the faith. Interreligious comparison has been integral to this process from the start of the Christian tradition and is especially salient today. The emerging field of comparative theology, in which close study of another religious tradition yields new questions and categories for theological reflection in the scholar's home tradition, embodies the ecumenical spirit of this moment. This discipline has the potential to enrich systematic theology and, by extension, theological education, at its foundations. This resource for pastors and theology students reconsiders five central doctrines of the Christian faith in light of focused interreligious investigations. The dialogical format of the book builds conversation about the doctrine of God, theodicy, humanity, Christology, and soteriology. Its comparative essays span examples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Jain, and Confucian traditions, indigenous Aztec theology, and contemporary "spiritual but not religious" thought, to offer exciting new perspectives on Christian doctrine. The essays in this volume demonstrate that engagement with religious diversity need not be an afterthought in the study of Christian systematic theology; rather, it can be a way into systematic theological thinking. Each section invites students to test theological categories, to consider Christian doctrine in relation to specific comparisons, and to take up comparative study in their own contexts.<br>

The multiplicity of Christological titles in the New Testament—Messiah, Lord, savior, prophet, high priest, Son of God, and so on—all qualify each other and become reinterpreted in light of the Christ event. Together they express the centrality and sui generis nature—in short, the uniqueness—of Jesus for Christian faith.

  Book Title: Ethos and Narrative Interpretation-The Negotiation of Values in Fiction<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Herman David<br>
  Abstract: Ethos and Narrative Interpretationexamines the fruitfulness of the concept of ethos for the theory and analysis of literary narrative. The notion of ethos refers to the broadly persuasive effects of the image one may have of a speaker's psychology, world view, and emotional or ethical stance. How and why do readers attribute an ethos (of, for example, sincerity, reliability, authority, or irony) to literary characters, narrators, and even to authors? Are there particular conditions under which it is more appropriate for interpreters to attribute an ethos to authors, rather than to narrators? In the answer Liesbeth Korthals Altes proposes to such questions, ethos attributions are deeply implicated in the process of interpreting and evaluating narrative texts.<br>

  Abstract: The question of how and why readers would attribute an ethos to literary characters, narrators, or authors is part of the more general issue of how people make meaning from and with texts. Within the humanities, such issues are traditionally the province of hermeneutics, which encompasses the theory, the method (or the “art”), and the practice of interpreting texts. Alternately, interpretations and their underlying processes are studied from the perspective of literary and aesthetic phenomenology, the sociology of literature, discourse analysis, the reception history of literary works (

Trends and processes can be explained, in principle, by feedback mechanisms such as self-regulating markets and balances of power. Indeed, simple homeostatic devices such as the fantail, even as they made possible the industrial revolution, served as the first modern models of political economy (Wootton 2007:42). Specific events, however, seem to slip the net of scientific explanation.

For one thing, the translation of European languages does not usually present real physical and spiritual dangers.¹ For another, there are the complexities of collaboration between non-Native academics and Native American culture-bearers, formerly “informants.” Moreover, translators have to decide how to transform oral expression into a written form, and in addition they may have to produce their own grammars and dictionaries, as part of what Julie Brittain and Marguerite MacKenzie in this volume term “a unique constellation of factors.” This constellation can also include “the interaction of<br>

  Abstract: One decision confronting translators of orally performed American Indian verbal art concerns what to do with material that is regarded as questionable by one of the several persons who may figure into the process that begins with oral performance and ends with the publication of a written representation of that performance. The performer, the ethnographer who documents the performance, the translator, an editor, or a publisher may decide that a feature of a story or song should be withheld or transformed, usually to protect someone or something from moral or spiritual contamination. Under ideal conditions, the performer should not feel<br>

  Abstract: Shortly after the British–U.S. border dividing the Great Lakes was established by the 1783 Treaty of Paris, the respective governments began treaty processes with the highly respected and powerful First Nations in the Old Northwest, in an attempt to accommodate the needs of the First Nations in anticipation of an influx of settlers to the regions. Prior to that time, contact with the First Nations in the Great Lakes region was extensive, largely through fur-trading operations and Catholic missions. Priests and traders from Lower Canada and Europe had built close relations with the First Nations. Indeed, many of the<br>

  Book Title: Useful Fictions-Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): AUSTIN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on evolutionary biology, anthropology, narrative theory, cognitive psychology, game theory, and evolutionary aesthetics, Austin develops the concept of a "useful fiction," a simple narrative that serves an adaptive function unrelated to its factual one. In his work we see how these useful fictions play a key role in neutralizing the overwhelming anxiety that humans can experience as their minds gather and process information. Rudimentary narratives constructed for this purpose, Austin suggests, provided a cognitive scaffold that might have become the basis for our well-documented love of fictional stories. Written in clear, jargon-free prose and employing abundant literary examples-from the Bible to
      One Thousand and One Arabian NightsandDon QuixotetoNo Exit-Austin's work offers a new way of understanding the relationship between fiction and evolutionary processes-and, perhaps, the very origins of literature.<br>

  Abstract: Human beings are not fact machines—beings who scan the environment for information and then process it in their extremely large brains to produce pasteurized lumps of truth. Thomas Gradgrind’s vision in Charles Dickens’s
                  Hard Times—a board of fact, composed of commissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact—has never been realized.¹ Through the course of the novel, Gradgrind comes to understand that human beings are not governed by facts and that they cannot be forced into a world of fact without a substantial amount of violence against their very natures.

  Abstract: Following the successful passage of the War Crimes Act amendments, which left little of the 1945 statute intact, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) continued its inquiries. The files that were felt to contain the strongest evidence were sent to a leading Sydney criminal lawyer, Greg James QC, who reviewed the information and evidence and advised the Commonwealth’s director of public prosecutions (DPP) on those cases that in his opinion could be pursued through the courts. The practice that was adopted conformed with the underlying ethos of the prosecution scheme that had informed the Australian war crimes process from its beginnings.<br>

  Abstract: Saul Friedlander has identified the anxieties that have come to characterize debates about the historical construction of events known as the Shoah, the killing of European Jews by the Nazis and their national collaborators in occupied Europe. He writes: “On the one hand, our traditional categories of conceptualization and representation may well be insufficient, our language itself problematic. On the other hand, in the face of these events we feel the need of some stable narration; a boundless field of possible discourse raises the issue of limits with particular stringency.”¹ These concerns about processes, rhetoric, and memory have an impact<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I posit that the selected works by Michèle Lacrosil, Ken Bugul, and Ousmane Sembène complicate Fanon’s formula for colonial violence by offering a specifically female perspective on the experience and legacy of colonialism’s brutality. This chapter discusses these relationships in two different areas. First, I examine the process of epistemological violence — brainwashing through formal and informal education — as a legacy of colonialism. Second, I study the specificity of women’s experience within the colonial discourse. This involves a close analysis of Ken Bugul’s violent encounter with the West and Lacrosil’s depiction of a severe case of<br>

  Author(s): Curtis Sarah A.<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays offers examples drawn from an imperial history of France that show the power of the periphery to shape diverse and dynamic modern French identities at its center. Each essay explains French identity as a fluid process rather than a category into which French citizens (and immigrants) are expected to fit. In using a core/periphery framework to explore identity creation,

We live indeed on the continent supposed to have invented “History” as opposed to “Myth,” the continent that furthermore brought History to America and imposed it upon the Natives through the violence of the Conquest. History and Myth have always collided in myriad directions that have found their way into contemporary literature, and in a particularly forceful way in the writings of many Native North American authors. History can be briefly defined as a narration about the past based on<br>

  Book Title: Public Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: In early imperial China, the dead were remembered by stereotyping them, by relating them to the existing public memory and not by vaunting what made each person individually distinct and extraordinary in his or her lifetime. Their posthumous names were chosen from a limited predetermined pool; their descriptors were derived from set phrases in the classical tradition; and their identities were explicitly categorized as being like this cultural hero or that sage official in antiquity. In other words, postmortem remembrance was a process of pouring new ancestors into prefabricated molds or stamping them with rigid cookie cutters. Public Memory in Early China is an examination of this pouring and stamping process. After surveying ways in which learning in the early imperial period relied upon memorization and recitation, K. E. Brashier treats three definitive parameters of identity—name, age, and kinship—as ways of negotiating a person’s relative position within the collective consciousness. He then examines both the tangible and intangible media responsible for keeping that defined identity welded into the infrastructure of Han public memory.<br>

Not only are these processes similar, they are symbiotic, since a personality “shapes itself, both internally and externally, by means of images, many of which have<br>

  Book Title: Forms of Life-Character and Moral Imagination in the Novel<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PRICE MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

  Abstract: Depuis les travaux de Schumpeter, le concept d’innovation s’est principalement concentré sur les évolutions économiques et techniques tandis que les sciences sociales se sont particulièrement intéressées aux processus et aux effets sociaux correspondants (Harrisson, 2012).

  Author(s) Kennedy George A.<br>
  Abstract: My title, “Reworking Aristotle’s
                  Rhetoric,” has several possible meanings. For one thing, all of us who study rhetoric are in some sense engaged in our own reworking, interpretation, and application of it. More specifically, I have recently worked through theRhetoricagain in the process of making a new translation of it, with introduction and notes. I would like to discuss some of the things I have noticed, but will only comment occasionally on my own translation. Finally, I will say something about the strengths and weaknesses of theRhetoricand how it, as a general rhetoric, may need to<br>

  Chapter 6  THE PRINCIPLE OF DIFFERENTIATION IN JAPANESE SOCIETY AND INTERNATIONAL KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER BETWEEN BOURDIEU AND JAPAN from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ffjq3f">The Anthem Companion to Pierre Bourdieu</a><br>
  Author(s) Iso Naoki<br>
  Abstract: In this essay, we examine the history of the Japanese reception of Pierre Bourdieu’s works generally, and his essays on Japan specifically, from the viewpoints of the principle of differentiation and the concept of capital, both regarding international knowledge transfer (Robbins 2012).¹ The Japanese modernization and industrialization processes are always embedded within a unique knowledge transfer process. Japanese modernization processes, especially during the Meiji era, are often identified as
                  Wakon Yōsai(和魂洋才), which means ‘Japanese spirit, Western technology’ (Hirakawa 1971, 2004; Chew 2014). Japanese modernization processes often emphasized the maximization of utility and function in a Japanese spirit influenced by<br>

  Abstract: Crafting a literary work does not happen in isolation. Imitation and creative adaptation of extant models are regular parts of the creative process. Imitation and adaptation result in the formation of literary “genres” or types that conform to certain patterns, generating expectations on the part of readers.¹ Genres are thus inevitable wherever literature is created.² In some contexts, generic patterns may be more formally recognized and described by theorists, but genres are operating whether formally recognized or not.<br>

  Abstract: Narratives need time to tell their stories. In fact, without time, a narrative is not a narrative. This is because in order to tell a story, the storyteller must relay to the hearer or reader at least one process or event. For example, “Everett” is not a narrative. “Everett walks” is not much of a narrative, though the present tense “walks” in English implies a motion that occurs in time. A better narrative would be, “Everett drove the car to the store, picked up groceries, and came home.” This is the beginning of a “real” narrative because it entails multiple<br>

  Abstract: One of the most amazing objects in any European museum is a painted clay statue on display in Nicosia which shows a woman with a baby emerging upside down from her vagina. It is probably the only representation in all of European prehistory which shows a woman actually giving birth — a mind-boggling fact when one considers, as Mark Twain remarked, that being born is one of the few universal human experiences. And this thought-provoking find is not alone. From the golden face masks of Mycenae to the unparalleled youths and processing women in the Akrotiri frescoes — so unlike anything in<br>

  Author(s) Christakis Kostis<br>
  Abstract: The application of marks on pottery during the manufacture and before the firing of a pot is a widespread practice in both the archaeological and ethnographic records of a range of different cultural milieus. Given that the mark was applied before the firing process, it is generally agreed that it is the potter who was responsible for marking the pot. Discussions so far have focused exclusively on the function and meaning of these marks. Most scholars relate them to potters and/or workshops (

  Author(s) Galanakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: Although mortuary data is one of the primary sources for studying the Late Bronze Age (LBA) in the Aegean, it is often studied in isolation from the complex, multi-staged processes and performances that made up the funeral and everything that followed it. The depositional sequence of these actions is most frequently overlooked, not least because of practical difficulties in reconstructing these events and the ephemeral and often ambiguous nature of the evidence. Despite these limitations, however, there are many clues, both direct — in the form of residual remains — and indirect — in the form of purposefully destroyed things¹ — that hint at<br>

  Author(s) Papadimitriou Nikolas<br>
  Abstract: The present paper aims at investigating — both theoretically and in the context of the Early Mycenaean period in mainland Greece (Table 26.1) — the relation of funerary rituals with processes of shaping, negotiating and transmitting collective identities. In particular, I wish to explore the role of specially designated ritual spaces (in this case, the
                  dromoiof Mycenaean tombs) as frameworks for the creation of embodied experiences of shared remembering and identification. In this effort, I will draw extensively on anthropological literature examining rituals as public performances. Anthropologists recognise widely the ability of rituals to instil social values, worldviews and power relations<br>

  Book Title: Assia Djebar-Out of Algeria<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: For more than fifty years, Assia Djebar, former Silver Chair of French at New York University and winner of the Neustadt Prize for Contribution to World Literature, used the tools of poetry, fiction, drama and film to vividly portray the world of Muslim women in all its complexity. In the process, she became one of the most important figures in North African literature. In
      Assia Djebar, Jane Hiddleston traces Djebar's development as a writer against the backdrop of North Africa's tumultuous history. Whereas Djebar's early writings were largely an attempt to delineate clearly the experience of being a woman, an intellectual, and an Algerian embedded in that often violent history, she had in her more recent work evinced a growing sense that the influence of French culture on Algerian letters may make such a project impossible. The first book-length study of this significant writer,Assia Djebarwill be of tremendous interest to anyone studying post-colonial literature, women's studies or Francophone culture in general.<br>

  Abstract: The most recent phase of Djebar’s work, including

This chapter focuses on the feelings of strangeness that underlie readers’ engagements with characters by using as case studies two novels, Haruki Murakami’s

  Abstract: In

As a result, these copies are clearly distinct from the work of art, whose uniqueness is what Benjamin calls “aura”.

  Abstract: In the light of a heightened sense of contingency and vulnerability, a pronounced uncertainty has set in since the late twentieth century about human nature and, hence, the image of the human being. This has been fuelled further by the recognition of the inherent ambiguity of these concepts. Awareness of the precariousness of our assumptions about what human beings are like has not only affected intellectuals, prompting philosophers and social scientists to embark on a searching interrogation, but has also penetrated into the policymaking and the public domain. While philosophers and social scientists may still be able, during the process<br>

  Abstract: All scientific work starts with some simplification of basic concepts. Once these have been defined and established, we begin to pile up empirical variations. During this process, the simplifying notions are modified and, eventually, they may disappear. For example, economics assumes scarcity, and hence the need to rationalize and economize; politics presupposes the existence of struggles to maximize power; and sociology insists upon the necessity of social solidarity. Taking our cue from the etymology of socius , sociology is the science of companionship or friendship. For social science as a whole, civil society is the space in which these somewhat<br>

  Abstract: In 1987, a theoretical book that had been co-written by the sociologist Luc Boltanski and the economist and statistician Laurent Thévenot appeared in an obscure, poorly distributed collection of the Presses Universitaires de France. At first sight, its title may have sounded rather strange:
                  Les économies de la grandeur (Economies of Worth). What was even more disconcerting, however, was the apparent disproportion between the ordinariness of the main issues in question (that is, disputing processes in the workplace, the family, the neighbourhood, etc.) and the ambitious nature of the theoretical framework. In fact, the authors put forward a whole set<br>

  Abstract: If Luc Boltanski’s

It is rather because of the simple fact that it restores a broken link: that between abortion and what it has just denied. A sociology of abortion depends on a sociology of procreation. More exactly, it means understanding abortion as a certain position in the problem opened up by procreation, as twofold natural and social processes: production of the living by the living, reproduction in the biological sense,<br>

  Book Title: Light and Death-Figuration in Spenser, Kepler, Donne, Milton<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

Incorporation, however, is never mechanically anterior to the corporate form, per se, but instead its very essence: a dynamic, precarious activity characterized by a desire for what Kyd called “perpetual succession,” an existence projected aggressively onto a temporal horizon limited only by the criterion of profit (Kyd 1793, 6).

But in the field of psychology, the term has a more turbulent history. Often thought in a tandem with kinesthetics, innervation can be found in early psychological studies of the articular, tendinous, and muscular complexes (Baldwin 1960, 549). Since its inception, innervation has generally been regarded as a mode of energy transfer or conversion—and therefore a process of stimulation, in stark distinction to its current neurophysiological definition<br>

Respiration, reproduction, digestion, blood circulation, and waste removal are functions of these metabolic processes. One driver of metabolism is the endocrine system, which regulates the flow of hormones through the body. Hormones act as a complex exchange of messages among different states and locations. The thyroid gland secretes instructions that increase the rate at which cells utilize energy from food. Human reproduction is similarly governed by sensitivity to chemical messengers like estrogen and testosterone. But the conventional energy sources that power economies and give rise to myriad<br>

In 1824, Joseph Nicéphore Niépce placed lithographic stones coated with bitumen at the back of a camera obscura and produced a fixed image of a landscape. Heliography, the name for this method, emphasizes long exposure to natural light, although the process also consumes fossil fuels. In his 1844

  Abstract: The Bluegrass Pipeline would connect FRACKING operations in the northeast United States with chemical processing plants in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are hydrocarbons like ethane, propane, and butane that are removed from natural gas and used for a variety of purposes, often as petrochemical feedstock.

  Abstract: Every day we dress in oil. At each stage in the process of making, purchasing, and discarding clothing and other textiles, oil is present as a secret companion. Petrochemicals douse the cotton fields; oil powers the complex farm machinery that has replaced hand labor in the fields; it powers the vast looms that weave cotton into fabric. Oil polymers subtend the many synthetic and natural-synthetic hybrid fabrics that make possible a waterproof, stainresistant, hard-wearing, easily replaced material existence. Underlying the vast transport systems that carry textiles and apparel across the globe is oil. At the end of their lives, as<br>

  Abstract: Labor is the greatest reality of human life in this world, it is a primary reality.… In labor there is both a truth of redemption (“in the sweat of your face shall you gain your bread”) and a truth of the creative and constructive power of men. Both elements are present in labor. Human labor humanizes nature; it bears witness to the great mission of man in nature. But sin and evil have perverted the mission of labor.

  Abstract: Emblematic of a dark period in a troubled colonization, the workhouse is a dirty word in Irish history. Its system, buildings, and sites comprise a challenging representational struggle between erasure and reconstruction in remembrance. Workhouses took years to build, employed thousands in the building process, subsequently housed hundreds of thousands from 1840s onward and yet remain a quiet aspect of Famine memory in visual and material culture.¹ The absence of extensively conserved workhouses is a consequence of life going on after the Famine, as some sites became utilized for different purposes and others succumbed to politically motivated destruction.² Workhouses have<br>

  Abstract: The past is always present in Northern Ireland, structuring everyday experience to a degree not generally found elsewhere. In a society where historical events are continually relevant to contemporary life, both cultural memory and processes of memorialization become significant means whereby people live out their identities. In turn, this level of awareness also informs aspects of the visual: artists are not separate from the culture they inhabit but are equally formed by its shared experiences of community, danger, and loss. Much of the work of artists in post-conflict Northern Ireland bears the marks of this communality of experience, whether through<br>

Subsequently, “inculturation” was appropriated by mission theologians to refer to the evangelization of culture, the process by which the Gospel illuminates and transforms culture, while culture reexpresses and even—to a certain extent—reinterprets the Gospel. Joseph Masson, SJ, first used the term in this way in 1962, but it came into current usage in the 1970s, after the earlier terms “adaptation” and “incarnation” were deemed missiologically unsatisfactory.

  Abstract: Most studies concerning the evolution of Catholicism in Western Europe underscore in general the clear decrease in church practices and, sometimes also, the decline or even the erosion of the orthodox beliefs. However, the loss of the impact of Catholicism on these societies manifests itself also in the changes in certain laws in the domain of ethics, which until very recently, were profoundly marked by the Christian vision. This indicates the diminishing ascendancy of Catholicism over our societies, an ‘exculturation’ that testifies to a further step in the secularization process.¹ Indeed, in the last quarter of the 20 th and<br>

  Abstract: THE UNDERLYING working hypothesis of all cognitive approaches to narrative, as I understand it, is that narrative is natural, in the sense that it arises spontaneously among all human groups, across eras and cultures, and that wherever and whenever it occurs it displays similar features. Its ubiquity and longevity are explained by the fact that it reflects fundamental categories and processes of human cognition and experience. The baseline form of all narrative is spontaneously occurring conversational narratives of personal experience, and according to the “natural narrative” hypothesis, the cognitive parameters of natural conversational narrative remain in force even in the<br>

London was in the process of unprecedentedly rapid growth in the nineteenth century, and this rapid growth entailed many painful social adjustments.

  Abstract: The archetypalist position is a very familiar one in literary studies, where it has sanctioned a long history of interpretation as the art of translating symbols into universal archetypes. From this we learn, according to Jung, that the creative process “consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.”³ Jung is clearly the most influential figure in<br>

The processes of substitution implied in language make civilized life possible, but at the cost of our alienation from the primary “knowledge” of ourselves hidden in the unconscious.¹ Language is itself part of a series of absences through which the unconscious leaves its mark.

  Book Title: Tempo e racconto nei processi creativi Strategie narrative per l’architettura-  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Amati Massimiliano<br>
  Abstract: Questo lavoro è un’esplorazione teorica delle strategie che mettono in relazione il tempo e lo spazio nel procedere narrativo delle opere. La ricerca mira a costruire dei ponti tra teoria e pratica del progetto architettonico parafrasando in termini spaziali le teorie più significative costruite intorno al significato di tempo e narrazione. In quest’ottica l’apparato iconografico asseconda la struttura concettuale del testo, che si basa essenzialmente sulle teorie della formatività di Pareyson e sulle teorie del tempo di Ricoeur e Focillon, visualizzate in progetti di arte e architettura. Oggi più che mai, in una realtà che si trasforma velocemente, si afferma l’utilità di un’indagine sul significato evolutivo dei luoghi e dei territori analizzando i processi creativi che legano l’attività umana alla modificazione dello spazio naturale e artificiale. Pensare l’architettura come un’attività che si completa nel tempo ci consente di modulare consapevolmente i processi di cambiamento. In tal senso l’architetto assume il ruolo di un regista o di uno scrittore che inserisce nuovi episodi spaziali in un vecchio testo ereditato, ossia il contesto del progetto. Il suo obiettivo diventa così quello di rileggere le potenzialità latenti del sito per proiettarle nel futuro di una nuova storia.<br>

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

  Book Title: Simplexity-Simplifying Principles for a Complex World'<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Giselle<br>
  Abstract: In a sense, the history of living organisms may be summed up by their remarkable ability to find solutions that avoid the world's complexity by imposing on it their own rules and functions. Evolution has resolved the problem of complexity not by simplifying but by finding solutions whose processes-though they can sometimes be complex-allow us to act in the midst of complexity and of uncertainty. Nature can inspire us by making us realize that simplification is never simple and requires instead that we choose, refuse, connect, and imagine, in order to act in the best possible manner. Such solutions are already being applied in design and engineering and are significant in biology, medicine, economics, and the behavioral sciences.<br>

Given the complexity of natural processes, the developing and growing brain must find solutions based on simplifying principles.

  Abstract: NOTHING MORE GLARINGLY ILLUSTRATES the academic world’s formidable ability to induce cluelessness than the university application process. More dramatically than anywhere else, the application process illustrates the failure of the academic club to socialize hopeful entrants into its customs, beliefs, and behaviors. This failure shows up at every link of the academic food chain, from high school students applying to college to college undergraduates applying to graduate school to graduate students applying for academic jobs and even to professors applying for grants.<br>

  THE POLYPHONIC ETHICS OF THE APOSTLE PAUL from:

  Abstract: In
                  Ethics and the Limits of PhilosophyBernard Williams has reminded us that moral conviction is not the same thing as certainty, nor can it be reduced to naked existential decision. What is required for a robust ethical life, writes Williams, is “moral confidence,” and moral confidence “is basically a social phenomenon.”¹ The study of the work of Paul acquires a new accent if we consider his letters in light of the question suggested by Williams’s argument: What is the social process by which a religious movement like that of the early Christians undertakes to instill moral confidence in its<br>

  2  THE GOD-ABSORBING TEXT: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn1r">Absorbing Perfections</a><br>
  Abstract: Ancient Jewish monotheism was generally uncomfortable with the idea of the preexistence of any entity to the creation of the world, a premise that would imperil the uniqueness of God as the single creator. The coexistence of an additional entity would produce a theological dynamics that would question the most singular religious achievement of ancient Judaism. Implicitly, allowing any role to such a founding and formative entity would reintroduce a type of myth that could recall the pagan mythology, where once again the relationship between the preexistent deities as a crucial condition for the cosmogonic process would be thrown into<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters I analyzed views of the Jewish canonical texts that I describe as “absorbing.” I use this term in order to convey the expanding comprehensiveness of the concept of the text which, moving to the center of the Jewish society, also integrated attributes reminiscent of wider entities like the world or God. This expansion facilitated the attribution of more dynamic qualities to the text conceived of as capable of allowing various types of influences on processes taking place in the world, in God, and in the human psyche.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn1r">Absorbing Perfections</a><br>
  Abstract: In its biblical forms, Judaism is a rather exoteric and democratic type of religiosity. The emphasis on making the teaching of the revealed instructions open to all classes of Israelites and the paramount importance of making religious actions open, in most cases, to all members of the nation, marginalize during the biblical phase of Judaism the surfacing and privileging of mysteries and secrets. Some of the subsequent phases of Judaism can, however, be described as part of an ongoing process of arcanization, to use a term I adopt from Jan Assmann,¹ which means that the common texts and actions become<br>

  Abstract: Recent progress in neuroscience and its integration in dynamic evolutionary processes, which include culture and its history, prompt us to rethink certain central philosophical questions, such as the significance of death. Death is an essential biological phenomenon directly related to the evolution of species. It has taken on a special dimension in the history of humanity. Buff on rightly said that “death is as natural as life.” Many philosophical and religious fundamentals, which emphasize the sacred character of life, maintain the balance by doing the same for its interruption by death.

  Abstract: If, as Benedict Anderson has suggested, the idea of a nation is in large measure imagined retrospectively, the Soviet Union offers an interesting counterpoint—that of a nation imagined prospectively.¹ The Soviet Union literally had to be invented. As is well known, cinema was expected to play a crucial role in this process. Surely it was for such a purpose that Lenin anointed cinema the premier socialist artform. Many Soviet films of the twenties were devoted to consolidating a tradition for the new nation, commemorating its revolutionary founding in historical spectacles, like V. I. Pudovkin’s

  Abstract: Several years ago I participated in a colloquium on the uses of psychoanalysis and Freudian models at the Hospital of La Salpêtrière in Paris: the place where Freud attended the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot’s lessons in 1885–86.¹ I lectured on what I called “The Image in the Picture,” speaking about Freud’s comments in the

How do we understand “understanding” itself, considered as a mental process involving both analyst and analysand? I want to approach these questions by way of the writing of the British post-Kleinian psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion (1897–1979) .

  Abstract: What relations are there between Freud’s theories of the mind and modern functional brain imaging experiments? To anchor this question, we present two statements from Mark Solms’s recent article about the nature of consciousness.¹ First, Solms emphasized Freud’s definition that “mental processes are in themselves unconscious,” arguing the relevance of this definition to modern controversies about brainmind-consciousness. We are willing to accept a moderate form of this position, in which the unconscious is acknowledged to contribute significantly to mental processes. The second quotation is less familiar: “psychoanalysis and PET scanning study one and the same underlying object: the mental apparatus<br>

The decade of the 1960s saw the convergence of a number of processes of change that would continue to alter the world toward the turn of the millennium. On a superficial level, the changes were evidenced by the emergence of an entirely new youth culture and new social movements on the world scene.

One does not need to use words such as

  Abstract: This paper aims to understand the meaning and role that Jaspers attributes to worldviews. By analysing the nature of the

The antinomicity of the lived process and the ambiguity that characterises the worldviews becomes clearer where Jaspers introduces the notion of limit situation. By analysing the relationship between theWeltanschauungenand the philosophical faith, the paper shows that theWeltanschauungen<br>

  Multiple Orientations within the Worldviews in Psychosis and Mysticism: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1p5f306">Karl Jaspers e la molteplicità delle visioni del mondo</a><br>
  Author(s) Ciglenečki Jan<br>
  Abstract: Prodromal and pre-psychotic states are characterized by pervasive instabilities on all levels of experience and could lead to what Karl Jaspers calls limit-situations (

In the process of defending against such existential instabilities or limit-situations, different strategies and mechanisms are employed to provide a shelter or enclosure (Gehäuse). In this article, we explore the transition from the limitsituations to enclosures in psychotic and mystical states. In both we can differentiate multiple orientations. Many individuals, who experience psychotic and mystical states, have in fact experiences of both, at least to some extent. Together with everyday, common-sense level of experience we can<br>

  Wahn, Weltanschauung und Habitus. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1p5f306">Karl Jaspers e la molteplicità delle visioni del mondo</a><br>
  Author(s) Thoma Samuel<br>
  Abstract: Karl Jaspers’ theory of delusion (
                  General Psychopathology, 1913/1946) is still widely discussed today, much unlike his theory of worldviews, laid out in his 1919 workPsychology of Worldviews, which has more or less fallen into oblivion. Based on Jaspers’ casuistic observations of nihilistic delusion and nihilistic worldview, as presented in 1919, we first analyze the relationship between delusion and worldview – a relationship analogous to that between “psychotic process” and “development of personality” in his concept of psychopathology. We then scrutinize this categorical distinction and its underlying methodical assumptions and consider possible links between delusion and worldview. Our conclusion is that,<br>

  Book Title: The Cruft of Fiction-Mega-Novels and the Science of Paying Attention<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): LETZLER DAVID<br>
  Abstract: While mega-novel text is often intricately meaningful or experimental, sometimes it is just excessive and pointless. On the other hand, mega-novels also contain text that, though appearing to be cruft, turns out to be quite important. Letzler posits that this cruft requires readers to develop a sophisticated method of attentional modulation, allowing one to subtly distinguish between text requiring focused attention and text that must be skimmed or even skipped to avoid processing failures.
      The Cruft of Fictionshows how the attentional maturation prompted by reading mega-novels can help manage the information overload that increasingly characterizes contemporary life.<br>

  Abstract: Though the previous chapters have used mega-novels’ relationships to several nonfictional genres to examine how their detailed accumulation of the facts of real life can overload readers’ attention capacities and subsequently prompt them to modulate their methods of text processing, cruft is not limited to the small-scale cases of the incoherent word, the irrelevant datum, the passing moment of consciousness. The following three chapters will examine how mega-novels’ incorporation of elements from other literary genres produces more extensive but equally pointless cruft, inducing the same characteristic frustration and boredom to provoke a similar reorientation of attention.

  Abstract: The past six chapters have analyzed how we process text in the meganovel, ranging from its sentence-level lacunae up to its macro-scale figurations of nation and world. Given how utterly mega-novel text overwhelms our limited working memory and how often it dissolves its most important text into a large amount of cruft, I have argued that we must hone our ability to modulate attention to an extremely fine degree, filtering the latter so as to better perceive the former. Some passages should be processed closely and slowly, while others should be read more quickly; some are best read distantly, and<br>

A historical and comparative overview of related terms – exile, émigré, expatriation, travel, emigration/immigration, diaspora, and nomadism – helps us understand displacement as a dynamic migrant experience that may range from being totally negative to very positive. Exiles are reconciled to their present predicament and have nostalgic feelings for the past; émigrés are actively involved in the contemporary literary process in the homeland and seek to return; emigrants/immigrants integrate and adapt themselves<br>

  Book Title: The Priority of Injustice-Locating Democracy in Critical Theory<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Doshi Sapana<br>
  Abstract: Debates about radical democracy, Barnett argues, have become trapped around a set of oppositions between deliberative and agonistic theories-contrasting thinkers who promote the possibility of rational agreement and those who seek to unmask the role of power or violence or difference in shaping human affairs. While these debates are often framed in terms of consensus versus contestation, Barnett unpacks the assumptions about space and time that underlie different understandings of the sources of political conflict and shows how these differences reflect deeper philosophical commitments to theories of creative action or revived ontologies of "the political." Rather than developing ideal theories of democracy or models of proper politics, he argues that attention should turn toward the practices of claims-making through which political movements express experiences of injustice and make demands for recognition, redress, and re pair. By rethinking the spatial grammar of discussions of public space, democratic inclusion, and globalization, Barnett develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the crucial roles played by geographical processes in generating and processing contentious politics.<br>

For them, building a theory of it means proposing an alternative system of information-processing, paratactic to the everyday rational system. They revert to the lower orders of the soul by a process of elimination. Since divination seems not to have a place in the normal modes of thinking, they propose that some other form of insight dwells in the soul’s other parts, situated closely to our creaturely selves. In Plato’s case, we have the appetitive soul on occasion finding its<br>

It enters into our awareness and offers incremental insight into what is around the corner. They construe it as a feature of human nature, as embedded in physiological processes that have to do with our status as embodied organisms situated in a surrounding atmosphere of stimuli.

No other sign system achieves this. The image, although more effective than the word in presenting in a solitary, contained way what it represents, cannot comment on its object or analyze its own method of representation as language can. Similarly, gesture, or enactment, while performing what it represents and, in this sense, closer to its object, cannot reflect upon itself or the nature of its own operation.

  Abstract: In this completely revised edition of one of the foundational texts of network sociology, Harrison White refines and enlarges his groundbreaking theory of how social structure and culture emerge from the chaos and uncertainty of social life. Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro,
      Identity and Controlpresents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.<br>

As such it exhibits a distinctive texture in social process, sensed by those immediately involved. Analytically, style can be of any scope and level: it is a scale-invariant concept. And whatever the scope, two basic aspects of style come intertwined: (a) the interpretive tone along with (b) the feedback dynamics. Style is not transposable, though it may get reconstituted.<br>

They draw heavily on structural equivalence as they invoke story-sets across networks. Blockmodels, introduced in chapter 2, can suggest architectures, blueprints for institutional systems.

A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought. The hypotheses of investigation rest on two levels of Lorand Gaspar’s writing: the epistemological dimension and the cognitive value of the poetic discourse. Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation. Three theoretical chapters organize the investigation of some of the processes of the poetical thought: Perception, Emotion and Metaphor. This research takes place in an argumentation that favors transdisciplinarity by means of literary analysis strategies, which integrate several considerations of interdisciplinary nature.Cette Thèse s’articule autour des relations entre la poésie et la science.

  Author(s) PAULS DJ<br>
  Abstract: Motherhood is an identity common to women in all societies, but the expression of it varies greatly both within and across social groups. Mothering emerges from the intersection of a woman’s personality, her life experiences, and choices available to her, and is embedded in gender role expectations shaped by religion, culture, and historical context. Every woman constructs her own expression of motherhood through a process of accepting and resisting role expectations. The process of establishing individual motherhood priorities may be covert or overt—likely influenced by the consequences of the choices. Thus the social construction of motherhood is dynamic and<br>

  Representations of Birth and Motherhood as Contemporary Forms of the Sacred from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd8tc">Natal Signs</a><br>
  Author(s) HENNESSEY ANNA<br>
  Abstract: This paper examines ways in which images of birth and the maternal body are contemporary forms of the sacred, and, controversially, how their production represents a renewed interest in birth and mothering as primary sources of empowerment for many women. Through research in art history, religious studies, philosophy, medical anthropology, and feminism, I first show how members of an international movement devoted to birth and art are actively using religious, secular, and re-sacralized art imagery in the visualization of labour and birth and as a ritualistic part of birth as a rite of passage. While this process of ritualizing art<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine the social landscape of femininity to contextualize women’s fear of pain in childbirth. For many women, vaginal delivery has become something to avoid. Trends in medicalization and surgical intervention (including increased rates of elective cesarean section) suggest that childbirth need not involve labour (both generally, in terms of effortful work, and specifically, in terms of the three stages of the birth process). In this chapter, I consider what has motivated this trend towards increased medicalization of birth, with an eye towards the cultural features of our social world. In particular, I suggest that the components<br>

  Abstract: Noted anthropologist clifford geertz defines culture as “the ensemble of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves” (448). In keeping with this theory, Fred Inglis suggests that identity is formed through a process whereby we observe and “inhabit the narratives of how to live” available within a given culture (“Culture and Sentiment” 2). Such narratives generally reflect the dominant discourse and accepted range of meanings in relation to socially defined roles. In terms of the negotiated meaning of motherhood, however, there is a growing tension between competing narratives and representations that highlight the juxtaposition between culturally constructed fantasies of maternal perfection<br>

  Author(s) AYOB ASMA<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary bollywood filmmakers are increasingly questioning the links between the depiction of women, patriarchy, and national discourses that were considered normative in the early 1900s. The representation of mother figures in popular Bollywood films¹ has changed considerably over the years. This paper explores the representations of “ diasporic” mother figures as portrayed in popular films post-1990 and takes into consideration the effects of feminist consciousness, which, in turn, has been fuelled by globalization. Indian diaspora audiences are increasingly engaging in processes of identification with the themes of Bollywood films. As Gokulsing and Dissanayake rightfully note, diasporic Bollywood films promote modernization,<br>

  Abstract: Lifecourse research is undertaken by researchers from across the social sciences, often working in a multidisciplinary context, using the lifecourse as an underpinning concept and/or a method of study. In this book we aim to represent the diversity of lifecourse methodologies employed in the social sciences, as well as having a concern for epistemology – how different knowledge claims are connected to our research practices. Moreover, the contributors in this edited book emphasise how different theoretical frameworks and positionality affect the research process – each contributor examines the challenges of their research design and how they worked through methodological issues<br>

  Author(s) Akesson Bree<br>
  Abstract: Mapmaking can be a process by which individuals orient themselves and navigate from place to place. The process of mapmaking can also be used as a tool for understanding one’s sense of place. The mapmaking experience is rooted in what Sobel (1998, p 5) identifies as ‘our visual, kinesthetic, and emotional experiences’. As a visual method, mapmaking provides one example of how individuals engage with place. Individuals throughout the lifecourse – from young children to ageing adults – influence and are influenced by place. And in order to better understand individuals’ experience with place, research methodologies have increasingly turned to<br>

I begin by presenting a discussion of my conceptualisation of retirement migration and then unravel my approach to theory, explaining how women’s experiences and agency are placed within wider structural contexts. I explore how understanding of retirement migration is gained through a thematic and structural narrative analytic approach centring on plot, time, identity or positionality and an analysis of linguistic devices employed.

I argued that a thematic and structural narrative approach can illuminate how retired women experience the structural contexts in which their migration takes place, how this shapes agency,¹ and how structures and agency are mediated by their multiple and shifting positionalities. In this chapter I discuss the macro contexts framing retired women’s agency in migration in terms of ‘upper structural layers’ and ‘more proximate structural layers’ (O’Reilly, 2012).

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I suggested that thinking with community and how – and to what – people construct belonging illuminates processes of social change and continuity from particular social locations or positions. Retirement migration was presented as a form and consequence of social change, involving both boundary spanning and reconstitution. The important role of nostalgia as a cultural resource in constructing belonging to different forms of community, evoking an imagined lost place or time, particularly for older people was also considered. In this chapter, I explore the reasons for women’s dislocation in and from the UK, and the decision-making<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have followed women’s migration journeys across space and time as they spanned and reconstituted boundaries. Beginning with their pre-migration lives – characterised for many by fractured belonging in the UK – upper and more proximate structures enabled and facilitated their agency in moving to Spain in retirement. We have also seen that women’s positionalities and unique biographies are also significant in shaping migration choices, decision-making processes and their post-migration lives. I framed divergent migration trajectories in relation to two plot typologies: the quest and voyage and return. Those women who ultimately chose to remain in Spain<br>

  Author(s): Gilleard Chris<br>
  Abstract: How do we sustain agency and identity amidst the frailty of advanced old age? What role does care play in this process? Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by age and infirmity. It begins with a theoretical examination of the fourth age, interrogating notions of agency, identity and personhood, as well as the impact of frailty, abjection and ‘othering’. It then applies this analysis to issues of care. Exploring our collective hopes and fears concerning old age and the ends of people’s lives, this is essential reading on one of the biggest social issues of our time.Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by ageing, and the associated problems of mental and physical frailty in later life.<br>

By 2050 the world will be home to some 1.5 billion people aged 65 and over, more agedness than the world has ever experienced.

  Abstract: Throughout Europe, standardised approaches to social policy and practice are being radically questioned and modified. Beginning from the narrative detail of individual lives, this book re-thinks welfare predicaments, emphasising gender, generation, ethnic and class implications of economic and social deregulation.Based on 250 life-story interviews in seven European Union countries, Biography and social exclusion in Europe: analyses personal struggles against social exclusion to illuminate local milieus and changing welfare regimes and contexts; points to challenging new agendas for European politics and welfare, beyond the rhetoric of communitarianism and the New Deal; vividly illustrates the lived experience and environmental complexity working for and against structural processes of social exclusion; refashions the interpretive tradition as a teaching and research tool linking macro and micro realities. · · Students, academic teachers and professional trainers, practitioners, politicians, policy makers and researchers in applied and comparative welfare fields will all benefit from reading this book.<br>

  Book Title: Biographical methods and professional practice-An international perspective<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Apitzsch Ursula<br>
  Abstract: The turn to biographical methods in social science is invigorating the relationship between policy and practice. This book shows how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the development of professionals, and promote more meaningful practitioner - service user relationships.This book uses a range of interpretive approaches to reveal the dynamics of service users' and professionals' individual experiences and life-worlds. From their research the contributors show how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the learning and development of professionals, and promote more meaningful and creative practitioner - service user relationships. The book: · reviews applications of biographical methods in both policy and practice in a range of professional contexts, from health and social care to education and employment; · explores the impact of social change in three main arenas - transformation from Eastern to Western types of society in Europe, major shifts in social and welfare principles, experiences of immigration and of new cultural diversities - on professional practice; · critically evaluates subjective and reflexive processes in interactions between researchers, practitioners and users of services; · considers the institutional arrangements and cultural contexts which support effective and sensitive interventions; · draws on actual projects and tracks reflection, progress and outcomes. With contributions from leading international experts, it provides a valuable comparative perspective. Researchers, policy analysts and practitioners, postgraduate students, teachers and trainers will find this book a stimulating read.<br>

  Abstract: The rapid expansion of biographical methods comes at a time of frustration with a number of aspects of social policy, such as positivistic, top–down approaches, the failure to solve issues of expense, efficiency and dependency, and the cultural lag between welfare systems and social change¹. European welfare systems, already under pressure from neoliberal forces, must reorient to new social realities in the labour market, in relations between public and private spheres, in gender relations, and in notions of citizenship and democratic agency. Biographical methods provide a tool for reconnecting welfare systems with lived experience and processes of social change,<br>

  Author(s) Cooper Andrew<br>
  Abstract: This chapter asks questions about the conceptualisation of the ontology of the social subject that informs biographical methods of research. Arguing from a psychoanalytically informed view of the subject, I suggest that emotionality and creativity as it derives from our capacity to dream (or what Freud referred to as primary process thinking), and our hesitant and uncertain development as subjects out of infantile states of near complete inarticulacy, are all necessary dimensions of a fully developed concept of what it is to be a subject.<br>

These stories emerge from a teaching programme in which final-year sociology students are involved in biographical research. Students write a life-story narrative drawn from multiple interviews with a single narrator, as well as a research journal, in which they offer an autobiographical account of their research process. They also submit an analytical essay; that is, a sociological commentary that locates<br>

  Author(s) Bradley Quintin<br>
  Abstract: This statement and the legislation that followed it unleashed a new wave of community-based planning in England. As one of a range of rights and powers introduced by the localism agenda of 2011, neighbourhood groups were able to draw up statutory land-use plans, thereby creating a new tier in the planning framework. Five years later, with close to 2,000 neighbourhoods formally engaged in the process, it was clear that neighbourhood planning had emerged as one of the most widespread community initiatives in recent years and one of the most current topics within spatial planning. As such, it demands further investigation,<br>

  Abstract: This chapter situates international debates on participation and the widening of democratic engagement in the context of initiatives in the English planning system. It discusses the devolution of neighbourhood planning powers to local communities from 2011 and draws parallels with traditions of citizens’ control and direct action in land-use planning. It asks whether neighbourhood planning can be said to devolve some kind of ‘power to the people’. In doing so, the chapter argues for an understanding of participation not as a process of inclusion, but as a political practice founded on the inevitability of antagonism and conflict.

  Abstract: Planning in France has always been a state affair. In the 17th century, a territorial administration was created to implement the rational organisation of space through centralised infrastructure as the cornerstone of the new-born nation state and, from the late 18th century, a vector for republican values (Foucault, 1975). In the late 20th century, despite a shift towards decentralisation that saw private actors taking a central role in urban planning, things remained fundamentally unchanged. By defining and implementing urban laws, including the process for the declaration of public utility, national and local government remain responsible for orchestrating spatial planning.¹ This<br>

  Abstract: Literary representations of momentous historical events often focus on the experiences, emotions, perceptions, and understanding of individuals; perhaps only thus can empathy be realized in acts of writing and reading. The individual’s perspective also allows one to ponder the margins of agency and responsibility.

To realise this goal, they endeavour to prevent the decay – or further decay – of their artefacts by, first, treating these objects with extreme caution and trying, as much as possible, to limit the destructive impact of environmental factors (Pomian, 1988: 14); and, second, cleaning and restoring them, repairing the damage that inevitably accrues over time. Both of these activities can be categorised as part of the ‘preservation process’.<br>

  Do Postmodern Genres Exist? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xtv6">Genre Theory and Historical Change</a><br>
  Abstract: Critics and theorists who write about postmodern texts often refer to “genres” as a term inappropriate for characterizing postmodernist writing. The process of suppression results from the claim that postmodern writing blurs genres, transgresses them, or unfixes boundaries that conceal domination or authority, and that “genre” is an anachronistic term and concept. When critics offer examples of postmodern novels, for example, they cite omniscient authors who are parodied or undermined. They point to selfconscious addresses to the reader in

  Abstract: This first chapter focuses on political conceptualisations of popular culture in France, by which I mean conceptualisations developed by governments, parties, national institutions and the kind of public intellectuals who, as Ahearne (2010: 2) puts it, ‘have moved in and out of positions within public policy processes’. Other chapters in this volume will be concerned with popular-cultural artefacts themselves. My focus here is on how such artefacts have been institutionally represented over time. For if, as Kuisel claims, France itself is an invention, a conceptualisation, this is in part due to the way its popular culture has represented it and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1w0ddq5">Negative Cosmopolitanism</a><br>
  Author(s) Ugor Paul<br>
  Abstract: Both as a moral and political project, cosmopolitanism is invested in a universalism that promotes the impartial treatment of all human beings, irrespective of one’s place of birth, ethnicity, race, gender/sexuality, or religion. Cosmopolitanism, then, is committed to a process of internationalization in which human beings everywhere are world citizens with basic rights grounded in natural law, that is, with rights which cannot be denied by any person(s), group(s), institution(s), or constituted authority, including the nation-state. Stressing the rights of the individual rather than those of the sovereign state, cosmopolitanism thus favours what Brown and Held call a “non-national sense<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, we explore the disconnect between New York City College of Technology (City Tech) students’ working-class subjectivities and the traditional implementation of first-year composition (FYC) pedagogy. We articulate the relationship between institutional realities, pedagogical tradition, and students’ needs and how these intersections of institutionality and students’ lives do not connect our students’ working-class subjectivities to the educational project of FYC. We raise three questions we believe must be explored as part of the process of creating tangible changes to how teachers and scholars of FYC approach urban working-class students.<br>

  Abstract: College instructors who wish to help first-year working-class students transition from high school to college are often tasked with teasing out the array of intentions working-class students have for attending college. Working-class students attend college for a variety of reasons that have been well documented,² and supporting them in the classroom is not necessarily easy.

  Author(s) Pelletier Martine<br>
  Abstract: Though the choice of 1990 as a watershed year demarcating ‘old’ Ireland from ‘new’, modern, Ireland may be a convenient simplification that ignores or plays down a slow, complex, ongoing process, it is nonetheless true to say that in recent years Ireland has undergone something of a revolution. Economic success, the so-called ‘Celtic Tiger’ phenomenon, and its attendant socio-political consequences, has given the country a new confidence whilst challenging or eroding the old markers of Irish identity.

In this chapter, therefore, we shall concentrate on aspects of his thought that shed light on his account of the faith process—a process he viewed as much broader and deeper than any rationalist methodology.

  Abstract: New thinking in queer temporalities and affects outside of the (temporally, affectively charged) field of religion constitutes a challenge and invitation to stretch queer thinking in theology yet again, and further. Although feminist, womanist, process, and other theorists in religion and theology have been working around the fuzzy borders and stubborn impasses that fleshy experiences—bodies and histories of bodies—present, queerly inflected affect theory expands these moves into a complex materialism.¹ Affect theory’s approach to embodiment in terms of the deeply constitutive dynamics of temporality, proximity, touch, and even elemental gravitation provides a conceptual framework that helpfully limits any<br>

  Abstract: We know things, Piaget claims, because we construct epistemic structures, which function as necessary conditions for knowledge. In this process our epistemic structures become progressively more adequate. This constructivism, whatever conceptual flaws it may have, lies at the heart of Piaget’s theory of knowledge. An attempt to provide such a theory of knowledge we labelled “epistemology proper” or “normative epistemology.” Piaget’s constructivism, I suggested, is a theory about how we actually know. Constructivism can be viewed as an answer to the earlier (transcendental) question; how is it possible (developmentally) for us to have the knowledge we have? Piaget answers that<br>

The seemingly contradictory commentary that her work sustains proves her success in “con-fusing” romantic and modernist oppositions: she has been read as an autobiographical poet with an impersonal touch, as a surrealist given to meticulous observations of natural facts, and as a formalist whose poems are open-ended accumulations of detail.¹ Her distinction is to have developed the kind of diction and formal flexibility that enable her to be at home on<br>

  Abstract: Having set out the superordinate dimensions of our analysiscognitive science versus organismic—holistic cognition, Freud versus Jung, representational versus presentational symbolism, and causal process versus meaning—we complete our review of the literature by considering the more specific antinomies of current dream research. Each side of these contrasting dimensions is supported by important research findings and consistent theory. This in itself may illustrate the actual multiplicity of the processes of dreaming. It is equally important to locate whatever syntheses are afforded by this material and to understand them as necessarily provisional and temporary-both because of the open-ended and indeterminate nature<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sfz">The Multiplicity of Dreams</a><br>
  Abstract: Nineteenth-century dream studies, prior to Freud, continue to fascinate, in part because they are based on careful observations by single individuals (and their like-minded friends) of their own often distinctive and unusually developed dreams. Precisely because long, sustained self-reflection on dreams seemed to change their dreams in mulitple but characteristic directions, these writers also cast a unique light on normative dreaming (at least within our own tradition). William James, Sigmund Freud, and A. R. Luria all held that only the selective exaggeration of the average allows us to see its normally masked dimensions and processes. On this approach exaggeration, excess,<br>

  CHAPTER 7  Specific Imaginative-Intuitive Faculties as Forms of Dreaming from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sfz">The Multiplicity of Dreams</a><br>
  Abstract: Evidence of creative imagistic activity in dream formation does not encourage us to assimilate all dreaming to representational language. Still, the difficulty in evaluating when dream imagery goes beyond prior verbal understanding suggests that imagery and language must continuously interact anyway. The linguistic processes that enter dreams most readily are more presentational than representational—in that “the whole domain of verbal wit is put at the disposal of the dreamwork” (Freud, 1900, p. 376). Certainly, in many of Freud’s own dreams ordinary language has been spontaneously rearranged in the form of rebuslike wordplay, visual hieroglyphics based on special turns of<br>

  CHAPTER 10  Freud, Jung, and Culture Pattern Dreams: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sfz">The Multiplicity of Dreams</a><br>
  Abstract: It is quite clear that Freud’s and Jung’s dreams differed markedly in style or form-yet with enough overlap to suggest that they represent variations within a single dreaming process. The old saw that Freudian patients dream Freudian dreams, and Jungians dream Jungian, also seems likely, although causation is less clear. Dreaming is socially malleable, but given the differences in the dreams of the founders, it may well be that people are drawn to one tradition or the other because it mirrors their lives (awake and asleep).<br>

  CHAPTER 11  Narrative Structures: from:

  Abstract: Any cognitive psychology of dreaming must encounter and reconcile two statements: “the dream is a story” and “the dream is imagery.” Neither statement is as obvious as it initially appears, I I because there is no agreement in contemporary cognitive psychology on the ultimate relation between visual-spatial imagery and language. Much evidence and theory supports both the view that a visual-spatial imagistic intelligence rests directly on and creatively reorganizes the processes of perception and the view that mental imagery is a surface paraphrase of abstract propositional knowledge, whose deep structure is accordingly far closer to verbal syntax than visual imagery.<br>

  Book Title: Points of Departure-Rethinking Student Source Use and Writing Studies Research Methods<br>
  Publisher: Utah State University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAMIESON SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: Points of Departureencourages a return to empirical research about writing, presenting a wealth of transparent, reproducible studies of student sources. The volume shows how to develop methods for coding and characterizing student texts, their choice of source material, and the resources used to teach information literacy. In so doing, the volume advances our understanding of how students actually write.The contributors offer methodologies, techniques, and suggestions for research that move beyond decontextualized guides to grapple with the messiness of research-in-process, as well as design, development, and expansion. Serviss and Jamieson's model of RAD writing studies research is transcontextual and based on hybridized or mixed methods. Among these methods are citation context analysis, research-aloud protocols, textual and genre analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups, with an emphasis on process and knowledge as contingent. Chapters report on research projects at different stages and across institution types-from pilot to multi-site, from community college to research university-focusing on the methods and artifacts employed.A rich mosaic of research about research,Points of Departureadvances knowledge about student writing and serves as a guide for both new and experienced researchers in writing studies.Contributors: Crystal Benedicks, Katt Blackwell-Starnes, Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch, Kristi Murray Costello, Anne Diekema, Rebecca Moore Howard, Sandra Jamieson, Elizabeth Kleinfeld, Brian N.

  Abstract: One of the great challenges and opportunities of educational research is rectifying predictions about how learning theoretically works with how learning
                  actuallyworks in—and across—different contexts. Those of us who study writing and literacy are uniquely aware of these tensions. In fact, writing studies research traditionally inquires into how beautifully divergent and surprising learning can be in practice. Conversations about writing processes in 1960s writing-pedagogy research embody this tension; theoretical understandings oftypicalprocesses of developing writers became dangerously calcified intothewriting process quite quickly.

  Hyperbole and Humor in Whitman and Dickinson from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1z27hqz">Whitman & Dickinson</a><br>
  Author(s) MILLER CRISTANNE<br>
  Abstract: There is a long, if somewhat sporadic, history of scholarship acknowledging both Whitman and Dickinson as humorists.¹ Still, these poets’ exaggerated or hyperbolic claims are often read seriously, making Whitman seem egotistical and Dickinson depressed or without self-esteem. In this essay, we argue that the figure of hyperbole is both intrinsically linked with humor and a key element in what makes both poets’ work at once colloquially familiar and radically disorienting. For Whitman and Dickinson the use of hyperbole extends other features of their work that defamiliarize and disorient readers’ values, perceptions, and cognitive processes, while simultaneously creating the effect<br>

  In the Interests of Social Pedagogy: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxshr0">Close Encounters</a><br>
  Abstract: Three things may be said about the lifelong polemic of Maxim Gorky (1868–1936) with Dostoevsky. First, it had deep psychological roots in a confrontation with aspects of his own nature; overcoming Dostoevsky, for Gorky, was a process of self-overcoming. Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Author(s) Felson Nancy<br>
  Abstract: One of Charles S. Peirce’s fundamental contributions to the study of sign processes is to provide an analytic vocabulary for describing the intersecting vectors involved in all semiosis, a vector of the “representation” of some object by expressive signs that stand for it and a vector of “determination” of this sign relationship by subsequent interpreting signs, what he called “interpretants.” One way to visualize the temporal linkage of these two vectors is to consider how the same interpretants look “backward” at the signs that determine them, especially as they creatively construe or apprehend the original sign relation as having a<br>

  Abstract: The 1948 War is remembered in this special volume, including aspects of Israeli-Jewish memory and historical narratives of 1948 and representations of Israeli-Palestinian memory of that cataclysmic event and its consequences. The contributors map and analyze a range of perspectives of the 1948 War as represented in literature, historical museums, art, visual media, and landscape, as well as in competing official and societal narratives. They are examined especially against the backdrop of the Oslo process, which brought into relief tensions within and between both sides of the national divide concerning identity and legitimacy, justice, and righteousness of "self" and "other."<br>

  Abstract: This volume consists of a collection of studies of Israeli representations, both Jewish and Palestinian, of memory and historical narratives of the 1948 War. The studies map and explain some Israeli-Jewish and Israeli-Palestinian perspectives of the 1948 War as represented in literature, historical museums, art, visual media, and landscape, as well as in competing official and societal narratives.

  Author(s) McAfee Noëlle<br>
  Abstract: Marshall mcluhan began his curious little book of 1967,
                  The Medium Is the Massage, with an epigraph by Alfred North Whitehead: “The major advances in civilization are processes that all but wreck the societies in which they occur.”¹ For McLuhan’s purposes, the meaning is clear. The old world became undone by the literacy that the printing press created. Literate readers of the Bible no longer needed to defer to priests for the word of God, which led to the Protestant Reformation and shortly thereafter to new ideas about government legitimacy, heralding the English, American, and French revolutions.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005th6">Cosmopolitanism and Place</a><br>
  Author(s) Failache Juan Carlos Pereda<br>
  Abstract: Socialization processes normally imply that we stimulate and praise—or discourage and scorn—some of our desires. And something comparable happens to our beliefs, emotions, interests, and, of course, to our actions. A tradition or cultural heritage is not just something out there; it entails a complex, and usually implicit, social normativity. However, communities also make explicit, in a fragmentary way, that normativity by means of codes, regulations, exhortations, suggestions, prohibitions, historical narratives, monuments, songs—all in a more or less vague and inconsistent manner. Is this how a public normativity becomes rooted in every person’s life?<br>

  Author(s) Colapietro Vincent<br>
  Abstract: This chapter is first and foremost a reflection on place, precisely as a verb—that is, not as an antecedently fixed container or enclosure, but as a historically evolved and evolving set of processes and practices. While unavoidably abstract in some respects, it is pointedly political and, to a less extent, polemical. For I am taking this occasion to urge a shift from a politics of occupation (including dwelling) to one of cohabitation, based on a reconstructed self-understanding of ourselves as

  Author(s) FIELDING HELEN A.<br>
  Abstract: Openness to the world and to the future belongs to personal time intertwined with impersonal or natural time, which is at the heart of phenomenology. Humans, as phenomenal subjects, make sense of the world they encounter, and in so doing they have the potential to enact change. However, as embodied, they also have the ability to be shaped by it—and in this age the world that shapes humans is largely indifferent to this phenomenal potential. They gear into a world that too often does not connect personal and impersonal time with the processes or systems in which they are<br>

  Author(s) SLATMAN JENNY<br>
  Abstract: What is it that happens in interviews that aim at exploring people’s lived experiences? In a recently conducted empirical study, we interviewed women just after they were surgically treated for breast cancer.¹ In these interviews we focused on how they gave meaning to bodily changes and to their scars, thus employing a phenomenological approach. Phenomenology is mostly seen as an investigation of the first-person perspective, because it seeks to make explicit the process of world-disclosure.² Because of its sensitivity to the way patients experience their illnesses, phenomenology has been developed as a research method in its own right that is<br>

  Abstract: The way people construct themselves—and are constructed by others—takes place against the larger discursive frame or backdrop that is culture. Or better, groups construct themselves and others against historical frames that produce culture in the present, and that simultaneously reconstruct the events of the past. That is to say: our narratives about the past explain the way we find ourselves circumscribed in the present. History is constructed to explain the present; historical trajectories determine the cultural or symbolic terms of engagement through which group identities are articulated and against which they are defined.

  Book Title: The Colonial Legacy in France-Fracture, Rupture, and Apartheid<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pernsteiner Alexis<br>
  Abstract: Debates about the legacy of colonialism in France are not new, but they have taken on new urgency in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Responding to acts of religious and racial violence in 2005, 2010, and 2015 and beyond, the essays in this volume pit French ideals against government-sponsored revisionist decrees that have exacerbated tensions, complicated the process of establishing and recording national memory, and triggered divisive debates on what it means to identify as French. As they document the checkered legacy of French colonialism, the contributors raise questions about France and the contemporary role of Islam, the banlieues, immigration, race, history, pedagogy, and the future of the Republic. This innovative volume reconsiders the cultural, economic, political, and social realities facing global French citizens today and includes contributions by Achille Mbembe, Benjamin Stora, Françoise Vergès, Alec Hargreaves,Elsa Dorlin,and Alain Mabanckou, among others.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt20060bg">The Colonial Legacy in France</a><br>
  Author(s) Lapeyronnie Didier<br>
  Abstract: Over the past twenty years, life in disadvantaged neighborhoods or

These have included the implementation of protectionist, but isolationist, measures and efforts aimed at restoring “social order” through a process of group segmentation. Communication across gender lines in these neighborhoods has diminished, identities have become increasingly ethnicized, and the importance of religion has been amplified. Today’s France is witnessing the creation of ghettos, neighborhoods populated by what are effectively second-class citizens, and who have become increasingly withdrawn into their own communities as a reaction to their lack of integration.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt20060bg">The Colonial Legacy in France</a><br>
  Author(s) Blanchard Pascal<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about memory in France is to touch upon a crucial civic value,¹ one that is marked by a bad conscience, commemorations, and even manipulations.² A perfect history does not in fact exist,³ and nor does a perfect memory. If writing history is a process—it can be corrected, recontextualized, reformulated—memory is, at the moment it is articulated, a source of imagination, newfound awareness, and conflict. Its impact—both socially and politically—is immediate and indelible. It leaves its mark on the social imaginary.⁴ Memory is therefore an issue that should be considered with much precaution and distance. But<br>

  Author(s) Thomas Dominic<br>
  Abstract: When it comes to the question of colonialism in France, more often than not, the tendency is to conjure a range of “philanthropic” or “humanist” measures. This is somehow deemed necessary in the process of extracting populations residing is farflung places out of the heart of darkness, and thereby justifying overseas colonial expansion. As a consequence, there has been no real debate on these and related questions, even though formerly colonized peoples and their descendants continue to be the object of racial prejudice and subjected to humiliation. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to alleviate tensions and to encourage the authorities<br>

  Author(s) Blake Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: THE VARIOUS LABELS

  Abstract: The twenty principles of the mimetic hypothesis that I describe in this chapter are meant to specify the nature of mimetic comprehension of music.¹ The role of mimetic comprehension in music conceptualization (chaps. 4–6) and in the creation of musical affect (chaps. 8 and 9) reflects the details and variables considered here. Although the extent of variability means that mimetic processes do not provide a uniform basis for conceptualization and affective responses, this variability appears to be integral to the nature of musical experience, conceptualization, and meaning.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt200610s">Music and Embodied Cognition</a><br>
  Abstract: Beyond the spatial metaphors examined in chapters 4–6 are those that draw upon the various senses to conceptualize properties of pitch, timbre, and strength, such as color (chromaticism; timbre as color), clarity, brightness/darkness, softness (piano), strength (forte), warmth, sharpness, sweetness (dolce), and so forth. But as useful as such particular concepts may be, and as interesting as the reasoning processes that produce them may be, in this chapter I focus on the broader topic of how the external senses shape our relationship with the world, including our relationship with music.<br>

In addition to specific processes, this includes an essential variability in how these play out in different musical practices, among different individuals, and even for a given individual at different points in one’s life. Specialists might rightly note the many sources I have excluded and the avenues I have only pointed toward or overlooked, but I have attempted to offer a coherent story of the relationship among metaphor, embodiment, and affect—or among concept, flesh, and feeling.

  Abstract: One of the main questions related to the process of Sovietization in Eastern and Central Europe is whether there were any common points in the vision or direct political aspirations of the conquerors and the conquered, at least on the level of the political elites. If they did share any visions and ideas, we can assume that these may have facilitated to a certain extent a peaceful Sovietization by means of ‘soft’ methods even in societies that had been originally rather unfriendly towards communist policies.

  Abstract: Levinas’s critique of narrative and the conception of the narrating subject that underlies it leads him to the issue of how time is synchronized in the philosophy of history, where the process of abstraction from the singular other is most prominent. By interpreting the significance of disparate events and integrating them into a coherent account, the disciplinary approaches of history typically assume a formal conception of time, in which a linear chronology can be represented by consciousness. In other words, past events are treated as intentional objects. This synchronization of time entails generalizing from people’s experiences, selectively emphasizing certain elements<br>

  Abstract: There is a strong feeling that the multitudinous traditional ways of making and creativity are slowly being absorbed into one dominant way of making and thinking. This process of homogenization is not new, but it has reached unprecedented levels today. To see the difference, it is enough to recall the nature and the depth of discussions, in the early decades of the present century, about creativity in different domains of culture, about the relation between art and science or technology, about the nature and status of the applied arts, industrial design, and so on – in such movements, for example,<br>

La notion de la représentation au centre d’un tel discours renoue avec le symbolique en tant que sens permanent de l’architecture; elle révèle également la profondeur des processus engagés dans le questionnement des modes de représentation de l’espace à travers l’histoire.

I just gave a quick overview of the “hybridization” of conservatism and liberalism at the beginning of the nineteenth century (and earlier) as

  Author(s) Rhee Helen<br>
  Abstract: Christian eschatology and otherworldliness have been used and misused throughout history. On the one hand, they were used by Christians to justify maintaining the socio-political or religious status quo resulting in either a tragic neglect of social injustice or a passivity toward social reforms in the present age.¹ On the other hand, they were used to justify socio-political and religious radicalism and violence to the point that Christianity may be seen in some quarters as a militant opponent of social process and tolerance.² While it is true that the eschatological orientation and “otherworldliness” of early Christian teachings did not directly<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851jw">The One, the Many, and the Trinity</a><br>
  Abstract: Process-relational metaphysics demands careful attention. Like classical metaphysics, process metaphysics is too often quickly dismissed by those who do not understand it or fail to grasp its significance. Too often have contemporary philosophers and theologians viewed process thought as a recent curiosity that must be relegated to the memory of twentieth-century intellectual anomalies. This is because neither the questions process metaphysics addresses nor its complex and sophisticated answers are adequately understood, let alone appreciated. This work tries to treat process thought with the detail and thoroughness required to grasp its true significance. Theologians and philosophers doing metaphysics, as well those<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851jw">The One, the Many, and the Trinity</a><br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken, S.J., is a process thinker of unique importance. As one of the few process theologians working from within the Catholic tradition, Bracken has produced an unparalleled synthesis of the Catholic tradition and modern process metaphysics. In doing so, he is a living exemplar of how historically the best Catholic philosophers and theologians have seriously engaged the intellectual currents of their day. Bracken is important for Catholics thinkers because he makes a well-informed case that process metaphysics must not be rashly dismissed but seriously considered as a necessary rethinking of metaphysics in our day.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851jw">The One, the Many, and the Trinity</a><br>
  Abstract: I have argued that process thought in general and Bracken’s theology in particular simultaneously generate the so-called problem of the one and the many and are unable to solve it, because they relegate metaphysics, including the metaphysics of ultimate reality, to principles that have classically been understood as applying to created reality only. Before examining how classical theism might respond to the problem of the one and the many with reference to the distinction between finite and transcendent being, or the Creator-creature distinction, I will point to ways in which it appears that process thinkers themselves do not avoid this<br>

  Abstract: The production of the bipartite Christian Bible is the result of a process of reception and tradition involving the interpretative organon of the 
                  sensus fidei. This organon is at work from the very start of the Jesus tradition till the written expression par excellence of that tradition in the canon of New Testament writings, with its constant theological presupposition—the Jewish Scriptures. With the Gospel written onto their hearts, the believing disciples remembered, retold, and applied their faith in Jesus Christ out of their shared experience of that Gospel. This hermeneutical process involves the understanding, interpretation, and application of Jesus<br>

  Abstract: Near the beginning of the

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853wm">The Texture of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: Metaphors of language sometimes express a reality that stricter and more modest conceptions do not express so well. Moreover, some striking metaphors, such as the “death of God,” can give expression to real conditions in our culture. The intention of this essay is to sketch a current problematic—the widespread acceptance of the absence of God in the cultures of technologically advanced societies of the so-called Western type¹—and to suggest a strategy for a metaphysical intervention in that problematic. The temporal field within which the paper moves is the 
                  process of modernization over the past four hundred years, principally<br>

  Abstract: What happens to the narrator in Elstir’s studio is one of the novel’s richer peripeteia, at once adventure, turning point, and discovery, but the episode is not just a way station on the long, stately procession of the
                  Recherchetoward the ultimate enunciation of an aesthetic in which the delectation of private sensations is made to carry a whole ontology.¹ It is rather a crucible in which the Proustian conception of truth is woven as a tangled knot of competing demands, unresolved contradictions, and unanswered questions. If we try to disentangle the knot, we can pick out three major threads,<br>

  Author(s) Cybulski Jacob<br>
  Abstract: Although there are several reports of information systems projects that have applied hermeneutics (Boland, 1991; Klein and Myers, 1999; Myers, 1994a), there are very few publications that explain the actual hermeneutic process taken by IS (and in fact, also non-IS) researchers.

  Author(s) Metcalfe Mike<br>
  Abstract: Centralised governance of effective knowledge sharing is very difficult in times of rapid change, especially for purposeful, information rich, socio-technical wicked systems. The lines of communication quickly become clogged, leaders suffer information overload and are unable to fully appreciate problems at the local level. Decentralisation of knowledge sharing runs the risk of causing local overload, with key information not being prioritised or depending on actors who only have experience at processing local problems. Alternatives such as ʹmiddle-outʹ (Keen, 1999) have been suggested, where strategically informed middle level actors play a coordination role between the top and bottom level actors. This<br>

  Author(s) Indulska Marta<br>
  Abstract: As techniques for conceptual modelling, enterprise modelling, and business process modelling have proliferated over the years (e.g. Olle et al., 1991), researchers and practitioners alike have attempted to determine objective bases on which to compare, evaluate, and determine when to use these different techniques (e.g. Karam and Casselman, 1993; Gorla et al., 1995) . However, throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and into the new millennium, it has become increasingly apparent to many researchers that without a theoretical foundation on which to base the specification for these various modelling techniques, incomplete evaluative frameworks of factors, features, and facets will continue to proliferate.<br>

  Abstract: The material in this chapter arises out of some practical experiences of the way the Australian state has negotiated claims for the protection of Indigenous ′sacred′ places that were threatened by private or public claims to exploit or remake the landscape in pursuit of wealth or public safety or amenity. For many readers this topic will bring to mind the unhappy experience of the Hindmarsh Bridge affair, where such a conflict dragged out through inquiries and litigation over some seven years and left behind bitter recrimination about the genuineness of Indigenous claims, the appropriateness of processes for evaluating them, and<br>

  Author(s): REUTER THOMAS<br>
  Abstract: This collection of papers is the fifth in a series of volumes on the work of the Comparative Austronesian Project. Reflecting the unique experience of fourteen ethnographers in as many different societies, the papers in this volume explore how people in the Austronesian-speaking societies of the Asia-Pacific have traditionally constructed their relationship to land and specific territories. Focused on the nexus of local and global processes, the volume offers fresh perspectives to current debate in social theory on the conflicting human tendencies of mobility and emplacement.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbjn5">Sharing the Earth, Dividing the Land</a><br>

  Abstract: The central highlands and some coastal areas of Bali are home to a little-known indigenous minority group, the

These regional, spatially bounded and historically conceived networks are known as banua. The banua and its constituent desa form a sacred landscape inscribed by the memory of a continuous history of human settlement and migration, and re-inscribed through origin narratives and ritual performances at sacred sites of origin, which are marked by shrines or temples.

  Abstract: The Banda Islands in central Maluku have long been a site of historical transformations. As a consequence, human relationships to land and place in the Bandas need to be understood in terms of dynamic processes of culture and history. In the pre-colonial period, the islands formed a key part of extensive trading networks reaching across the archipelago to link Maluku with the northern seaports of Java, the cosmopolitan city-state of Malacca in peninsular Malaysia, and ultimately to the Middle East, China and Europe. By the arrival of the first Europeans, the population of the islands included numbers of resident Malay<br>

  Abstract: This paper seeks to explore the nexus between language, space and identity.¹ It does so by focusing on the frequent use of orientational or deictic words in Buli language and relating it to the processes of identification.

  Author(s) Bellwood Peter<br>
  Abstract: Is it possible to correlate the earliest colonizing movements of Austronesian-speaking peoples into Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the myriad islands of Oceania² with the existence of a hereditary élite stratum of society? How far back in time can such élites be traced and can their genesis be related in any way to the colonization process itself? And how were the social systems of the earliest Austronesian groups, especially in Melanesia, affected by contact with pre-existing societies, perhaps similar in terms of economy and technology but fundamentally different in terms of social ideology?<br>

  Abstract: The process most often invoked in describing the hallmark of the Axial Age—or, to circumvent tricky problems of timing and synchronicity, of the Axial cultures—is the “discovery of transcendence.” “Transcendence,” however, covers a wide range of meanings. When applied to the distinction between our cognitive grasp of the world and its internal structure, for example, it denotes an epistemological conviction that is entirely neutral with regard to religious truth claims. The Axial Age debate emphasizes another aspect: it takes the religions and philosophical worldviews developed in the Axial cultures to be focused on a transcendent realm, a divine<br>

  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts. Global in nature, these "culture wars" exacerbate the tensions between tradition and innovation, virtue and freedom. Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

  Abstract: As the saying goes: the center does not hold. If one were to highlight a central feature of the modern age, one could plausibly point to its centrifugal momentum, its tendency toward fragmentation. In the intellectual domain, the tendency is patently evident in the process of specialization, the relentless segregation of fields of knowledge. However, the trend exceeds the knowledge domain. Together with other thinkers of his time, the philosopher Hegel saw modernity marked by radical “diremptions” or divisions (
                  Entzweiungen)—divisions between knowledge and action, thinking and feeling, private self-interest and the common good—with the prospects of reconciliation growing<br>

  Abstract: “Mobilizing democracy” is a stirring catchphrase, and it was a well-chosen theme for the 2005 meeting of one of the largest social science associations in the United States.¹ In choosing that theme, the organizers obviously wanted to establish a broad agenda, both nationally and globally. In fact, although couched as an ongoing process, the motto can readily be translated into a directive or even an imperative that postulates “mobilize democracy” or “spread democracy everywhere” or simply “democratize the world.” The directive is stirring and captivating—but also disorienting, given the serious malaise afflicting contemporary democracy both at home and abroad.<br>

The judicious use of the subjective camera is an especially effective technique when appropriately modified to evoke alien perspectives, those radically unlike our own.

While this is obvious, it offers a challenge to the one who would engage in a process of retrieval. A worthy process of retrieval demands that the classic element be dealt with in as balanced a manner as possible, without giving up the integrity of the process by highlighting only those aspects of the classic element that one either endorses or reviles.

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

  Abstract: For years, observers have identified a so-called memory boom among scholars and in many societies worldwide—a boom that the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have only intensified.¹ In some countries the memory of traumatic events is still raw, and processes of settling accounts linger in the current political agenda. Elsewhere, where the seminal events on which collective memories rest are further in the past, the issues involve debating and institutionalizing an appropriate culture of memory and collective identity for future generations. Sometimes the individual and collective wounds fester, waiting for necessary healing through political and judicial processes. Other times<br>

  Abstract: PLACES, LIKE PEOPLE, have reputations, and these reputations are created through relations in narrative—relations among places, the kinds of people who inhabit them, and the kinds of things that are said to occur there. Narratives are oriented not just temporally, but spatiotemporally; many narratives use places strategically, not only as a backdrop for events but also as a means for asserting some connections and negating others. As De Fina (2003) and others have noted, we need to understand orientation as a process ongoing throughout a narrative. And as we argue here, the strategic use of orientation can be crucial<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt629">Telling Stories</a><br>

However, life stories can also go awry. This calls for revisions of assumptions such as continuity.

  Abstract: THE TWO TERMS in the title of this chapter, “truth” and “authorship,” have long been central topics in narrative research. They remain ineludible because they are not only core elements of narrativity but also raise key questions about the roles of narrative in social life. The chapter seeks to show how truth and authorship are shaped by the path taken by witnesses’ depositions within the institutional meanders of the justice system. It does so by focusing on the multilateral character of storytelling in institutions and the complex processes of entextualization, decontextualization, and recontextualization.<br>

  Book Title: Ethics in Light of Childhood-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall John<br>
  Abstract: Childhood faces humanity with its own deepest and most perplexing questions. An ethics that truly includes the world's childhoods would transcend pre-modern traditional communities and modern rational autonomy with a postmodern aim of growing responsibility. It would understand human relations in a poetic rather than universalistic sense as openly and interdependently creative. As a consequence, it would produce new understandings of moral being, time, and otherness, as well as of religion, rights, narrative, families, obligation, and power.
      Ethics in Light of Childhoodfundamentally reimagines ethical thought and practice in light of the experiences of the third of humanity who are children. Much like humanism, feminism, womanism, and environmentalism, Wall argues, a new childism is required that transforms moral thinking, relations, and societies in fundamental ways. Wall explores childhood's varied impacts on ethical thinking throughout history, advances the emerging interdisciplinary field of childhood studies, and reexamines basic assumptions in contemporary moral theory and practice. In the process, he does not just apply ethics to childhood but applies childhood to ethics-in order to imagine a more expansive humanity.<br>

  Abstract: Bridge concepts aim to provoke accounts of widely separated figures in terms of a common set of topics that highlight particular points of similarity and difference. By creating more precise points of contact, the comparativist can provide the basis for an imaginary dialogue between the two positions thus articulated and thereby pursue more substantive investigations of the general topic the bridge concept specifies. Thus a bridge concept like “human nature” can serve to generate what might be called a

  Abstract: This book explores the strong presence of West African drumming and dance at North American universities, an ongoing process since 1964 that I describe as a resurrection. To offer a better understanding and appreciation of the reasons for calling West African drumming in the American academy a novelty, presence, and resurrection of a genre, it is crucial to situate this discussion by first evoking the broader a priori historical context that characterized the absence, disruption, and suppression of a symbolic musical tradition. Accordingly, I subsume this chapter under two historical phases: (1) Slavery (1619–1863), and (2) After Slavery until<br>

All traditions are vulnerable to betrayal for, in the very process of handing on, the original gift may be distorted or even lost. Different traditions no doubt develop different strategies for minimizing the element of betrayal, often centering on the authority to interpret, but these strategies themselves bear witness to the impossibility of reducing the risk of betrayal to zero. Yet the theme of betrayal remains itself ambiguous, for while the guardians or recipients<br>

  Author(s) Ramadan Tariq<br>
  Abstract: The work of categorization left by scholars through the ages is phenomenal. Specialists in the foundations of law and jurisprudence (
                  usul al-fiqh), who labored at this exercise of extrapolating and categorizing rules on the basis of a reading that was both careful to be faithful to the norm and profoundly rational, have bequeathed to us an unparalleled heritage. A careful reading of these works reveals that very precise modes of grasping the sources were set down very early. Consideration of the language was supported by a double process of distinguishing on the one hand between the unequivocal and the equivocal<br>

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

  Book Title: Genuine Multiculturalism-The Tragedy and Comedy of Diversity<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): FOSTER CECIL<br>
  Abstract: While many modern societies are noted for their diversity, the resulting challenge is to determine how citizens from different backgrounds and cultures can see themselves and each other as equals, and be treated equally. In Genuine Multiculturalism, Cecil Foster shows that a society's failure to bridge these differences is the tragedy of modern living and that pretending it is possible to mechanically develop fraternity and solidarity among diverse groups is akin to seeking out comedy. Arguing that genuine multiculturalism is the search for social justice by individuals who have been trapped by ascribed identities or newcomers who have been shut out of perceived ethnic homelands, Foster details how this process, in essence, is the story of the Americas. Reconceptionalizing the terms of multiculturalism, he offers an intervention into Canada's claim that its definition and practice are based on recognizing equality of citizenship. Identifying genuine multiculturalism as an ongoing work in progress, rather than a tightly defined policy position, Foster challenges readers to imagine a greater and more harmonious ideal. A necessary theoretical reconsideration of diversity within society, Genuine Multiculturalism refocuses the debate about ideals and practices in modern societies.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bf4m">The Uncertain Sciences</a><br>
  Abstract: The natural sciences allow us to attain relatively certain understanding of, and predictive control and manipulative power over, natural processes — or so it is widely assumed. This view holds, assuredly among scientists, even in the face of postmodernism and the social constructionism of science. Many believe that the natural sciences may, and perhaps should, serve as a model for any attempt at comparable human sciences. Indeed, at the time of the Enlightenment it was widely held that nothing seriously stood in the way of the extension of scientific method to human matters, although there was disagreement over how to carry<br>

  VII  Hermeneutics in Dialogue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: If anything is universal in philosophical hermeneutics, it is probably the recognition of one’s own finitude, the consciousness that actual speech does not suffice to exhaust the inner conversation that impels us toward understanding. Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

  Abstract: An artist’s words are always to be taken cautiously. The finished work is often a stranger to, and sometimes very much at odds with what the artist felt, or wished to express when he began. At best the artist does what he can rather than what he wants to do. After the battle is over and the damage faced up to, the result may be surprisingly dull—but sometimes it is surprisingly interesting.

  Book Title: Pushkin's Historical Imagination-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Evdokimova Svetlana<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  five  Forging Russian History: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bn3t">Pushkin's Historical Imagination</a><br>
  Abstract: Pushkin’s fascination with the figure of Peter the Great and his epoch coincides with the increase of his interest in the historical fate of Russia and the nature of the historical process per se. According to Vladimir Dal’, Pushkin was so preoccupied with the image of Peter the Great that he sought to portray him both in fictional and non-fictional genres and considered this one of the main tasks of his life. Dal’ describes his conversation with Pushkin in 1832:<br>

  Abstract: Like most of his historical fictions,
                  Poltava(1828), Pushkin’s longest dramatic poem, not only represents Pushkin’s interpretation of the specific historical event but also is a statement on the nature of historical process. Written in a few days, this majestic tour de force of three cantos stands between the two other major Petrine narratives—The Blackamoor of Peter the GreatandThe Bronze Horseman—as a glaring and assertive hymn to Russian nationalism. Indeed, some critics interpret the poem as an unambiguous and almost blatant defense of Russian imperial power and as a categorical condemnation of any revolt that could<br>

  Abstract: It is a tenet of semiotic studies—and one to which I fully subscribe—that much of what we take to be natural is in fact cultural. Part of the critical enterprise of this discipline is a continual process of defamiliarization: the exposing of conventions, the discovering of codes that have become so ingrained we do not notice them but believe ourselves to behold through their transparency the real itself. Nowhere is this process more important or more powerful than in our perceptions of our own bodies. We think we know ourselves directly, but both the “we” that know and<br>

  2  Cognition and Consciousness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: Cognitive psychologists and neuropsychologists like Marcel (1983ab), Humphrey (1983), Baars (1988), Weiskrantz (1988), and Schacter (1989) now understand consciousness as a formal system or capacity involving the direction, choice, and synthesis of nonconscious processes. This movement, however, has also been answered with renewed versions of the traditional functionalist and behaviorist rejections of the study of consciousness as anything other than an incidental by-product of computational capacity (Dennett, 1991). Consciousness is seen as private and hence outside scientific scrutiny, confabulated and deluded in its pretended access to cognitive process, and ultimately nonfunctional. Such a rejection is in fact central to the<br>

  3  Consciousness as Emergent: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: There is a widespread agreement among those psychologists who see consciousness as a causal system in its own right that its qualitative features are somehow “emergent” from underlying neural processes. That said, however, all major questions remain. Is consciousness, in the sense of a primary or immediate sentience, only emergent at a particular level of central nervous system complexity, as most investigators certainly would agree for self-referential symbolic processes? If so, is primary awareness regionally localized? Or, with the artificial-intelligence (AI) community, would any computational system of sufficient “cross-reference” also perform the basic functions attributable to consciousness? On both views,<br>

                  psycheaion, in contrast to what I have termed the horizontal sensus communis. Just as psyche-aion was described in terms of the same processes of fluidic dynamics as the “thought of the heart,” it also seems entirely plausible from a contemporary cognitive perspective to understand the range of experiences emerging with deep meditation and psychedelic drugs as cross-modal synesthetic translations across the more abstract or formal stages of perceptual microgenesis.

  Abstract: We have been dealing with the cognitive processes that underlie experiences which we have variously termed higher states of consciousness, transpersonal experience, or presentational states. These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level. Presence-openness emerges into presentational symbolic cognition through the synesthetic translation of the<br>

  Abstract: Despite the extensive advances in psychotherapy research during the past quarter-century (Garfield and Bergin, 1994; Roth and Fonagy, 1996), there have been few systematic efforts to address questions about psychoanalysis as therapy. Psychotherapy research, as a distinct and largely independent discipline, not to be confused with the practice of psychotherapy, involves systematic and empirical studies of psychotherapy process and outcome. It has gradually moved from fledgling attempts at empirical investigation, through a period of attempts to approximate a model of then-current medical research, to an increasing focus on interactive, subjective, and humanistic aspects of study (Orlinsky and Russel, 1994).

  1  What Is Psychoanalysis? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: A first step in studying whether psychoanalysis is effective is to delimit the treatments that will be called psychoanalysis. Freud (1904) defined psychoanalysis as the 
                  interrelated methods of observation, a conceptual system, and a therapeutic procedure. But the details of this interrelation are unclear. What boundaries of technique and theory usefully set off psychoanalytic ideas and processes from other activities? How are various ways of thinking about psychoanalysis interrelated? The question of what activities and theory are legitimately called psychoanalytic pervades the history of the field, often resulting in discord (see, e.g., Freud, 1914b, 1924; Oberndorf, 1953; Roustang, 1976; Turkle,<br>

  Abstract: Readers of the earlier chapters in this section will be understandably disappointed that, despite the enormous efforts of investigators, systematic research seems to have addressed few questions that are germane to clinical psychoanalytic practice. Either the population studied is too different from the patients ordinarily taken into psychoanalysis, or the measures of outcome and process are too crude to answer the questions that most interest analysts. The analyst wishes for investigative methods that are closer to the methods customarily used in psychoanalysis, addressing issues that confront her in daily work. The follow-up methods first introduced by Arnold Pfeffer meet many<br>

  Abstract: In earlier sections of this book we outlined questions about the efficacy, outcomes, and processes of psychoanalysis and summarized the available research data pertinent to these questions. These data show that psychoanalysis is a helpful procedure for many patients. But they do not address a wide range of important issues that we would like to understand better—for example, how the relation of qualities of patients and analysts is reflected in outcome, the relation of psychoanalytic processes and outcome, and the deeper psychological effects of psychoanalysis. Furthermore, each of the systematic investigations we reviewed had technical difficulties. The central problem<br>

  14  Collecting Data About Psychoanalysis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: Systematic psychoanalytic research requires a body of data to investigate. Unfortunately, data about analyses adequate for research purposes are difficult to obtain, and much of the data that are available have been so transformed in the process of reduction that investigators cannot be sure of their meaning. The very fact that the data were collected may so affect the analytic process that the data do not adequately represent ordinary psychoanalytic work. Analysts who are willing to collect detailed data about their work may be highly atypical in other ways. Data that appear in published reports are usually chosen because they<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: In studying psychoanalytic processes or any other complex phenomenon, enough data must be collected to be meaningful, the data must be reduced to a tractable form without undue loss of significance, and the extent to which particular findings can be generalized must be described. Not only is the analytic process complex, but it varies from one analysis to another. It is therefore important that many detailed instances of psychoanalytic practice be available for close study. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the painstaking collection of information in chemistry, descriptive biology, geology, and many other fields led to the generalizations that<br>

  Abstract: Al-Nakba, or “the Catastrophe,” is what the Palestinians call the expulsion from their ancestral land in 1948, which created the problem of refugees and its corollary issue, al-‘Awda, the “battle for the return to Palestine.” As the moment of origin of the conflict, al-Nakba remains the most complex and the most emotionally charged of all the issues now being addressed by the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Conversely, and paradoxically, the period of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process that began with the signing of the Oslo Accords of September 13, 1993, was accompanied by a policy of separate living spaces for Israelis and Palestinians, initiated by Israel.

  Abstract: Consider statutes and judicial decisions, two of the most common legal artifacts. If one accepts that statutes are not enacted by legislatures and that judicial decisions are not made by courts with a view to applying to foreign legal cultures, then legal borrowing across legal cultures is the practice of interrupting intention, which is a form of epistemic violence.¹ Statutes and judicial decisions nonetheless regularly find themselves being imported across legal cultures—that is, across cultures and languages—in order to underwrite local reforming agendas.

  Abstract: As we have seen in Chapter One, narrative management exploiting power may frustrate narrativity, the process by which a reader constructs a story based upon expectations and textual cues. Such experience, in turn, might generate in the reader an expanded repertoire of semiotic practices pertaining to texts and world. We have also seen how highly resistant narrative such as Momaday’s 
                  House Made of Dawn might drive the reader’s effort to decode the work beyond the margins of the text to extratextual references. Momaday’s is a useful technique for transforming the actual reader as thoroughly as possible into a projected, biculturally<br>

  Abstract: Contemporary fiction by Native Americans frequently traces crises of self-transformation.² Unique complications in the transformational process arise for Indian characters, sometimes on account of their half-blood or mixed-blood status, sometimes owing to their efforts to sustain tribal values in a white world, and other times due to their attempts to live by the rules of the dominant society. In the end, such characters usually shape themselves less according to traditional models drawn exclusively from a particular culture than to models that they half-invent and half-discover through bicultural experience. Thus, in their patterns of character development, American Indian narratives emphasize flexibility<br>

Rather, the study illuminates how incremental changes leading to larger paradigm shifts take place discursively and in relation to the marketplace, indicated by subtle transformations of both speech genres and larger conceptual categories.<br>

  Abstract: The detective novel is often analyzed in terms of its metafictional and metaphysical appeal. Whether consciously or unconsciously, the genre comments upon the process of sifting through signs, and ultimately upon the possibility of deriving order from the seeming chaos of conflicting signals and motives. The unraveling work of the detective within the story mirrors and assists the work of the reader, as both try to piece together the disparate signs that might eventually solve the mystery. The reader of the detective novel comes, metafictionally, to identify with the detective, because both reader and detective are bound up in the<br>

  Abstract: As an art working with time and addressing the ear, music, like poetry, requires and challenges memory. As early as the fourth century, Augustine used the example of music to illustrate his meditations on time and memory, describing the process of understanding a melody that unfolds in time,¹ and Edmund Husserl, in his

  Abstract: Many authors have noticed the symbolic deficit that affects the European institutions. European citizens do not feel attached to them. For some this is the inevitable result of a process of integration that is the spill-over effect of economic integration, while for others it is the consequence of the quasisupranational character of the European Union. The current European context is a very interesting case for the study of memory building, both because it is characterized by a complex process of pooling and sharing of sovereignty between nation-states and supranational institutions and because it is a process

  Abstract: Old cassette mix tapes tend to bring back memories. There is something accidental about this ability, because evoking memories was not their intended purpose. In the digital age, however, it is their evocative quality that they are mostly appreciated for. Besides conjuring up a wealth of autobiographical memories related to a specific tape, mix tapes naturally trigger memories of the outdated technology of the cassette recorder and of spending many an hour mixing tapes. Unlike making a playlist, mix taping involves a lot of work. As songs were generally rerecorded in real time, the process of making a mix tape<br>

  Book Title: Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe-  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Góis Pedro<br>
  Abstract: Globalisation, migration and integration have shaken up identity processes and identity dynamics as never before. But in a post-colonial, multi-ethnic Europe, what is identity? How is it constructed? Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe endeavours to answer these questions and more. Eleven of the thirteen chapters present empirical case studies from the Basque Country, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Portugal - thus resulting in one of the first international volumes to highlight Portugal's diverse and complex migration flows. Transnationalism also takes centre stage in several contributions that survey various types of informal and formal networks in local communities and across national borders. Via American studies, anthropology, cultural studies, ethnology, history, social psychology and sociology, the authors come from an array of disciplines as dynamic as the continent about which they write. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  1  Identity and inter-ethnic relations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46mvd1">Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Westin Charles<br>
  Abstract: This volume is about inter-ethnic relations in Europe with special emphasis on identity dynamics and identity processes. Here the concept of inter-ethnic relations comprises a broad range of encounters, between people and groups of diverse origins, taking place in contemporary societies. Much of the literature emphasises the problematic dimensions of these relations, pertaining to various aspects of social exclusion – racism, discrimination, segregation, xenophobia, ethnocentrism, inequality and injustice. However, inter-ethnic relations should also be understood to encompass processes of social inclusion, referred to under various headings such as incorporation, insertion, acculturation, assimilation, integration and even absorption. In other words, inter-ethnic<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46mvd1">Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: The preference for an anthropological reflection upon identity processes as a means to overcome the micro-macro dichotomy that has hampered the development of the social sciences (Calhoun 1996) immediately faces a number of obstacles. A strategy of total subjective and relative social research, reduced to micro-dimensions (limited to the construction of the self and interaction), may impede an analysis of the relationships between socio-historical groups. Similarly, a strategy of conceptual and theoretical babelisation of the concept of identity (and its derivatives) may lead to the loss of its analytical function in understanding historical dynamics.<br>

  Author(s) Góis Pedro<br>
  Abstract: Emigration was an economic strategy for Cape Verdeans from as early as the eighteenth century. It has become an important element of Cape Verdean social identity or, as this identity also has been called, Cape Verdeanness. In a situation where there are more Cape Verdean emigrants and their descendants outside Cape Verde than living within the archipelago itself,¹ traditional theories of migration and/or national identity placing more importance on origin than on all other features in the process of identity construction seem misplaced.<br>

  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: In two texts written 50 years apart, Erikson (1972: 274) and Bauman (2003) both attribute the relatively recent preoccupation with identity processes to the great economic and social transformations which destroyed community life, made subjects and families culturally vulnerable and created mounting internal and international migratory fluxes which temporarily increased tolerance to uncertainties (Appadurai 1998). Erikson developed his cluster of identity concepts within a relatively closed community, based on intergenerational recognition, and characterised by an antagonistic exteriority that conveniently sanctioned its relative closure. On the other hand, Bauman (2003: 16) theorises on community fixation, in line with Fromm (1941), less<br>

  Author(s) Guido Laurent<br>
  Abstract: At the turn of the 20th century, cinema emerged in a context marked by the vast expansion of interest in bodily movement, at the crossroads of aesthetic and scientific preoccupations. Already developed by Enlightenment philosophers and Romantic poets, the quest for the origins of nonverbal language and mime permeated the discussion of disciplines such as psychology or anthropology,¹ which were in the process of being institutionalized. Furthermore, new images of the body were created and distributed via experimental sciences, which considered the mechanism of physical movement as stemming from circulation and energy consumption. Therefore, the 1882 founding of the Station<br>

  Abstract: “Life imitates the movies” is a phrase that nowadays only raises eyebrows because it is so clichéd. But one of the conclusions one can draw from this truism is that if we are in some sense already “in” the cinema with what we can say “about” it, then the cinema needs a
                     theorythat can account for the historical processes that put us “inside,” and ahistorythat takes account of the ontological anxieties to which this interchangeability of inside and outside gives rise.<br>

  Abstract: It was Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten’s
                  Aesthetica(1750), which gave the new discipline of aesthetics its name. Aesthetics was concerned with a special faculty of perception that Baumgarten titled “sensuous knowledge” (cognitio sensitiva). In contrast to clear and distinct conceptual knowledge, sensuous knowledge is acognitio confusa, a confused knowledge form. “It is not aimed at distinctions; it pursues an animated intertwinement of aspects even when it is a matter of a stationary object. It lingers at a process of appearing,” Martin Seel remarks.¹ These processes of aesthetic appearing involve compounds of sensation or what I will call figures of sensation.<br>

  Abstract: The popular defense of processing children under eighteen in the adult criminal justice system instead of the juvenile justice system turns on the nature of the offense: children who commit adult crimes should do adult time. This position highlights the ways in which American cultural constructions of the child are not exclusively child based. That is to say, adult constructions of the child often do not correspond to what children themselves say and do. Paradoxically, children can lose their child status when they do not act

  Book Title: Poetry as Survival-  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

  Abstract: If bioregionalism is viewed narrowly, with a bioregion seen as a distinct natural region or a local place touted for its specialities, the feral may function as an unwelcome or invasive intrusion. In this narrow view, the energy of the local is focused on expelling, demonizing, marginalizing, and even destroying the feral. Generally, the feral can be understood as a state that lies somewhere between domesticated and wild. Ferality is implicitly accepted as a natural process: what happens when a domestic escapes, is released, or is transported into another bioregion; or conversely, what happens when the wild thing shifts or<br>

  Abstract: Ethnographies always begin as conversations between anthropologists and our hosts, who are, in turn, in conversation with each other. If we are fortunate, some of these conversations take unexpected turns, develop into genuine dialogues, and continue over many years. Dialogues open the possibility that we may learn something about the process of communication, about how words can be used to construct meaningful accounts of life experience. In this way, they differ fundamentally from structured interviews, where one of the participants claims rights both to pose the questions and interpret the responses.<br>

  Book Title: The Sacredness of the Person-A New Genealogy of Human Rights<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: According to Joas, every single human being has increasingly been viewed as sacred. He discusses the abolition of torture and slavery, once common practice in the pre-18th century west, as two milestones in modern human history. The author concludes by portraying the emergence of the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 as a successful process of value generalization. Joas demonstrates that the history of human rights cannot adequately be described as a history of ideas or as legal history, but as a complex transformation in which diverse cultural traditions had to be articulated, legally codified, and assimilated into practices of everyday life. The sacralization of the person and universal human rights will only be secure in the future, warns Joas, through continued support by institutions and society, vigorous discourse in their defense, and their incarnation in everyday life and practice.<br>

  Abstract: The first step in developing my argument was to examine in detail the emergence of the first human rights declarations in the late eighteenth century. I suggested that while we must understand these declarations as concretely as possible in light of their highly contingent contexts of emergence, we will do justice to them only if we also grasp them as expressions of deeper processes of cultural transformation. But how can we adequately conceptualize these processes? It is by no means self-evident that the answer is to refer to the “sacralization of the person” as I propose.¹<br>

  Abstract: The key thesis underlying the three historical-sociological discussions presented in this book is that we should understand the rise of human rights and the idea of universal human dignity as a process of the sacralization of the person. Inherent in this thesis is a rejection of all notions that this rise can be regarded as the product of a particular tradition, such as the Christian—a product that was more or less bound to emerge from the seed of tradition at some point in history. Traditions as such, I suggest, generate nothing. What matters is how they are appropriated by<br>

  Abstract: So far in my attempt to construct an affirmative genealogy of human rights I have placed great emphasis on the importance of subjective certainty, the sense of self-evidence and affective intensity of the kind characteristic of the sacred. I have portrayed the genesis and development of human rights as a history of the relocating of such self-evidence, a process that straddles the spheres of practices, values, and institutions. So experiences are an important driving force in this history—everyday experiences, but above all experiences that transcend the everyday, that fill actors with enthusiasm or affect them profoundly as their horror<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

It is vital in some because of the life and death decisions that must be made, for example, in medicine.

Third, case studies show how a diagnosis affects a patient's treatment in both clinical and familial settings. Finally, the collection highlights the gap that separates current biological understandings of aging from its cultural meanings.<br>

  Book Title: The King James Version at 400-Assessing Its Genius as Bible Translation and Its Literary Influence<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Towner Philip H.<br>
  Abstract: In this collection of essays, thirty scholars from diverse disciplines offer their unique perspectives on the genius of the King James Version, a translation whose 400th anniversary was recently celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. While avoiding nostalgia and hagiography, each author clearly appreciates the monumental, formative role the KJV has had on religious and civil life on both sides of the Atlantic (and beyond) as well as on the English language itself. In part 1 the essayists look at the KJV in its historical contexts—the politics and rapid language growth of the era, the emerging printing and travel industries, and the way women are depicted in the text (and later feminist responses to such depictions). Part 2 takes a closer look at the KJV as a translation and the powerful precedents it set for all translations to follow, with the essayists exploring the translators’ principles and processes (with close examinations of “Bancroft’s Rules" and the Prefaces), assessing later revisions of the text, and reviewing the translation’s influence on the English language, textual criticism, and the practice of translation in Jewish and Chinese contexts. Part 3 looks at the various ways the KJV has impacted the English language and literature, the practice of religion (including within the African American and Eastern Orthodox churches), and the broader culture. The contributors are Robert Alter, C. Clifton Black, David G. Burke, Richard A. Burridge, David J. A. Clines, Simon Crisp, David J. Davis, James D. G. Dunn, Lori Anne Ferrell, Leonard J.

  Abstract: “The Bible only,” the English churchman William Chillingworth wrote in 1638, “is the religion of Protestants.” Whether it was also the religion of England’s Protestant church is the question that prompts this essay. It is a question rarely asked. A number of recent books, shrewdly timed to take advantage of the 400th anniversary of the so-called King James Bible, have focused our attention onto that enterprise of 1611 and the processes, political and scholarly, that allowed other early modern Bibles to be rendered into English. We are now well educated in the Bible’s literary influence, reception, and modes of translation.<br>

  Abstract: Referring to tragic stories, Exum (1992, 8) argues that “the association of good and evil within the divine provides fertile ground for tragic awareness to grow.” According to Exum, “telling” and “re-telling” a biblical tragic narrative also makes one knowledgeable and “honest about reality.” The process creates openness to “a multivalent, inexhaustible narrative world” of good and evil. In a dialogical theological conversation, it instills a “tragic vision” that contributes to a “fullness of insight into the human condition” (1992, 9). This essay assumes that tensions between loyalties and disloyalties (re)produce the good and the evil, that which upholds and<br>

  Book Title: Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory-Collected Essays of Werner H. Kelber<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelber Werner H.<br>
  Abstract: Jesus and his followers defined their allegiances and expressed their identities in a communications culture that manifested itself in voice and chirographic practices, in oral-scribal interfaces, and in performative activities rooted in memory. In the sixteen essays gathered in Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory, Werner Kelber explores the verbal arts of early Christian word processing operative in a media world that was separated by two millennia from our contemporary media history. The title articulates the fact that the ancient culture of voiced texts, hand-copying, and remembering is chiefly accessible to us in print format and predominantly assimilated from print perspectives. The oral-scribal-memorial-performative paradigm developed in these essays challenges the reigning historical-critical model in biblical scholarship. Notions of tradition, the fixation on the single original saying, the dominant methodology of form criticism, and the heroic labors of the Quest—stalwart features of the historical, documentary paradigm—are all subject to a critical review. A number of essays reach beyond New Testament texts, ranging from the pre-Socratic Gorgias through medieval manuscript culture on to print’s triumphant apotheosis in Gutenberg’s Vulgate, product of the high tech of the fifteenth century, all the way to conflicting commemorations of Auschwitz—taking tentative steps toward a history of media technologies, culture, and cognition of the Christian tradition in the West.<br>

  Book Title: Political Creativity-Reconfiguring Institutional Order and Change<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Hattam Victoria<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on the rich cache of antidualist theoretical traditions, from poststructuralism and ecological theory to constructivism and pragmatism, a diverse group of scholars probes acts of social innovation in many locations: land boards in Botswana, Russian labor relations, international statistics, global supply chains, Islamic economics in Algeria, Islamic sects and state authority in Senegal, and civil rights reform, colonization, industrial policy, and political consulting in the United States. These political scientists reconceptualize
         agencyas a relational process that continually reorders the nature and meaning of people and things,orderas an assemblage that necessitates creative tinkering and interpretation, andchangeas the unruly politics of time that confounds the conventional ordering of past, present, and future.Political Creativityoffers analytical tools for reimagining order and change as entangled processes.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Galvan Dennis C.<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, we argue that the origins of both institutional order and change lie in human creativity. In a previous article, we looked at institutions from the inside out.¹ From that perspective, we showed how people experience institutional rules as bundles of resources available for creative reinterpretation and recombination. We called this process “creative syncretism” and conjectured that it produced institutional order and change simultaneously. In this work, we unpack creative syncretism by conceptualizing the interplay among creative projects undertaken by the powerful and the weak in the name of both seat-of-the-pants problem solving and grand institutional engineering.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Voskamp Ulrich<br>
  Abstract: For most of its post-1992 rapid industrialization, Chinese manufacturing excelled in global markets as a platform for high-volume and low-cost, export-oriented production.¹ Since China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, however, the fruits of rapid industrialization have been creating home market conditions for very different manufacturing strategies. Successful export-led industrialization has created more sophisticated domestic Chinese demand for a broad array of manufactured goods. In an effort to capture this emergent demand, Chinese producers are shifting their focus toward more advanced production and away from what was traditionally needed (or possible) within the framework of export processing relationships.<br>

  Author(s) Onoma Ato Kwamena<br>
  Abstract: “If this is all about creativity, how do you account for continuity and order?” This is a question that scholars who emphasize the role of creativity, agency, and ambiguity in the study of institutions often face. This question arises because these scholars, as well as their critics, who focus more on positive feedbacks and path dependence, often associate creativity, agency, and institutional ambiguity and incompleteness only with processes of institutional change. Continuity and stability are still too often seen as the result of the mechanistic functioning of self-reinforcing institutions.

  Abstract: THIS BOOK is intended for the practicing social scientist or social science student. It is concerned with actual research, and focuses on three main questions: (1) What are the actual goals of the various current research methods? Call the goals “truth” or “knowledge”; then what characteristics does achieved truth have in the various methods? (2) What social, cognitive, and personality processes occur or should occur during research, and how do they contribute to the outcome? (3) What persistent weaknesses and dangers appear in research, and what can we do about them?<br>

  Abstract: PRAGMATISTS TREAT SCIENCE as a process of inquiry or search for truth. The emphasis is on process, method, correction, change, not definitive and permanent results. Inquiry begins with a question or a problem, and is directed to answering the question or solving the problem. Problems are initially practical ones: How can we resolve or tone down family quarrels? How can we reduce the inflation rate, or compensate for its more harmful effects without causing trouble elsewhere? However, the search for solutions brings up more abstract problems: What is a good measure of inflation? What is the relation between the quantity<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjq68">Dancing Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: A basic issue in dance is how to link human agency with movement form and expression. When we dance we embody agency through bodily orientation and consciousness. The dialectic nature of these links is played out daily in our movement choices and bodymind awareness. Judith Butler asks what kind of performances will destabilize received and rehearsed categories. The possibilities of transformation may be found in a “failure to repeat, a de-formity.”¹ Dance forms are repeated daily, hourly, in rehearsal rooms around the world. Thus a major question we should ask is, “What do we want to instill in this process,<br>

                     We are works in progress, in other words, and like works of art we live between content and process. Our living metaphysical reality does not mount to heaven, but spreads into our everyday dances—of auspicious being and indeterminate becoming.<br>

  Abstract: Sociocultural processes and artifacts are human
                     doings, expressions that extend from and also extend our bodily nature. Encompassing sex and gender, our performances include nature and are sown in word and deed. The body is a primal natural fact and also a sophisticated artifact, and if fact comes before “arti-fact,” both dissolve in metaphysics. Artifacts reflect the nebulous material of beings-in-the-world that shaped them. Dancing brings this to us, but in a slippery way.<br>

  Abstract: Because he was teaching at the University of Pittsburgh at the time, Paul Kameen was a part of the academic milieu surrounding Richard Young’s NEH seminar at Carnegie Mellon University in 1978. William Coles and Otis Walter, also from the University of Pittsburgh, were guests at the seminar, and Kameen was very much aware of their work regarding the composing process and rhetorical invention. Like James Berlin, Kameen was wary of the dubious connection between Coleridge and the characterization of vitalism that Young was putting forward in the seminar. Kameen also published a key article in 1980 that put forward<br>

  4  A Short Counter-History from:

  Abstract: Rather than place Coleridge in the narrative of rhetoric’s retreat and return, either in retreat as Richard Young does or in return as James Berlin does, Paul Kameen’s reading seems to place Coleridge elsewhere. Certainly Kameen is interested in the ways Coleridge can expand the field’s conceptions of rhetorical invention and the composing process, but his rearticulation of Coleridge goes beyond the revaluation of the romantic individual. If Coleridge is read as espousing a complex relationship among the world, the body, the mind, and writing, then his importance clearly goes beyond mystical genius. But simply placing Coleridge into the return<br>

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

  15  Does Europe Have a Cultural Identity? from:

  Author(s) Wagner Peter<br>
  Abstract: In 1870, once the process of Italian unification had been completed with the creation of a nation-state after several years of conflict (including armed conflict), in much the same way as in Germany, one of the protagonists stated: ‘Now that we’ve created Italy, we have to create the Italians’ (this remark is attributed, perhaps wrongly, to Massimo d’Azeglio). Despite his efforts to fuse the territories of the peninsula together into a single political order, d’Azeglio did

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjcgf">Ciaran Carson</a><br>
  Abstract: Translation is a longstanding and recurrent component of Ciaran Carson’s work, not only as practice, process, and artefact – as his recent book-length versions of Dante’s
                  Inferno, Brian Merriman’sThe Midnight Court, and the Old Irish epic,The Táin, attest – but also as a theme or trope that relates to the multifarious effects of language itself. In this regard ‘translation’ concerns itself with the ways in which transactions between words, idioms, discourses, and languages reveal the difference that is internal to all language. Or, as Walter Benjamin expresses it, ‘all translation is only a somewhat provisional way of coming to terms<br>

  Author(s) Woodhull Winifred<br>
  Abstract: Insofar as film scholarship followed literary studies, in the 1980s and 1990s, in taking up Benedict Anderson’s work on the construction of national identity through imagined communities, much attention has been devoted to looking at French films that participate in that process by construing colonized peoples as primitive and frequently feminized ‘Others’, in opposition to whom the French define themselves as rational, enlightened and civilized. Like the films themselves, the analyses vary in the degree to which they see colonizer/colonized relations in terms of stark binaries or in terms of ambiguous hybrid identities on both sides. Yet whatever the emphasis,<br>

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

  Author(s) WELLS STANLEY<br>
  Abstract: A Midsummer Night’s Dreamis profoundly and constantly—though also delicately and humorously—concerned with processes of change, of translation from one state to another, and its audience is frequently made aware that for human beings translation—any kind of translation—is likely to be a difficult process requiring that obstacles be overcome, and that it may involve loss as well as gain. The most prominent, and most frequently discussed, aspect of translation in the play is from the unmarried to the married state. In no other play by Shakespeare is the process of courtship leading to marriage so central<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjm19">London Irish Fictions</a><br>
  Abstract: The novels, short stories and auto/biographical texts I have examined in this book are written and peopled by men and women who, as well as making journeys from one country to another, have embarked upon narrative journeys of the mind. Unlike the geographical journey of migration, however, narrative is not a linear process. Instead, it possesses an inherent temporal elasticity that often enables writers to deploy inventive methods and modes of storytelling and characterization. Rather than simply providing a series of period snapshots, these texts reveal how identities are configured over time as well as space. In other words, they<br>

  Book Title: Thresholds of Meaning-Passage, Ritual and Liminality in Contemporary French Narrative<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUFFY JEAN H.<br>
  Abstract: Thresholds of Meaning examines contemporary French narrative and explores two related issues: the centrality within recent French fiction and autofiction of the themes of passage, ritual and liminality; and the thematic continuity which links this work with its literary ancestors of the 1960s and 1970s. Through the close analysis of novels and récits by Pierre Bergounioux, François Bon, Marie Darrieussecq, Hélène Lenoir, Laurent Mauvignier and Jean Rouaud, Duffy demonstrates the ways in which contemporary narrative, while capitalising on the formal lessons of the nouveau roman and drawing upon a shared repertoire of motifs and themes, engages with the complex processes by which meaning is produced in the referential world and, in particular, with the rituals and codes that social man brings into play in order to negotiate the various stages of the human life-cycle. By the application of concepts and models derived from ritual theory and from visual analysis, Thresholds of Meaning situates itself at the intersection of the developing field of literature and anthropology studies and research into word and image.<br>

  Abstract: Anything (material or nonmaterial) can be the object of our awareness, attention, or questioning mind. Whenever we ask “what is this?” we enter into an inquiring frame of mind. When we research something, we formalize this intuitive process to establish a definition for qualitative discourse or quantitative testing. We define the thing we seek to know more about. Then we have a basis for communicating the findings. The results of the research will rest on our basic understanding and definition of the thing we are investigating.

Some of these are narrow and restrictive, requiring a theory to be derived from quantifiable data and capable of being tested.

In order to perceive events in the outer world, it is held, the mind has to get into contact with matter. For this purpose it relies on a complex machinery (sense organs, nerves, central processing modules, etc.), and the working of that machinery yields results that may be more or less adequate representations of the events to be represented.<br>

  Abstract: Psychology, according to a standard dictionary definition, is the science of mind and behavior. For a major part of the twentieth century, (nonhuman) animal psychology was on a behavioristic track that explicitly denied the possibility of a science of animal mind. While many comparative psychologists remain wedded to behavioristic methods, they have more recently adopted a cognitive, information-processing approach that does not adhere to the strictures of stimulus-response explanations of animal behavior. Cognitive ethologists are typically willing to go much further than comparative psychologists by adopting folk-psychological terms to explain the behavior of nonhuman animals.<br>

  Abstract: Ernst Cassirer’s philosophy of culture steered philosophical thought in a new direction. In contrast to both the unmediated unity of being in traditional metaphysics and the epistemic unity of the transcendental subject in modern, critical philosophy, his theory of cultural symbols assumes the object of philosophical reflection to be irreducibly pluralist. His approach raises two fundamental questions. First, is the philosophy of symbolic forms a substitute for metaphysics or does it require a metaphysical foundation to remain consistent with its own principles? Second, how can it discuss contingent matters, such as the historical process of culture, without losing its philosophical<br>

  Abstract: Over the last two decades there has been an increasing tendency for artists to seek partnerships with academics and vice versa.¹ Exchange projects like artist-in-residency programmes at universities have become common practice and there are many organizations that initiate and actively promote collaboration between artists and academics.² To stimulate theoretical reflection on this development, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) launched in 2006 the CO-OPs programme. CO-OPs focused on the processes of knowledge production that take place when artists and academics work together on a common research question. On the one hand, it aimed at the formation of new<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Assimilation in the French sociology of incorporation from a multicultural perspective from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp7qd">Secularism, Assimilation and the Crisis of Multiculturalism</a><br>
  Abstract: Assimilation is a rather unfriendly concept when used in a social context. In French, it generally means an act of the mind that considers (something) as similar (to something else). A relevant secondary meaning is the action of making (something) similar (to something else) by integration or absorption. This meaning has existed in physiology since 1495. Around 1840, the concept was related to social processes for the first time, as the act of assimilating persons and peoples; the process through which these persons, these peoples, assimilate (themselves). This connotation incorporates terms like ‘Americanisation’ and ‘Frenchisation’. The older physiological connotation shines<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp7qd">Secularism, Assimilation and the Crisis of Multiculturalism</a><br>
  Abstract: The following chapters are founded on the idea that a critical rethinking of Jewish assimilation in 19th-century France – or the process which has been interpreted as such – is important for an assessment of the moral legitimacy and practical wisdom of (re)introducing liberal-assimilationist discourses and practices in the European context. Rethinking Jewish assimilation will also help us trace assimilation’s connections to secularisation in the France of the Third Republic. This will facilitate our understanding of the connections between secularism and assimilationism today. I try to contribute to such a rethinking of assimilation by scrutinising the ways in which assimilation’s practical and<br>

  Abstract: Cajal’s studies of the nervous system trace the limits of scientific realism. The workings of the cellular world obviously have global effects on the body, but the greater the detail of Cajal’s descriptions, the more difficult it becomes for him to explain human behavior in terms of cells. What is it about the branches of neurons that makes individuals think the way they do? Literary realism has similar limits. It may be obvious that environmental factors like alcoholism or poverty have dramatic effects on a person’s (and a character’s) identity, but the realist process of amassing minute observations is often<br>

This historical narrative arises from detailed rhetorical analysis of the themes and poetics that make up literary images of science. It finds its inspiration in the intellectual preoccupations of the period it encompasses. The irony implicit in a study of multifarious images is that its own imaging of real processes in nineteenth-and twentieth-century Spanish culture remains unavoidably incomplete.

  Abstract: In the last few decades, Germany and Austria have experienced a staggering expansion of the field of Jewish studies.¹ They have been set up either as separate institutes within a faculty or as programs that consist of courses related to Jewish history and culture offered by various departments. The development of Jewish studies is closely connected to political and cultural processes in society at large and cannot be described properly without taking them into account.

  Author(s) Bleiker Roland<br>
  Abstract: The argument for drawing upon non-Western cultural traditions of conflict resolution can be made in direct terms. Local traditions of conflict resolution have been neglected because prevailing ways of dealing with conflict are typically focused through Western approaches to conflict resolution. There is a clear need, then, particularly in the context of conflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts of recent decades, to expand our approaches through engagement with local processes and sources of insight. If one recognises this predicament, then a number of important questions immediately arise: Why have local traditions been neglected? Why should we draw on these traditions rather<br>

  Abstract: After almost a decade of war (1989–1998) and the bloodiest violent conflict in the South Pacific since the end of the Second World War, Bougainville has gone through a comprehensive peacebuilding process. This process is a rare success story in contemporary postconflict peacebuilding. Because the conflict occurred during a time of statelessness in Bougainville, space was opened for a renaissance of nonstate customary institutions and processes. In the absence of state institutions, local practices resumed their central role in the life of the communities. In many places elders and chiefs, assisted particularly by women and local church people, became<br>

  Abstract: Several centuries of interaction across ethnic and religious difference in the Indonesian archipelago have been accompanied by the evolution of local ways of resolving communal disputes and violence. We term the resulting norms and practices ‘local conflict resolution’. The development of these ways of mediating across difference has itself sometimes been violent, yet the accompanying local conflict resolution processes are dynamic and pluralist. They are open to revision and adaptation, including to the input of outside and new forces and actors. For this reason our use of the term ‘local’ does not connote a bounded space that excludes outsiders. Rather,<br>

Seika eventually renounced Buddhism and served various daimyō and wealthy merchants of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In the process, he met several Korean prisoners of war brought in by Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s troops returning from their attempts to conquer Ming dynasty China. With the instruction of these Koreans, and especially that of the scholar Kang Hang (1567–1618), Seika acquired a more secular understanding of Song and Ming neo-Confucian philosophy<br>

  Book Title: Relative Histories-Mediating History in Asian American Family Memoirs<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Rocío G.<br>
  Abstract: Relative Histories focuses on the Asian American memoir that specifically recounts the story of at least three generations of the same family. This form of auto/biography concentrates as much on other members of one’s family as on oneself, generally collapses the boundaries conventionally established between biography and autobiography, and in many cases—as Rocío G. Davis proposes for the auto/biographies of ethnic writers—crosses the frontier into history, promoting collective memory. Davis centers on how Asian American family memoirs expand the limits and function of life writing by reclaiming history and promoting community cohesion. She argues that identity is shaped by not only the stories we have been told, but also the stories we tell, making these narratives important examples of the ways we remember our family’s past and tell our community’s story. In the context of auto/biographical writing or filmmaking that explores specific ethnic experiences of diaspora, assimilation, and integration, this work considers two important aspects: These texts re-imagine the past by creating a work that exists both in history and as a historical document, making the creative process a form of re-enactment of the past itself. Each chapter centers on a thematic concern germane to the Asian American experience: the narrative of twentieth-century Asian wars and revolutions, which has become the subtext of a significant number of Asian American family memoirs (Pang-Mei Natasha Chang’s Bound Feet and Western Dress, May-lee and Winberg Chai’s The Girl from Purple Mountain, K. Connie Kang’s Home Was The Land of Morning Calm, Doung Van Mai Elliott’s The Sacred Willow); family experiences of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which unveil a history of multiple diasporas that are often elided after families immigrate to the United States (Helie Lee’s Still Life With Rice, Jael Silliman’s Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames, Mira Kamdar’s Motiba’s Tattoos); and the development of Chinatowns as family spaces (Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men, Lisa See’s On Gold Mountain, Bruce Edward Hall’s Tea that Burns). The final chapter analyzes the discursive possibilities of the filmed family memoir ("family portrait documentary"), examining Lise Yasui’s A Family Gathering, Ruth Ozeki Lounsbury’s Halving the Bones, and Ann Marie Fleming’s The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam. Davis concludes the work with a metaliterary engagement with the history of her own Asian diasporic family as she demonstrates the profound interconnection between forms of life writing.<br>

They came to be recognized as transcendents in the course of their multifaceted interactions with others, and, as a result of people’s responses to them, during and after their active presence in communities. Their reputations were formed by social and conversational processes that occurred mostly outside the texts that survive for us to read today.

  Book Title: Out of the Margins-The Rise of Chinese Vernacular Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Ge Liangyan<br>
  Abstract: The novel Water Margin (Shuihu zhuan), China's earliest full-length narrative in vernacular prose, first appeared in print in the sixteenth century. The tale of one hundred and eight bandit heroes evolved from a long oral tradition; in its novelized form, it played a pivotal role in the rise of Chinese vernacular fiction, which flourished during the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) periods. Liangyan Ge's multidimensional study considers the evolution of Water Margin and the rise of vernacular fiction against the background of the vernacularization of premodern Chinese literature as a whole. This gradual and arduous process, as the book convincingly shows, was driven by sustained contact and interaction between written culture and popular orality. Ge examines the stylistic and linguistic features of the novel against those of other works of early Chinese vernacular literature (stories, in particular), revealing an accretion of features typical of different historical periods and a prolonged and cumulative process of textualization. In addition to providing a meticulous philological study, his work offers a new reading of the novel that interprets some of its salient characteristics in terms of the interplay between audience, storytellers, and men of letters associated with popular orality.<br>

  Abstract: In both the West and the East, the relationship of writing to speech has a direct bearing on literature, especially narrative literature. Around the eighth century b.c., the Greeks adopted the writing shapes from the Phoenician syllabary and invented what is known to be the earliest alphabetic system. The advent of the Greek writing system marks the beginning of a new era of Western civilization, with written literature as one of the most immediate results. The Homeric epics, hitherto existing only orally, now became written, although there is no consensus how that was accomplished. The significance of this process has<br>

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

Moving beyond the highlands, to the larger world in which the Bali Aga engage in a process of mutual representation with more powerful others, this chapter and the following ones explore their place within Balinese society and discourses, and in the Western anthropological literature about this island.

Insofar as the Bali Aga have been portrayed with a negative bias by other, more powerful Balinese people, I assume that there is a moral responsibility to amplify their counterdiscourses. At the same time, Balinese identities are the product of a historical and intersubjective process in which the Bali Aga have participated with an ambivalent attitude of competition as well as cooperation. In adopting this perspective, I aim to prevent a fetishization<br>

  Abstract: In resonance with this epigraph,my goal here is to share knowledge and experience, not about the literate practices of African American women as in the previous chapters but about my own standpoint as a researcher and scholar in the process of completing this book. The first and most consistent challenges have come hand in hand with the very choosing of the work itself, that is, with identifying myself as a researcher who focuses on a multiply marginalized group; whose interests in this group center on topics not typically associated with the group, such as nonfiction and public discourse rather<br>

  Book Title: Interpretation-Ways of Thinking about the Sciences and the Arts<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolters Gereon<br>
  Abstract: The act of interpretation occurs in nearly every area of the arts and sciences. That ubiquity serves as the inspiration for the fourteen essays of this volume, covering many of the domains in which interpretive practices are found. Individual topics include: the general nature of interpretation and its forms; comparing and contrasting interpretation and hermeneutics; culture as interpretation seen through Hegel's aesthetics; interpreting philosophical texts; methodologies for interpreting human action; interpretation in medical practice focusing on manifestations as indicators of disease; the brain and its interpretative, structured, learning and storage processes; interpreting hybrid wines and cognitive preconceptions of novel objects; and the importance of sensory perception as means of interpreting in the case of dry German Rieslings.In an interesting turn, Nicholas Rescher writes on the interpretation of philosophical texts. Then Catherine Wilson and Andreas Blank explicate and critique Rescher's theories through analysis of the mill passage from Leibniz's

  Abstract: Training artificial networks to be selectively sensitive to typical kinds of temporal processes has proved to be relatively easy. But in biological creatures, the process of experience-dependent long-term adjustment of the brain’s synaptic connections is definitely not governed by the supervised back-propagation-of-errors technique widely used to train up the computer-modeled artificial networks familiar from the past two decades. That brute-force artificial technique requires that the “correct behavior” for a mature<br>

  8  ON MY OWN: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrjgw">Textual Intimacy</a><br>
  Abstract: Religious identity’s second facet is assumption as in consciously taking something on, like assuming the responsibilities of office upon being sworn in. Usually the second facet is a response to challenges that question or present alternatives to a religious identity that, heretofore, had simply been assumed. These challenges need not result in radical change, although, as we saw earlier in some of the self-accounts, they can. More often they produce a process of distancing, uncertainty, and reformulation.<br>

  Book Title: Doing Justice to Mercy-Religion, Law, and Criminal Justice<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Jung Kevin<br>
  Abstract: It is often assumed that the law and religion address different spheres of human life. Religion and ethics articulate complex systems of moral reasoning that concern norms, deliberation of ends, cultivation of disposition, and transformation of moral agency. Law, in contrast, seeks to govern human conduct through procedural justice, rights, and public good. Doing Justice to Mercy challenges this assumption by presenting the reader with an urgent conversation between the law and religion that yields a constructive approach, both theoretically and practically, to the complex role of mercy in our legal process.<br>

  Abstract: In the United States today, perhaps the consummate “outsiders” are the ones, as we say, “on the inside.” The people in many respects most peripheral in American social and political life are those who live incarcerated in prisons and jails, at once outcast to the public perimeter and corralled together in “correctional centers.” As political subjects, they are (1) among the most disenfranchised, exiled from the political processes by which state power is determined and carried out, and (2) among the most thoroughly determined by those processes and that power.

  Abstract: At odd intervals in the main galleries of the renovated Museum of Modern Art, there are textual supplements to paintings, rarely more than a paragraph, providing snippets of information about the artist, the context of the work’s production, or the place it holds in the narrative of modern art. What makes these random exceptions to the more frequent practice of labeling the artwork only by artist, title, and date so intriguing is that they seem to follow no obvious pattern that might justify the choices made by the curators to arrest the process of pure looking.

  Chapter Five  The Odd Triangle: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: From Augustine to our own era, introspection is inextricable from “self-consciousness,” which in turn is integral to and, in some sense, coincident with various understandings of selfhood. Simply, self-consciousness is enacted through self-reflexivity, and in this process of self-awareness, identity emerges. But the word “reflexivity” has a more circumscribed history. Reflexivity appears as a paradigm of understanding the self during the early modern period, coincident with the preoccupation with optics and the birth of a new physics of light. “Reflexivity” was first applied to cognitive introspection, in referring to “thought as bending back upon itself,” in the 1640s, when theologians,<br>

  9  NEW BEGINNINGS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rszr">The Sense of Music</a><br>
  Abstract: A musician, more than anyone else, ought to be aware of the need for faithfulness to one’s material. The philosophical mind seeks logi cal sequence and noncontradiction; but the best composers override logic in a desire to let their material work itself out unhindered. For this reason, Jacques Barzun identified Romanticism with realism, as I recorded above in Chapter 5. The process of stylization in Romantic art was aimed “not in the direction of a common norm, but in the direction of complete expressiveness. This is the desire to make each object disclose itself as fully as possible under the<br>

  Abstract: Electoral-representative democracy is based on the axiom that the general will is fully and directly expressed through the electoral process. The ballot is supposed to express the will of the voters, the voters are supposed to be the sole “subject” of politics, and the moment of the vote is supposed to determine the temporality of the political process. This conception of democracy rests on three basic assumptions: the voters’ choice is equated with the general will; the voters are equated with the people; and all subsequent political and legislative activity is assumed to flow continuously from the moment of the<br>

  Book Title: Slavery and the Culture of Taste-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gikandi Simon<br>
  Abstract: Gikandi focuses on the ways that the enslavement of Africans and the profits derived from this exploitation enabled the moment of taste in European--mainly British--life, leading to a transformation of bourgeois ideas regarding freedom and selfhood. He explores how these connections played out in the immense fortunes made in the West Indies sugar colonies, supporting the lavish lives of English barons and altering the ideals that defined middle-class subjects. Discussing how the ownership of slaves turned the American planter class into a new aristocracy, Gikandi engages with the slaves' own response to the strange interplay of modern notions of freedom and the realities of bondage, and he emphasizes the aesthetic and cultural processes developed by slaves to create spaces of freedom outside the regimen of enforced labor and truncated leisure.<br>

  Abstract: In a globalized world grown smaller by progressively dizzying flows of people, knowledge, and information, ʺtravelʺ seems to have become the image of the age. Porous borders, portable allegiances, virtual networks, and elastic identities now more than ever evoke the language of mobility, contingency, fluidity, provisionality, and process rather than that of stability, permanence, and fixity.¹ Scholars who traffic in the lingo of deterritorialization and nomadism increasingly traverse disciplines and regions, mining disparate experiences of displacement such as tourism, diaspora, exile, cyberculture, and migration as ʺcontact zones,ʺ sites that articulate the preconditions and implications of cross-cultural encounters.²<br>

In addition, the collapse of the Soviet Union initiated a process of political restructuring in Europe which has not perhaps yet reached its final stage.

                  notwish to recall. Sometimes if one is quick and nimble enough, one can even catch the process of “reconstructing” one’s past in memory on the hop, that is, one can recall the original impression and also the gradual way in which it began to fade, shift, and be transformed. Very occasionally, the original experience is so vivid, one cannot help thinking it is preserved in the mind in a form that excludes serious error or uncertainty<br>

  Abstract: By drawing primarily on historiographical scholarship in Quebec, I intend to present some views on the role of comparison as a process of objectification in building historical knowledge. In very general terms, comparison refers here to any scientific approach which consists in: (1) relating two or several objects of analysis belonging to as many collective settings and (2) foregrounding differences and similarities so as to increase knowledge either of one or of each of these objects. I return to this later. My ideas are intended as a vindication of comparative history; there are, however, several ways to broach the argument.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zszcb">The Making of the Nations and Cultures of the New World</a><br>
  Abstract: After Quebec, our attention turns to Mexico and Latin America (Map 1). Considering the continent’s diversity, it might appear surprising that this inquiry starts with Mexico and then spills into the whole of Latin America.¹ Yet, beyond their important distinguishing features, I believe that the collectivities of this continent shared dreams, problems, and historical experiences that legitimize my approach. Moreover, the act of recognizing elements of a common narrative can, in turn, shed light on particular trajectories. In describing the process whereby European immigrants appropriated these new spaces between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, I use the concept of “Americanization”<br>

  Abstract: As is well known, Darwin produced a large number of theories, many of which dealt explicitly with evolution or special aspects of it, and many others of which were closely related to problems in evolution, although the evolutionary aspect was only implicit. Furthermore, throughout his life Darwin varied the emphasis he placed on different processes and mechanisms, and, for some of them, he radically altered his position. In his published works, Darwin hardly ever indicated precisely how any single topic he discussed could or should be connected with other topics, in an overall interpretative framework of evolutionary phenomena.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv2nc">Poetics of Reading</a><br>
  Abstract: Reading is a complex process that gradually involves us, as we read, in multiple, interlocking “frames of reference.” I am borrowing the term from Nelson Goodman who, in
                  Ways of World-making, writes: “If I ask about the world, you can offer to tell me how it is under one or more frames of reference; but if I insist that you tell me how it is apart from all frames, what can you say? We are confined to ways of describing whatever is described. Our universe, so to speak, consists of these ways rather than of a world or of worlds.”¹<br>

Both novels include detailed descriptions of how their central characters read and respond to works of art. While the focus inMadame Bovaryis on negative versions of reading that warn us, through irony, about the dangers of misreading, Proust’s novel abounds in models of reading designed to show how the fictions of art and literature set in motion a process of reading that is creative, not destructive.

  Abstract: Uzbekistan, Eritrea, Moldavia, Slovakia, and East Timor are all new independent states on our world map, but they are by no means the only ones. In the 1990s, no less than twenty new states were created. Most of them emerged out of the ruins of the Soviet Empire, while others were the product of the resumption of a decolonization process interrupted by expansionist neighbours such as Ethiopia and Indonesia. This list, however, takes into account only the criteria of international recognition, which provide a partial and imperfect image of much broader nationalist claims.¹<br>

To quote a much-cited observation from the nationalist writer and former Piedmontese prime minister Massimo d’Azeglio, “Italy is made; now we must make Italians” (Seton-Watson 1967, 13).

  Abstract: In his renowned study of nationalism, Benedict Anderson begins by admitting that the subject matter of his book is notoriously hard to define. His interpretation is that a nation is
                  an imagined political community, one both inherently limited and sovereign. However, whereas Ernest Gellner said of nationalism that it is able to invent nations even where they do not exist, Anderson (1983, 6) asserts that the process of nation-creating is not so much one of false fabrication as it is one of active creation: in a sense there are no “true” communities that can be juxtaposed to “false,” or invented,<br>

  Abstract: In its heroic beginnings, secularization was an attempt to rescue the substance of religious truth from a moribund dogmatism that literalized god terms. To conceive of God, virtue, salvation, blessedness as symbolic terms was not to diminish the reality of the religious quest but to heighten it. In

  Abstract: While the plays that follow the tragedies and conclude Shakespeare’s career seem to belong to a different world from the tragedies, the differences do not eradicate some fundamental social continuities. The romances still observe Renaissance social decorum, bestowing the most serious roles on the social elite and depicting them in greater numbers than their inferiors, in defiance of Jacobean social reality. In contrast to the tragedies, redemptive symbols in the late plays are vindicated, and hard won self-knowledge is cherished by cosmic hope. Yet the spiritually ennobling process we witness in the romances is largely confined to the upper classes,<br>

Purposive ambiguity refers to a family of specific communicative devices: deliberate attempts to control audience reaction through the structure of discourse. More precisely, purposive ambiguity is that for which reference to a hypothetical intention has explanatory force. Circumstantial ambiguity amounts to a residual classification for ruptured communication, for, that is, an audience’s room to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvdgf">History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance</a><br>
  Abstract: The premise that historical writing was an instrument of cognition depended on abstract ideas about cognition. Those ideas concerned the process of coming to know, rather than particular things that were known. The difference in literary form between historical texts of the twelfth century and those of the fifteenth and later indicates a profound change, not only in style, but also, at a far deeper level, in the ways in which the conditions, possibilities, and limits of cognition were conceived.

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvf23">The Life of Roman Republicanism</a><br>
  Abstract: This book seeks to place Cicero’s
                  Verrines, Caesarian orations,Republic, andLaws; Sallust’sCatilineandJugurtha; and Horace’sSatiresat the center of the republican tradition. In the process, I aim to rewrite the orientation and concerns of that tradition in a different idiom than they are currently understood. I address these writings as the literary texts that they are, not as sources of isolated quotations, and for this reason I proceed through close individual readings. Though I approach each text knowing a good deal about its intended audience and the conditions under which its words were first set down,<br>

  3  NON-SOVEREIGN FREEDOM IN HORACEʹS SATIRES 1 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvf23">The Life of Roman Republicanism</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 1, I defended the claim that the republican conception of freedom is grounded in the understanding that politics is constituted in the fundamental antagonism between the haves and the have-nots. Chapter 2 turned to the the obstacles to justice as Sallust represents them: the vulnerability of the political process to greed and corruption; the dangerous failure of the senatorial order to recognize the poor and marginalized; and finally, the constraints on just judgment created by the irrepressible play of chance. I sought to point out, too, how Sallust exposes and works with the corporeal element in world-perception.<br>

  FIVE  Implications for Social Unity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvm0c">I Am You</a><br>
  Abstract: In previous chapters, it has become evident that, whether by amorous or malevolent sympathy, the empathetic identity of “I” and “you” did not exist from the start, except potentially. The dominant patterns of understanding required what was potential to be made actual by a process of transformation that narrowed the distance of relationship until it closed. Closure came through affective bonding in which love, conflict, and hatred could combine. In the present chapter, I explore the implications of the patterns of understanding empathy by which interpreters made the sentence make sense for social unity.

  TEN  Participatory Bonding through Painting: from:

  Abstract: John Ruskin, who invented the term, believed that the pathetic fallacy was a characteristic of modern artistic expression, but not of ancient or medieval painters.¹ However, the task of the present chapter is to indicate the importance of the performance engendered by the pathetic and affective fallacies in a great controversy of late ancient, or early medieval, culture—namely, the Iconoclastic Dispute. That conflict arose in the eighth century, in Byzantium, and, inciting great political and military strife, eventually drew into the debate scholars and princes even in distant regions of the West.

  Abstract: Language, even though a universal human attribute, may not always possess universal significance across cultures. That is to say, different language groups may view the place of language in the world, and in human experience, in different ways Beliefs about language in turn reflect as well as shape the techniques a culture uses for processing and communicating knowledge. The Balinese manifest complex beliefs about language consistent with their elaborate material and ritual culture, m surveying these beliefs we are brought into contact with an equally ornate system of metaphysical interpretations. These interpretations have important bearing on vocal traditions, literary forms,<br>

  Book Title: Fictions in Autobiography-Studies in the Art of Self-Invention<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAKIN PAUL JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Investigating autobiographical writing of Mary McCarthy, Henry James, Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Friedlander, and Maxine Hong Kingston, this book argues that autobiographical truth is not a fixed but an evolving content in a process of self-creation. Further, Paul John Eakin contends, the self at the center of all autobiography is necessarily fictive. Professor Eakin shows that the autobiographical impulse is simply a special form of reflexive consciousness: from a developmental viewpoint, the autobiographical act is a mode of self-invention always practiced first in living and only eventually, and occasionally, in writing.<br>

  Book Title: Modernist Anthropology-From Fieldwork to Text<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Manganaro Marc<br>
  Abstract: Recent insights into the nature of representation and power relations have signaled an important shift in perspective on anthropology: from a fieldwork-based "science" of culture to an interpretive activity bound to the discursive and ideological process called "text-making." This collection of essays reflects the ongoing cross-fertilization between literary criticism and anthropology. Focusing on texts written or influenced by anthropologists between 1900 and 1945, the work relates current perspectives on anthropology's discursive nature to the literary period known as "Modernism.".<br>

  The Historical Materialist Critique of Surrealism and Postmodernist Ethnography from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvt1j">Modernist Anthropology</a><br>
  Author(s) WEBSTER STEVEN<br>
  Abstract: Form has become important in some contemporary ethnographic writing. However, the social theory implicit in the writing cannot be easily distinguished from its form. History is obscured in this merger, which is itself historic. In the social sciences, the long-established distinction between aesthetic criticism and social science, although often questioned, seems to have become blurred in practice and problematic in theory since about the 1960s. In aesthetics and literary criticism, on the other hand, the apparent convergence has long been implicit in the conceptual framework of modernism. Since the 1970s the perhaps related processes in some of the social sciences<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  Explanations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvvd9">The Writer Writing</a><br>
  Abstract: Explanation is almost co-extensive with consciousness. “Explanations”—the title of this chapter—is a much less daunting topic. The following discussion is limited to a description of two distinct models of explanation, the “scientific” or “covering law” model and the historical or “processive” model and an analysis of how these two models are ‘parodied’ respectively by Shaw and Proust in their particular acts as writers, their philosophic acts of explanation.<br>

  Four  Conrad: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvwf7">The Semantics of Desire</a><br>
  Abstract: The collapse of human structures, when subjected to unremitting natural forces, troubles Conrad’s imagination more than it does Hardy’s. Despite the bleakness of Hardy’s outlook—his view of life as an inherently unsanctioned process, an empty sequence of happenstances—he retained an enabling attachment (however complicated) to his native Dorset countryside. He absorbed its legends, its history, its customs, its landscape; and these absorptions may account for the modulated tone of even his darkest utterances. He is not surprised, his tone keeps repeating, because what is human history if not the immemorial story of expectation drained dry by time’s passage?<br>

  7  Exploring Transdisciplinarity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zw15">Transdisciplinarity</a><br>
  Author(s) Macdonald Roderick<br>
  Abstract: One of the crucial activities in any transdisciplinary endeavor is the process of clarifying assumptions, recognizing commonalities and differences, and formulating a working agreement in order to achieve a particular goal. Our assigned goal was to generate a definition of transdisciplinarity. The working group divided its time into three phases: initial exploratory discussion, a more focused effort to create a single definition, and preparation of an oral report to the colloquium.<br>

  Author(s) Rapport David J<br>
  Abstract: We leave this text, in a metaphysical sense, in mid-sentence. But this is appropriate. It will be for many others to write the next paragraphs, chapters, and books in the evolution of transdisciplinarity. Transdisciplinarity is a dynamic process, not a static event, and it is one which will continue to need increasingly deep, broad, and diverse contributions. Transdisciplinarity is an idea whose time has come and one whose time will remain.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zwn7">Barbarous Dissonance and Images of Voice in Milton's Epics</a><br>
  Abstract: The act of narrating the Genesis story is constantly frustrated; even the angelic historian finds the task daunting:“Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift / Than time or motion, but to human ears / Cannot without process of speech be told” (7.176—8). As the subject of a critical and self-conscious text, the original account of earth’s creation is fragmented;¹ and because the account competes with creation stories presented by the different characters in the poem, it is also decentred. The official historical and epic narratives are constantly intercepted by the multiple narrators in

  4  Experience and the Retrospective Glance to the Past from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zxm6">Subaltern Appeal to Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: The experiential process may well appear future-oriented insofar as it remains recalcitrant to seamless integration within prior expectations and insofar as it perturbs routinized perceptions, actions, and attitudes. Yet it also involves the
                  retrospective revision, and not the outright dismissal, of the earlier orientations it disrupts. Experience harbours two temporal maneuvers: an initial disruption of the given is followed by a retrospective revision of the past so as to accommodate the new and reestablish continuity. At hand in dialectical experience is what can be called – what has in fact already been called by Kristeva, Heidegger, Luhmann, and others –<br>

  5  Experience and the Temporal Logic of Late Modernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zxm6">Subaltern Appeal to Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: A confluence of sociohistorical vectors so impinged on processes of self-formation, then, that by the mid- to late eighteenth century the self increasingly becomes a narrative of events, or, to use Taylor’s expression, a “chain of happenings.” And these events, or happenings, insofar as they are reflexively reworked into a self’s horizon, are what experience is all about. But it is legitimate at this point to ask whether the continuity between the late eighteenth and the late twentieth century noted by Taylor still holds – whether, in other words, those late-eighteenth-century socio-historical preconditions for an accentuated role of experience in<br>

  Abstract: From their earliest days comparative literature studies have lived in a paradox: they presuppose universals at work within human literatures and cultures, and seek to bring them to light through the examination of the diversity of these literatures and cultures. In recent decades the entire field of literary studies has undergone a vast movement of self-examination and self-legitimation as part of a wider movement among the human sciences to demonstrate both their scientific worth and their relevance to the situation and psyche of mankind. The question remains, however, whether this search for truth, necessarily underpinned by questioning the process of<br>

  Abstract: As is well known, in recent decades literary studies, and more particularly comparative literary studies, have undergone a process of reexamination, for reasons of their own as well as for reasons linked to the challenge of other disciplines, those designated today “the human sciences.” My title implies, in hope at least, a change of emphasis: the impact of such disciplines as linguistics, psychoanalysis, sociology, and cultural anthropology has often been perceived as potentially aggressive, and harmful, with respect to the specificity of literary studies. But literary studies have emerged from this test not only without loss of specificity but having<br>

  Author(s) ELLIOTT ROBIN<br>
  Abstract: Anhalt’s emigration to Canada was part of a significant postwar demographic movement. In 1946 the Canadian government approved emergency measures to allow the immigration of refugees and displaced persons in a belated attempt to make amends for having done so little to provide safe haven for the oppressed of Europe during the war. Between 1947 and 1952, over 165,000 people arrived in Canada under the terms of these emergency measures. Like Anhalt, the majority of them came by boat from Europe and were processed through Halifax’s Pier 21, a large two-storey immigration building with barred windows on the waterfront in<br>

  Author(s) Nutbrown Richard<br>
  Abstract: “Politics,” Michael Oakeshott has argued, “is the activity of attending to the general arrangements of a set of people whom chance or choice have brought together” (1967:112). In light of the extraordinary political changes taking place in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, this view of politics seems rather staid and unspirited. But Oakeshott’s point is worth repeating: as a learning process deeply rooted in the particular historical circumstances of a people, ordinary politics is a matter of intimations. It is the activity of translating and inscribing the allusive fluctuations of everyday collective existence into familiar and routine terms of reference. Politics,<br>

  Author(s) Phillips Susan D.<br>
  Abstract: As a scholar of Canadian politics, Khayyam Z. Paltiel was concerned with the appropriate and equitable representation of interests in the policy process. In particular, he addressed the issue of whether interest groups have displaced political parties as the fundamental agents of representation and democratic legitimation in the Canadian political system and he examined the impact of special interest groups on the Canadian state (1989, 1982). Because interest groups of all kinds have proliferated since the 1960s, they now are often in vigorous competition with each other, as well as with political parties, in the policy-making process. However, interest groups<br>

  Author(s) Gibbons Kenneth M.<br>
  Abstract: The centrality of “clean, fair, honest elections” — what might reasonably be called ethical elections — in a democratic system is widely understood by citizens, politicians and academics alike. The very nature of democratic legitimacy rests, in large part, on the integrity of the electoral process, however this integrity might be defined. Given normal expectations typical of many sociopolitical concepts, this definition will vary in detail from one political system to another, or from one subsystem to another within the same political system.<br>

  Abstract: With the above quotation the Dutch philosopher Ton Lemaire started his essay “The Appearance of Landscape,” which describes the evolution of a neutral space into a meaningful landscape. Apparently “landscape” is not an a priori category; it has to emerge from the disordered elements of the world.

  Abstract: Poetry, like fiction, has a time-sense, and it is worth extending the ideas laid out in “Time’s Andromedas” to the formal – rather than thematic – elements of Bishop’s poetics. Generally, critics writing about Bishop have used the question of time to buttress arguments about the “mind thinking”: the notion that Bishop’s goal is to capture the feeling of a mind in the process of working out a thought rather than a mind relating a fully formed idea. The distinction is one Bishop found in an essay on Baroque prose by Morris Croll and used in both a paper of her own<br>

  Abstract: Rule-making is a twofold process of representation; there are rulers who act officially as warrants of the interests of the whole, and there are mediators who act in the name of more specific interests. In the contemporary world politics can be understood as the interplay of agents who claim to represent the interests of others. As societies grow more complex, people tend to delegate the task of promoting their interests to those who specialize in representation. These specialists may be lobbyists, pressure groups, or political parties. The highest and most encompassing level of representation is indeed that attained by legislators,<br>

Topics examined include the essential and continuing duality of the self, the process by which the self becomes self-consciousness, freedom as the dialectical tension between necessity and possibility and between temporality and eternity, the indeterminate/determinate leap as freedom's form, and love as freedom's content.<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Narrativity-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): RUTLAND BARRY<br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine a community that is not divided into at least two gender groups. It is equally impossible to imagine a community that does not tell or enact stories. The relationship between these universal aspects of human culture is the mainspring of Gender and Narrativity. From Genesis to Freud, the Western narrative tradition tells the same old story of masculine dominance/feminine subservience as a matter of divine will or natural truth. Here, nine Canadian scholars challenge and interpret this tradition, in effect "re-telling" the story of gender, and themselves intervening in the narrative process. Critical readings from a wide range of literary texts - medieval and modern, European and Canadian - replace abstract theory in these studies, while sociology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and new history are the axes of discussion. This book exemplifies the current range and diversity of Canadian critical writing.<br>

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): SMYTHE KAREN E.<br>
  Abstract: The title, Figuring Grief, refers to the narrative process whereby mourning is depicted. In her textual analysis, Smythe explores various connections between representation and consolation. Drawing on genre and narratological theory, she outlines the development of the "fiction-elegy" as a sub-genre and suggests that the modernist writings of Woolf and Joyce are paradigmatic examples of the form. She then uses these paradigms as suggestive "reading models" for the interpretation of works by Gallant, Munro, and other contemporary fiction-elegists. Figuring Grief offers new readings of specific works and suggests that new ways of reading are both demanded and rewarded by a poetics of elegy.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 2 I argued that Gallant figures the elegiac in her fiction in a variety of ways, including the use of plot as trope, experimentation with contrasting points of view, and the subversion of sequential chronology. The work of mourning is demonstrated in Gallant’s stories to be a form of “narrative thinking,” which, according to John Robinson and Linda Hawpe, “consists of creating a fit between a situation and the story schema. Establishing a fit, that is, making a story out of experience, is a heuristic process,” they continue, “one which requires skill, judgment, and experience.”¹ The reader, too,<br>

This loss resonated with the French, who had dealt with smaller epidemics in France and were also mourning their absent communities through a nostalgia for home.

  Abstract: This chapter begins by examining Johann Baptist Metz’s early understanding of the modern process of secularization and his effort to present a positive interpretation of this process in light of Catholic theology. By tracing the manner in which Metz approached this task in his writing through 1966, we will see that it was through engaging the process of secularization that a distinctive eschatology emerged in his theological program. His transcendental-linear theology of history presented a productive apologetic resource, allowing him to affirm the ongoing validity of Christianity for those who experienced the process of secularization as a threat to their<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 1, we saw that Metz’s eschatological project developed out of his theological analysis of the modern process of secularization, was unduly limited by his transcendental-linear theology of history, and gradually emerged as a practical-critical hope for the future. Now, turning to Edward Schillebeeckx’s efforts to address the apologetic consequences of secularization during the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, we will trace similar developments that unfold over significantly different terrain; Schillebeeckx offered a distinctive response to the same historical challenges, yet during this period the doctrine of eschatology also would move to the center of his theological project.<br>

  5  Metz Contends with a History Marked by Suffering: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0t4j">Hope in Action</a><br>
  Abstract: In the preceding two chapters, when tracing the developments in Schillebeeckx’s thought from the late 1960s through the early 1990s, we observed in his writings his increasing unease with the historical processes of secularization and the distinct form of progressive optimism underlying European and North American technocratic societies. In search of a theological response to what critical theorists called the “dialectic of Enlightenment,” Schillebeeckx turned to the critical negativity of Christianity’s eschatological hope. He saw in that hope a powerful resource capable of resisting the dangerous excesses of the period’s myopic commitment to technological progress while concurrently animating the Christian’s<br>

  1  Overtures for Change from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0tr7">Liturgy as Revelation</a><br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, various themes arose to prominence within the mind of the church. Some surfaced from within, by the natural process of maturation and development, while others resulted from sharp reminders given by a rapidly changing secular world. Among these, perhaps the most significant, and that because its influence was so far-reaching, was the awakening to a sense of history.¹ This questioned fundamentally the prevailing certainties of knowledge, and had the potential to transform the intellectual disciplines completely. To become aware of historicity is to acknowledge a sense of contingency, pluralism, and the possibility of change. Much that<br>

  Book Title: Reading Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Reading is one of the basic skills a student needs. But reading is not just an activity of the eyes and the brain. Reading Theologically, edited by Eric D. Barreto, brings together eight seminary educators from a variety of backgrounds to explore what it means to be a reader in a seminary context--to read theologically. Reading theologically involves a specific minset adn posture towards texts and ideas, people and communities alike. Reading theologically is not just about academic skill building but about the formation of a ministerial leader who can engage scholarship critically, interpret Scripture and tradition faithfully, welcome different perspectives, and help lead others to do the same. This brief, readable, edited volume emphasizes the vital skills, habits, practices, and values involved in reading theologically. Reading Theologically is a vital resource for students beginning the seminary process and professors of introductory level seminary courses.<br>

  Abstract: The establishment of an explicit genealogy that traces modernity, and, subsequently, the concept of nihilism as substantial
                  res, back to John Duns Scotus (d. 1308) occurred through an evolutionary process. In recent history, this genealogy finds its advent in the seminal work of John Milbank, and it is upon the foundation of his work that others have constructed edifices built on the narrative of Scotus astheprotomodern antagonist. Displacing the early modern Enlightenment thinkers, Scotus serves as the inaugurator of all that is ill with modernity.

  3  Foundational Dialogic Characteristics in Godʹs Fierce Whimsy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0vfb">Walking with the Mud Flower Collective</a><br>
  Abstract: Dialogue is a term used and affirmed frequently in theology published today. Yet such usage and affirmation do not always translate into actual evidence of dialogue in published work. Undeniably, dialogue may be the means by which a theological work comes into being as a published product,¹ but the emphasis and priority often lie not on this process but on the goal—the end result that entails distinct, definitive claims that can be accessed online or sent to press. In other words, as it concerns theological method, most theological work is primarily teleological in focus,² and while such an approach<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0vjs">The World in the Trinity</a><br>
  Abstract: Part One of this book was basically philosophical in its orientation. In chapter 1, I proposed that our understanding of the world around us is at least partly conditioned by the language we habitually employ. Given our Western emphasis on the priority of nouns to verbs in sentence construction, we tend to see the world in terms of individual things with various contingent relationships to one another. An emphasis on verbs, however, might lead us to the belief that physical reality is in flux and seems to be constituted by coordinated processes or systems.

  Abstract: Without question, the Roman Catholic Church and all other Christian denominations are longstanding institutional entities in the contemporary world. But is their reality as institutional entities here and now ultimately secondary to their deeper reality as historically grounded systems or processes for handing on a specific doctrinal and liturgical tradition from one generation to the next over hundreds or even thousands of years? In other words, is the Church primarily an institutional entity with a relatively fixed identity as a result of its longstanding doctrinal and liturgical heritage, or is the Church primarily a process or system for handing on<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0vjs">The World in the Trinity</a><br>
  Abstract: It might initially seem strange to link analysis of the possibility of miracles, that is, special divine interventions into the workings of the natural order, with the longstanding philosophical problem of evil in a book dedicated to a process-oriented understanding of the God-world relationship. For, if the symbiotic relationship between the natural and the supernatural order of events is working properly, then there should be no need for God to suspend or even to tinker with the normal workings of nature so as to help human beings to deal with some catastrophic series of events in the world of nature<br>

  4  Eco-Anthropologies in the Joban God-Speech from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0vtn">Consider Leviathan</a><br>
  Abstract: Since his own assent to the Adversary’s acts of torture in Job 2, God has not spoken—a haunting silence. As Paul Ricoeur explains, the process of narrativization can proceed with two distinct effects: (1) The narrative interprets by way of amplification or explanation, by providing a “why” (God did this
                  because…), or (2) the “inverse of amplification,” or “reticence.”¹ Opacity has its own power—the longer the Joban characters have argued about Job’s personal relationship to nature and wrongdoing, the longer God is silent, and the more intensely the characters must wonder about the divine perspective.

  Book Title: Culture, Rhetoric and the Vicissitudes of Life-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Carrithers Michael<br>
  Abstract: Inspired by the Rhetoric Culture Project, this volume focuses on the use of imagery, narrative, and cultural schemes to deal with predicaments that arise during the course of life. The contributors explore how people muster their resources to understand and deal with emergencies such as illness, displacement, or genocide. In dealing with such circumstances, people can develop new rhetorical forms and, in the process, establish new cultural resources for succeeding generations. Several of the contributions show how rhetorical cultural forms can themselves create emergencies. The contributors bring expertise from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology and communications studies, underlining the volume's wider relevance as a reflection on the human condition.<br>

  Author(s) Stoetzler Marcel<br>
  Abstract: This chapter is about a series of contradictions in Hannah Arendt’s writings, contradictions that she names and explores, and contradictions in her own discourse. Arendt’s writings are a declaration of antipathy to the bourgeoisie by a thoroughly bourgeois writer, a defense of the nation-state based on dislike of nationalism, a defense of traditional bourgeois values from modern bourgeois domination, and an account of the modern state that granted the Jews emancipation at a point when, by becoming national, it was in the process of preparing the renewal of the Jews’ exclusion and persecution.<br>

  8  Memory History and the Standardization of History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qck1n">Popular Historiographies in the 19th and 20th Centuries</a><br>
  Author(s) Langewiesche Dieter<br>
  Abstract: ‘Memory history’ (
                  Erinnerungsgeschichte) is found at the start of every process of historical transmission.¹ As a theoretically grounded approach in the methodological arsenal of historical studies, however, it is a relatively new branch of historical inquiry, albeit one that is rapidly growing. The catastrophic experiences of the first half of the twentieth century contributed considerably to this. They created, according to Dan Diner in his European-oriented, universalhistorical attempt to understand this period, a separate ‘time of remembrance’, whose ‘negative telos’ overlaid other experiences and taught us to view history differently (Diner 2000: 17). The remembrance of this period, together with<br>

  Book Title: The Rhetorical Emergence of Culture-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Girke Felix<br>
  Abstract: "Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.<br>

  Author(s) Emrich Hinderk M.<br>
  Abstract: The act of remembering does not necessarily relate to what has actually taken place; it has a peculiar, intrinsically metaphorical quality of “as if.” Remembering is a process of representing that does not merely involve calling up data as if playing back a tape recording or running a CD-ROM. Rather, representing something by remembering it creates an experiential context along the lines of “Things are just like they were back then.” Genuine remembering is a process of transporting oneself back, of retrieving a past emotional situation. We are what we are because of our past experience; our existence is always<br>

  Author(s) Amit Vered<br>
  Abstract: The topic of student travel readily evokes two long-standing tropes of transition and change. On the one hand, youth is commonly regarded as quintessentially ephemeral. On the other hand, since the Grand Tour of the sixteenthth and seventeenth centuries, travel has often been associated with processes of self-formation and transformation. Both youth and travel also call to mind the interaction between change as a modality of personal as well as broader social formation. Thus the Grand Tour through Continental Europe was intended to serve as the basis for the cultivation of elite tastes among young British aristocrats. The transitions identified<br>

  Book Title: Ethno-Baroque-Materiality, Aesthetics and Conflict in Modern-Day Macedonia<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Dimova Rozita<br>
  Abstract: In post-1991 Macedonia,
      Barokfurniture came to represent affluence and success during a period of transition to a new market economy. This furniture marked the beginning of a larger Baroque style that influenced not only interior decorations in people's homes but also architecture and public spaces. By tracing the signifier Baroque, the book examines the reconfiguration of hierarchical relations among (ethnic) groups, genders, and countries in a transnational context. Investigating how Baroque has come to signify larger social processes and transformations in the current rebranding of the country, the book reveals the close link between aesthetics and politics, and how ethno-national conflicts are reflected in visually appealing ornamentation.<br>

  Book Title: The French Road Movie-Space, Mobility, Identity<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Archer Neil<br>
  Abstract: The traditionally American genre of the road movie has been explored and reconfigured in the French context since the later 1960s. Comparative in its approach, this book studies the inter-relationship between American and French culture and cinemas, and in the process considers and challenges histories of the road movie. It combines film history with film theory methodologies, analysing transformations in social, political and film-industrial contexts alongside changing perspectives on the meaning and possibilities of film. At once chronological and thematic in structure,
      The French Road Movieprovides in each chapter a comprehensive introduction to key themes emerging from the genre in the French context - liberty, identity and citizenship, masculinity, femininity, border-crossing - followed by detailed, innovative and often revisionist readings of the chosen films. Through these readings the author justifies the place of the road genre within French cinema histories and reinvigorates this often neglected and misunderstood area of study.<br>

  Abstract: If what we understand by ‘transnational cinema’ is to a large extent still a definition in progress, the connection between mobility and travel within the terms of the transnational has assumed critical currency. To suggest that this is a necessary connection is really to beg the question, in fact, of what transnational means, and more specifically what is at stake in the process of naming it. This is an important task, given that the recent topicality of transnational cinema, as far as its academic study is concerned, is based less on its status as a cinematic trend, than on the<br>

  Abstract: In societies that experience catastrophic events, numerous practices are aimed at endowing those events with meaning. The contingent nature of a catastrophe and the disorder it creates are inconsistent with the human sense of reason and provoke anxiety. To overcome the anxiety and limit the disorder, societies generally seek to reestablish order by explaining the catastrophe and by evaluating it, narrating it, commemorating it, and trying to prevent its repetition. All of these processes enable people to deal actively with the disorienting event and to convert disorder into order (Balandier 1988).<br>

  Book Title: Protest Beyond Borders-Contentious Politics in Europe since 1945<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Romanos Eduardo<br>
  Abstract: The protest movements that followed the Second World War have recently become the object of study for various disciplines; however, the exchange of ideas between research fields, and comparative research in general, is lacking. An international and interdisciplinary dialogue is vital to not only describe the similarities and differences between the single national movements but also to evaluate how they contributed to the formation and evolution of a transnational civil society in Europe. This volume undertakes this challenge as well as questions some major assumptions of post-1945 protest and social mobilization both in Western and Eastern Europe. Historians, political scientists, sociologists and media studies scholars come together and offer insights into social movement research beyond conventional repertoires of protest and strictly defined periods, borders and paradigms, offering new perspectives on past and present processes of social change of the contemporary world.<br>

  Abstract: The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement (hereafter, CRM) between the 1960s and early 1970s shifted from an inclusive, reformist movement to an exclusivist, ethnonationalist one.* What is the explanation for such a significant transformation? This chapter seeks to answer the question by looking at the complex interactions of political opportunities/threats and the internal dynamics and competitiveness between different organizations and groups within the movement. What I am suggesting in this work is that much of the process of social movement development is understandable only by looking at the broader political environment as well as by looking within the movement itself.<br>

  Book Title: Narrating the Nation-Representations in History, Media and the Arts<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Mycock Andrew<br>
  Abstract: A sustained and systematic study of the construction, erosion and reconstruction of national histories across a wide variety of states is highly topical and extremely relevant in the context of the accelerating processes of Europeanization and globalization. However, as demonstrated in this volume, histories have not, of course, only been written by professional historians. Drawing on studies from a number of different European nation states, the contributors to this volume present a systematic exploration, of the representation of the national paradigm. In doing so, they contextualize the European experience in a more global framework by providing comparative perspectives on the national histories in the Far East and North America. As such, they expose the complex variables and diverse actors that lie behind the narration of a nation.<br>

  Chapter 5  The Institutionalisation and Nationalisation of Literature in Nineteenth-century Europe from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdcbq">Narrating the Nation</a><br>
  Author(s) Neubauer John<br>
  Abstract: Textual criticism is very old, but modern philology, including literary scholarship was born in the decades either side of 1800. I shall argue that the institutionalisation of literary scholarship in the nineteenth century was deeply implicated in the formation and development of modern nationalism. How this Europe-wide process developed, how ideas about national literature crossed borders and assumed new meanings has not yet been explained in an overarching manner, though valuable contributions on individual national literatures have been made.<br>

  Author(s) Wintle Michael<br>
  Abstract: National narratives have been expressed in a variety of different ways, most commonly and perhaps most importantly in print. However, identities and narratives can also be expressed visually, with an often immediate effect that rivals other media in the representation of complex human messages and emotions. This chapter will pay particular attention to ‘the visual’ in the process of narrating the nation. Chronologically the highpoint of national self-assertion among European nations was reached around the time of New Imperialism in the decades before the First World War, a period of intense nationalism. This was also a peak period in the<br>

  Book Title: Young Men in Uncertain Times-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Dyck Noel<br>
  Abstract: Anthropology is particularly well suited to explore the contemporary predicament in the coming of age of young men. Its grounded and comparative empiricism provides the opportunity to move beyond statistics, moral panics, or gender stereotypes in order to explore specific aspects of life course transitions, as well as the similar or divergent barriers or opportunities that young men in different parts of the world face. Yet, effective contextualization and comparison cannot be achieved by looking at male youths in isolation. This volume undertakes to contextualize male youths' circumstances and to learn about their lives, perspectives, and actions, and in turn illuminates the larger structures and processes that mediate the experiences entailed in becoming young men. The situation of male youths provides an important vantage point from which to consider broader social transformations and continuities. By paying careful attention to these contexts, we achieve a better understanding of the current influences encountered and acted upon by young people.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdff2">Conflicted Memories</a><br>
  Author(s) Horne John<br>
  Abstract: The first half of the twentieth century was the most violent period in modern European history. War, revolution, civil war, and the deliberate displacement or destruction of entire ethnic and cultural communities characterized much of the continent from 1914 to the early 1950s. Thereafter, conflict was frozen in less lethal and more institutionalized forms until the final decade of the century, when the end of the Cold War was followed by the extraordinarily peaceful integration of Europe—a process that continues today. The exception has been the violent implosion of Yugoslavia.<br>

  Author(s) Mergel Thomas<br>
  Abstract: Ideas of European integration are mostly shaped by the image of an increasing merger of distinct states. In this process differences are dissolved to be finally subsumed into one coherent social and political space with one homogenous public sphere inhabited by actors who perceive each other as similar. This idea derives from the common experience of the nation- building process and its homogenizing effects since the nineteenth century: diverse societies built a common new form, where differences were largely extinguished. This perspective has not remained unchallenged: disapproving skeptics highlight the value of European plurality, which should not be pressed into<br>

  Author(s) Steiner André<br>
  Abstract: The Europeanization of economic life is not a new phenomenon in recent history. Traders have consistently been connected throughout the various parts of Europe, and the emergence of the modern nation-state did not bring transnational economic activities to an end. The first multinationals emerged in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century, and their economic importance further increased in the twentieth century. But the attempt to create a transnational economic area with supranational institutions was successful for the first time only after the Second World War. Western European integration began as an economic process with the Marshall Plan,<br>

  Abstract: It is all too easy for historians to allow the Cold War division process of 1947–1948 to retroactively overshadow the tentative character of the apprehensions, projects, and choices guiding different political actors during the postwar planning period that spanned from the final phase of the Second World War and the immediate transition to conditions of peace. It is all too easy to forget the weight of history felt by European postwar planners at that time, realized primarily as fear: of a repetition of the economic chaos after the First World War, and of renewed German aspirations to avenge and<br>

  Abstract: This chapter addresses what are often seen as the practical issues of exhibition-making as a theoretical problem of translation – with all the transformative effects of moving between languages¹ – and as a didactic device. It begins by invoking anthropological concern about recent developments in the museum world. It goes on to consider how (what are often thought of as) technical aspects the process of making a temporary exhibition at the University of Oslo Ethnographic Museum were used as a didactic device. Finally, there is a discussion of how these technical matters fit into the theoretical operation of translation that exhibition-making involves.<br>

  Book Title: Between Educationalization and Appropriation-Selected Writings on the History of Modern Educational Systems<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vervenne Marc<br>
  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

  Author(s) Simon F.<br>
  Abstract: In Europe between the two World Wars, youth constituted a notable arena for the manifestation of social polarizations. From the 1920s on, the political scene shifted markedly to the right: theories of the New Order proclaimed the failure of parliamentary democracy, and in Italy Fascism (Mussolini in 1922) and in Germany Nazism (Hitler in 1933) acquired real political power. In both countries, an authoritarian state was established and war was proclaimed against the Red Peril of Communism. The youth, as the future cornerstone of the ideology and the regime, was assigned a central part in this process. Groupings attached to<br>

  Author(s) Smeyers P.<br>
  Abstract: In several Western societies we witness today an increasing tendency to “educationalize” social problems. As an institution, the school is, among other things, held accountable for solving social inequalities (related to class, race, and gender); for reducing traffic deaths, obesity, teenage sex, and environmental destruction; and for enhancing public health, economic productivity, citizenship, and even performances in sport contests such as the Olympic Games. Pushing these kind of “social” responsibilities on schools is a process that has been under way for a long time and coincides with the role of education in the formation of the modern nation-state.

  Author(s) ARBUTHNOT Sharon<br>
  Abstract: ‘Compilation’ is a largely self-explanatory term. Used of a medieval literary activity, it refers to a recycling process whereby extracts culled from a variety of manuscript sources are cobbled together to create new texts. In a crude, although convenient, analogy, one might suggest that compiling is the textual equivalent of creating a mosaic – the fragments originally belong to very different contexts, a certain amount of compiler-provided ‘grout’ holds the entirety together, and the end product is a quite distinct artefact in itself. In the twelfth and thirteen centuries, learned Irishmen expended a great deal of energy in this direction,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdz7w">Origins and Ends of the Mind</a><br>
  Author(s) de Block Andreas<br>
  Abstract: Griesinger and Kraepelin qualified paranoia as one of the three major psychotic disorders, together with schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis (Griesinger 1845, Kraepelin 1915). In psychoanalytic thinking, paranoia even became the paradigmatic form of psychosis. Freud’s only case-studies of psychotic patients, for instance, were devoted to paranoid individuals (Freud 1911, Freud 1915). Jacques Lacan (1988), and to a lesser degree Melanie Klein (1946), pursued this line of thinking by considering paranoia as the essence of the psychotic process (Roudinesco & Plon 1997). Contemporary psychiatric nosography, however, handles schizophrenia as the central taxon. In fact, schizophrenia has become a more or less generic<br>

  Abstract: In what way can Freudian psychoanalysis help contribute to a naturalist, yet non-reductionist anthropology? Such an anthropology would be one that takes into account the significance of the natural history of the human species for our understanding of the human being, but without reducing the specificity of the human to processes of natural or sexual selection. The question of reductionism is all the more relevant today given that naturalism has become a major paradigm in contemporary philosophy. Simply put, naturalism’s basic tenet is that human beings are genealogically related to each other and have common ancestors with other species. Nevertheless,<br>

Such skepticism demonstrates that human rights are still in what An Na’im has termed ‘a process of universalization’. Their full realization is an aim to which all States have committed themselves, and which is dependent on (1) domestic political willingness and strong institutions, (2) grassroots support, (3) international assistance, and (4) evenhandedness.

It is a community that originates in Berlin, a particular form of social movement, and a specific technological approach to computer networking. The tale of Freifunk’s emergence and distillation tells of a process in which the everyday tactics of solving one’s own problems (in this case, a lack of Internet access) are integrated with a more general strategy of political subversion. Thus it is also a tale of how technical appropriation becomes a sociotechnical subversion. To<br>

  Abstract: Consumption has been theorized as a process of appropriation (Miller 1997) where consumers adjust, reframe, hack, or otherwise infuse their own meanings and intentions into the commodities they buy and use. Information and communications technologies (ICTs) are no exception (Horst and Miller 2006; Burrell 2011). Designers of ICTs are increasingly recognizing consumer appropriation in various ways. One way is to hire anthropologists and user experience researchers to conduct what is called user-centered design. This enables firms to better understand and anticipate the ways consumers might appropriate their products. Although fully predicting those uses is impossible, the premise of user-centered design<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I examine Maria-Mercè Marçal’s distinctive feminist thought and her contribution to the scope of Catalan feminism. I also argue how this feminist dimension results from a profound meditation on her experience as a woman and the consequent dialectic relationship with the process of writing. I attempt to demonstrate how in Marçal’s aesthetics, feminism and poetry become inextricably linked and interdependent, and how both converge in a profoundly heuristic process of the place and space of the female body. In her own words: ‘Que hi ha una relació entre el fet de tenir un cos de dona i<br>

  Abstract: Through a detailed analysis of Marçal’s poetic evolution in the previous chapter, I have examined the conceptual and iconic frameworks that allow the poet to reelaborate her experience around the concept of being, particularly of her
                  ser dona. As a result, the dynamic poetic space and form shapes this remaking, rewriting and rereading of the self. Furthermore, it highlights the system of structures (linguistic and semiotic) that merge in the process of poetically reinscribing female identity. In this third chapter, I consider how the literary space of poetry harnesses the possibility of becoming a subject, formed and conceptualized in alternative<br>

  Abstract: In maintaining the character of Marçal’s poetry as praxis, in Chapter Three I examined poetry as the space where the process of the reconfiguration of reality takes place. Moving from myth to the various levels of reality, I have shown that Marçal concentrated her agency as a writer upon the action of
                  mettere al mondo il mondo. The results attestes to her emergence as a woman poet, and reveales the prevalence of poetic action upon the theme of birth as Marçal’s specific form of creating a novel iconographic female universe. As a writer, she reappropriates the female body and repositions<br>

  Abstract: The “Afro” style of movement and performance began in Brazil in the seventies among radicalized sectors of the Black-mixtured community as a way to recuperate and politicize inherited African cultural practices that had been co-opted by the dictatorship as simply folklore, part of “our Brazilian Heritage.” Twenty years later, it appears that this particular style of dance has a fixed set of codes from which the dancer may construct/choreograph meaning into a performance.

One strain takes an explicitly normative stance regarding what outcomes, relationships, or processes are “good.” Scholarship in this genre provides advice about how legal services lawyers should act in order to optimize the assistance they provide to their clients. They advise on everything from choosing cases and clients from disparate community interests to empowering clients and avoiding paternalism.

The average law teacher’s jurisprudence combined interest balancing, fundamental rights analysis, and institutional coordination between courts, agencies, and the legislature.¹ Legal studies at many law schools were regarded as an autonomous discipline because legal reasoning and legal methods were thought to be sufficiently distinct from the methods of other academic disciplines in the general university.

  Abstract: The sources responsible for the expansion and transformation of the law and economics movement of the 1970s and 1980s have never been adequately explained. One fact remains clear: this movement coincided with the rise of interdisciplinary legal studies and the growing disenchantment with the legal process and fundamental rights schools. In the midst of the disintegration of and disillusionment with mainstream jurisprudence, legal scholars looked outside law to economics for law’s missing authority and the autonomy of legal discourse. Of all the social sciences, economics was the most promising candidate offering “right answers” for law’s problems.<br>

The most striking facet of this transformation has been the success of new forms of jurisprudential discourse or “law talk” in penetrating, subverting, and decentering the conventional forms of legal discourse. The proliferation of different jurisprudential discourses has erased the lines between description and advocacy, making it much more difficult for traditionalists to maintain their belief in neutral and objective law.

A common usage of “marketing” that directly affects children’s literature is “the action, business, or process of promoting and selling a product” (OED). Since the advent of the printing press, literature has been intimately related to marketing.

While totally familiar to us, these paired phenomena—the Bible as a book and reading as the primary means of accessing it—are relatively new developments in the history of Jewish encounters with scripture.

He argues that some problems, like disease, migration, and trade, cannot be dealt with at the level of the state and require international cooperation between states, supranational organizations, and nongovernmental organizations, acting both locally and in the global arena. Calling on his own involvement in the development of such processes, he explains the difficulties of such initiatives and makes a number of concrete<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I present my own investigator’s story, my version of the stories gifted to me as part of a research study into lesbian experiences of social exclusion and mental well-being, and my interpretation of narrative analysis and the use of turning points in narrative. It is a story that, through the process of development, has been presented to different audiences in different formats, received and interpreted differently by each new audience and consequently reinterpreted. The aim here is two-fold: to demonstrate how turning points provide a useful focus of analysis in research that seeks to explore the interaction<br>

  Book Title: The governance of problems-Puzzling, powering and participation<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Hoppe Robert<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary democracies need to develop a better governance of problems, as all too often, policy is a sophisticated answer to the wrong problem. This book offers a compelling approach to public policy-making as problem processing, bringing together aspects of puzzling, powering and participation, relating them in interesting and different ways to cultural theory, to issues about networks, to models of democracy and modes of citizen participation. Part of a growing body of work in policy analysis literature, the book is clearly written and accessibly presented, making this an ideal text for academics and postgraduate students.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgx59">The governance of problems</a><br>
  Abstract: People are problem-processing animals. Not that we are all worrywarts, of course. But people do tend to be concerned about conditions they feel uneasy about. They brood over situations they experience as uncomfortable or troublesome, especially if they see no obvious way out. One might call this the substantive logic of problem processing: experiencing an uncomfortable situation, diagnosing the nature of the problem and figuring out what to do to solve, or at least, alleviate the problem. Most problems have a personal character; they concern people as problem owners, their families, relatives, friends, colleagues, fellow members of sports clubs and<br>

  THREE  Analysing policy problems: from:

  Abstract: This chapter introduces the typology of policy problems that underlies the rest of the book. This requires some preliminary conceptual work. Choosing a social-constructivist approach, the first section develops the perspective of a politics of meaning. It views politics as the collective attempt to control a polity’s shared response to the adversities and opportunities of the human condition. The second section gives an overview of how others have approached the social and political analysis of policy issues or problems. Here the proposal is to look at problem structuring as socio-cognitive processes that frame political task environments. From this perspective, four<br>

  FOUR  Cultures of public policy problems from:

  Abstract: Why do some proximate policy makers prefer to frame and define problems as (over)structured and not un(der)structured? May one predict that policy makers who adhere to different cultures or ways of life will be more inclined to construct and process some problem types rather than other types? How about the congruence between policy makers’ preferred ways of problem framing and structuring, and the cultural inclinations of people in civil society?<br>

If policy making is intertwined cogitation and interaction (Wildavsky, 1980 [1979]), then policy politics is the combination of types of cognitive processes and styles of interaction, characteristic for problem processing in an issue domain. Policy politics is the specific mode or style of policy making among the set of political actors,<br>

  SIX  Problem-structuring dynamics and meta-governance from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgx59">The governance of problems</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores a theory of problem-structuring dynamics. It follows the structuration logic proposed by Giddens (1979), showing how policy actors can influence the nature of institutionalised systems of interaction while at the same time being constrained by them. On the one hand, problem-frame shifts and the possibilities for policy change depend on the structure of policy networks. A closed, institutionalised policy network differs from an open, emergent or decaying network. Part of the difference is in shaping different types of policy-making processes, with different capacities for problem processing, and, therefore, speed, scope and direction of policy change and innovation.<br>

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: Content externalism, as we have seen, is best understood as the thesis that some of those mental states that possess their content essentially – namely, prepositional attitudes – are individuation dependent on objects, properties, relations and so on occurring outside the skins of the subjects of mental states. As such, content externalism is severely restricted in both its scope and force. It applies neither to cognitive processes nor to the architectures or mechanisms in which those processes are realized. It does not apply to phenomenal states – experiences of various forms – at least not if the essential properties of these states are phenomenal<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 6 we saw that the scope of traditional content externalism seemed to be quite narrow. In particular, two central features of the mental seemed untouched by the arguments for content externalism. The first of these, cognitive processes and the architectures that underwrite them, were discussed in Chapter 9, where it was argued that a suitable extension of externalism – from content to vehicle externalism – would underwrite the externality of cognitive processes and architectures. The second feature of the mental arguably untouched by the arguments for content externalism is consciousness, and this is the subject of this chapter.<br>

Fisher noted that our three basic needs for food, security, and love are so intermingled that we cannot think of one without encompassing the others.³ There are two important truths here. The first is that the human mind works so much through a logic of displacement, whereby concerns of one kind are written in the language of another, that in fact mind itself might be regarded as nothing more than the process of displacement.⁴ The second truth is that hunger, its object (food), and its functions (ingestion and digestion) figure prominently in that process.<br>

  Abstract: FEW ISSUES HAVE GENERATED as much academic interest across disciplines in recent years as the process of globalization. The world’s economic, political, demographic, and socio-cultural geography has radically metamorphosed under the impact of technologies and media that shrink time and space in the quest for rapid turnover of capital (Giddens, 1990). Although the long-term effects of globalization on nation states, futures markets, and the drug trade, etc. are unclear at best, none of these approaches the complexities and the problematic status of cultural identity in the globalizing environment.<br>

In the process of remaking himself, over and again, from donnish academic to avant-garde poet, from Joycean acolyte to post-Joycean minimalist, from humanist to post-humanist, perhaps, most certainly from poet to novelist to playwright to theatre director, Beckett was simultaneously reinventing every literary genre he turned his attention to. In the midst of remaking narrative in the wake of World War II, for example, he began simultaneously the reinvention of theatre, writing the ground-breaking (but still unproduced)

  Author(s) PRAGER BRAD<br>
  Abstract: Representations of war are determined not only by the ages in which they appear, but also by the boundaries understood to define war. The idea, for example, that it is not battle but war itself that leaves behind scars presumes that war has both a beginning and an end, or that we can differentiate between the event and its traces. War is, however, an extended process, one that can hardly be isolated or made wholly distinct from peace. The vagueness of the concept suggests that much remains unknown about its limits. For this reason, detailed depictions of occupation are of<br>

In no way is the finiteness of the human creature more evident than in the fact that he must live an earthly existence, and, since things in time have a beginning and an end, that he must be subject to the mysteries of birth and death.

A question that we must ask is why philosophy is expressed in this way?

  Abstract: This study argues that the political and legislative process of forgetting internal differences, undertaken in France after the civil wars of the sixteenth century, leads to subtle yet fundamental shifts in the broader conception of the relationship between readers or spectators on the one hand, and the matter of history, on the other. These shifts, occasioned by the desire for communal reconciliation and generally associated with an increasingly modern sensibility, will nonetheless prove useful to the ideologies of cultural and political absolutism.<br>

Mansfield confronts English-speaking readers with a foreign language that constantly interacts with their mother tongue, creating an intriguing tension between the two languages, both of which are unsettled as a result, and lose their familiarity. This tension puzzles native speakers, whether French or English, albeit through different processes; the title of one of her most famous stories, ‘Je ne parle pas français’, through its very paradoxical nature, epitomises the issue of the interaction between<br>

  5  Arabs as a People and Arabness as an Idea: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2j7h">Imagining the Arabs</a><br>
  Abstract: Thus far, we have traced the sociopolitical drivers of Arab ethnogenesis to the second/eighth century, and we found that the exceptional conditions of early Islam fostered a new idea of ‘Arab community’ as a means for Conquerors to uphold their elite status once the initial burst of conquests had passed. The Conquerors’ towns (
                  al-amṣār) bear striking parallels to the conditions which catalyse ethnogenesis, but the process of creating shared consciousness of Arab community was nonetheless uneven as a consequence of various obstacles impeding the capacity of Arabness to reconcile the Conquerors into one integrated family.

  Abstract: Adaptation, the process by which texts are transformed to suit them to new media (novels made into films) or historical periods (updated theatrical versions of
                  The Seagull) or languages (translations from Russian to English or English to Russian), is essentially a metaphorical concept that is defined and understood, though often without acknowledgment, with reference to the biological processes whereby organisms and species survive by adapting to new environments. The metaphorical valence of the term has only been intensified by the range of synonyms commentators have offered to help understand it.

  Abstract: In its emphasis on verisimilitude and its depiction of social relations, Colson Whitehead’s
                  The Intuitionistis a realist novel and thus deviates substantially from the more experimental set-ups of Castillo’s and Ondaatje’s narratives discussed in Chapters 1 and 2. WhileThe Mixquiahuala Letters’ andThe Collected Works of Billy the Kid’s respective forms emphasise and enact incompleteness, processuality, and divergence (a series of disconnected narrative and poetic vignettes in Ondaatje’s case; a set of letters that present the reader with three divergent story variants in Castillo’s), nothing like that holds for Whitehead’s novel.The Intuitionistcan be described as a<br>

  Abstract: To rehearse: what has been established under the heading of differential narratology is becoming as it pertains to narrative, narrativity in constant variation generating ever new variants of narrative; the virtual dance of narrative differentials producing actual, numerically differentiated narratives; the intensive sensations and forces of transcendental Narrative (affects, percepts, forces) bringing about the extensive states of affairs and networks of empirical narratives (events, existents, plots). In short, becoming, the dynamic and continuous process of selecting and gathering heterogeneous elements to be expressed, has been revealed as the ontologically primary virtual realm of any given actual narrative.

  Abstract: Philosophies of difference, where difference holds its ground without being subordinated to identity, are exceedingly rare. It is not by chance that the fortunes of philosophical heterologies are better served inside process philosophies. Although to be a process philosopher is not a guarantee that one will also be a philosopher of pure difference, movement and the reflection on movement that constitute the raison d’être of the philosophies of process offer a rich soil for the nurture of difference. But a process philosophy, in order to support a purely heterological thought, has to be capable of doing without subjects steering the<br>

  Author(s) Scott Charles E.<br>
  Abstract: As I begin this chapter, I confess to having reservations about the term, ‘postmodernism.’ My reservations have less to do with the philosophical irrelevance of the term that some scholars have alleged, and more with the suffix, -
                  ism; the ways of thinking and writing that ‘postmodern’ names are characterized by departures from thought that is governed by categories and their classifications. This tradition emerged in part as a critique of the ability of categorical thinking to recognize and address appropriately many of the perceptions, processes of thought, experiences, and things that we encounter.

  Author(s) Nassar Dalia T.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most obscure, yet significant, concepts in early nineteenth-century philosophy is that of the Absolute. As a word, the Absolute came into philosophical discourse with Schelling to mean the ontological ground of and point of identity between subject and object. In this sense Hegel adopted the term in his early works, while in his later writings he came to identify the Absolute with the process and final conclusion of reason. Although it is these figures who employed the words ‘the Absolute’ (

  Author(s) Cronin Ciaran<br>
  Abstract: The adjective ‘unconscious’ designates a quality that can be found in psychical processes such as imagining, remembering, thinking, feeling, desiring, wishing and acting. The processes which exhibit this quality differ from those with the quality ‘conscious’ in that the former are not present in the current field of consciousness but nevertheless remain psychologically effective, indeed, often far more so than the processes which have the quality of being conscious. The substantive, the ‘unconscious’, expresses the fact that psychological phenomena are not confined in principle to conscious experiences but are profoundly shaped by unconscious forces. In psychoanalysis, this concept also designates<br>

  Author(s) Outhwaite William<br>
  Abstract: This chapter will examine social philosophy in the nineteenth century in terms of three interrelated processes: the consolidation of a conception of society or the social; the reformulation of issues of poverty and inequality in the form of ‘the social question’ and related attempts at social regulation; and the emergence of the social sciences ‘between literature and science’ (see Lepenies [1985] 1988). Although the term ‘rise’ may seem to suggest an inevitable or desirable process, we shall see that the status of the social sciences and the relation between the social and the political were no less contentious at the<br>

These machines are conceived as tools capable of ‘drawing’ with precisely controlled incremental variations that might match the ‘precise incremental stepping process’ that underpins the cinematographic apparatus of celluloid film and its machines (the camera, the editing table and the projector).

  Author(s) Lawler Steph<br>
  Abstract: As Barbara Hardy, among others, has noted, narratives are integral to social life (1975). People continually tell stories to themselves and to others, gathering up fragments of the day to make a coherent whole, or fragments of occurrences in a life to make a coherent life story. Even though most people will not write autobiographies, all of us are engaged in the projects of our own autobiography, which we manifest every time we tell others about our lives, attend an interview, or simply engage in processes of thinking about and understanding the world and our place within it.

  Abstract: Observation-based research relies on interactions and exchanges between researcher and research participants, and it is this expanded vision of observation – observation that explicitly designs and accounts for the impact of the research process on the fieldwork experience and the data it produces – that the chapter explores. It is based on the premise that communication is a material process in the sense that it is something that can be observed, recorded, documented, analysed and written about. Fieldwork involves finding ways to transform the fleeting character of communication and social relations into durable analysable forms. Other research practices – for<br>

  Abstract: Although this chapter takes a broader view, democracy in Rome is generally considered in the context of the mid-to late Republic. The view that the oligarchy exercised
                  de factocontrol of the voting process in this latter period has been challenged from the 1990s onward (Millar 2002). The ensuing debate has exposed extensive deficiencies in what is known about the democratic process in Rome (Sandberg 2001).

  Author(s) Lau Thomas<br>
  Abstract: Although sixteenth-century humanists regarded Switzerland as an old nation populated by the descendants of the ancient Helvetians, the country, while built on even earlier charters and treaties, emerged as a confederated alliance in a gradual process between 1350 and 1450 (Fossedal 2002: 11–42; Sablonier 2008). It consisted of rural communes in the central Alps and urban communes at Lake Constance, the Upper Rhine and the eastern part of Burgundy. The main reason these communes stayed together was their military success. The conquered territories they administered together could be protected only if the confederates found a way to solve their<br>

  Abstract: The transitions to democracy in Eastern and Central Europe from 1989 onwards not only came as a big surprise both inside and outside the region, they were also characterised by incredible speed and by a radical challenge to the prevailing political cultures during the pressing phase of consolidation. The two companion concepts and processes – transition and consolidation of democratic transformation – are clearly culture-bound and dependent on the historical and present context of the country or region involved. This was particularly the case in Central Europe, where cultural and contextual confusion sometimes led to misunderstanding and friction. Westerners who showed their<br>

  Author(s) Drescher Seymour<br>
  Abstract: During the last three centuries democratisation has occurred at three levels. For individuals, it was a process of extending access to equality of status and the security of liberty under law. Within civil societies, it was the process of extending access to the means of communication and association in economic, social and religious spheres of life. Within polities, it meant the formation of constitutional processes for law making, law enforcement and broadening the access to elections of legislators and executives at all levels of the state. In this perspective anti-slavery was a movement and an ideology primarily concerned with changing<br>

  Author(s) Southall Roger<br>
  Abstract: The democratisation of South Africa has become widely celebrated. Apartheid, a legalised system of white domination over a majority black population imposed by post-1948 National Party (NP) governments, was peculiarly vilified in a post-Nazi, post-colonial world. By the 1980s, the polarisation between pro-democratic forces and the regime was threatening conflagration of the most advanced industrial economy in Africa. Yet in 1994 South Africa held a first democratic election following a four-year transition process whereby previously warring parties negotiated a highly praised constitution founded upon human equality, liberal democracy, a separation of powers, minority representation and socio-economic as well as individual<br>

  Author(s) Anderson James<br>
  Abstract: Transnational democracy is an idea whose time has come, but it does not, as yet, have much substance. It is a thing of the future more than the present, but its future is far from assured. Such democracy as we presently enjoy it is mostly national, rather than transnational, and representative, rather than participatory. It is largely monopolised by elected ‘representatives’, rather than politically active citizens and almost entirely circumscribed by the territoriality of national state borders. The social communities, relations and processes beyond and across state borders that would constitute transnational democracy largely elude democracy’s remit. ‘Globalisation’ and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b74h">Form and Object</a><br>
  Abstract: A kind of ‘thingly’ contamination of the present was brought about through the division of labour, the industrialisation of production, the processing of information, the specialisation of the knowledge of things, and above all the desubstantialisation of these things. In Western philosophical traditions, things were often ordered according to essences, substrata, qualities, predicates,
                  quidditasandquodditas, being and beings. Precluding anything from being equally ‘something’, neither more nor less than any other thing, thus becomes a rather delicate task. We live in this world of things, where a cutting<br>

  Abstract: So far we have seen research from neuropsychology that illustrates the role which nonconscious processing plays in our mental lives. This is connected to the world around us through the role of the body in processing and cognition. One further aspect of this picture is emotion and affect. This chapter will seek to investigate the emotive aspect in thought and the debates as to its biological or social nature. Without going too far down the well-worn road of the nature/nurture debate, it is fairly uncontroversial to claim a socially constructed aspect to emotional experience and expression, even if one believes<br>

  Abstract: Buddhism likens its psychological techniques to a raft that is used to cross a river, the river being 
                  dukkha. The raft is merely a tool to be used to gain the further shore and then to be abandoned, its task fulfilled. Likewise, the conceptual apparatus used by Buddhism to effect change should not be clung to after their task is fulfilled. (One may ask whether the task of positive mental transformation is ever at an end and schools such as Zen do posit an ongoing process). These techniques are dubbed ‘skilful means’ and are the conceptual toolkit of Buddhist philosophy<br>

  Abstract: In the last chapter we considered the way metaphor helped to shape and structure the worldview of Czech communists in the 1970s. We were, however, forced to accept that we were often dealing with three different kinds of worldview. The Czech language itself, as a network of concepts, conceptual links and linguistic habits, had been remodelled by the forces of the Marxist–Leninist worldview. This was by no means a one-way process: on the contrary, the concepts of ‘people’, ‘folk’ and ‘nation’ which were fundamental to the communist worldview were modelled using the plastic material of the Czech imagination, an<br>

The pessimist and the fatalist will conclude that ideology and cultural mindsets are inescapable. From such a perspective, a worldview appears as a confining space, a prison. And, indeed, it seems true that in thinking and in expression, metaphor (one constitutive element of all worldviews) is ubiquitous and inescapable.

  Abstract: In this essay I will explore the eco-philosophical aspects of the ethics of becoming, with reference to the project of nomadic subjectivity and sustainability. The urge that prompts this investigation is not only abstract, but also very practical. Nomadic philosophy mobilises one’s affectivity and enacts the desire for in-depth transformations in the status of the kind of subjects we have become. Such in-depth changes, however, are at best demanding and at worst painful processes. My political generation, that of the baby-boomers, has had to come to terms with this harsh reality, which put a check on the intense and often<br>

What if there emerges some evanescent darkness, some momentary shift invested with the misery of an onslaught of disturbing reverberations? Responding to this in confusion, perhaps you construct an Idea, a structure, a multiplicity, a system of multiple, nonlocalisable ideal connections which is then incarnated. It is incarnated in real (not ideal) relations and actual (physical) terms, each of which exists only in<br>

  Book Title: Memory and the Moving Image-French Film in the Digital Era<br>

  Author(s): McNeill Isabelle<br>
  Abstract: A vital rethinking of memory and the moving image for the digital age, Isabelle McNeill investigates the role of the moving image in cultural memory, considering the impact of digital technologies on visual culture. Drawing on an interdisciplinary range of theoretical resources and an unusual body of films and moving image works, the author examines the ways in which recent French filmmaking conceptualises both the past and the workings of memory. Ultimately the author argues that memory is an intersubjective process, in which filmic forms continue to play a crucial role even as new media come to dominate our contemporary experience.Memory and the Moving Image:*Introduces new ways of thinking about the relation between film and memory, arising from a compelling, interdisciplinary study of theories and films*Subtly explores the French context while drawing theoretical conclusions with wider implications and applicability*Provides detailed and illuminating close readings of varied moving image works to aid theoretical explorations*Moves away from auteurist approaches, examining work by canonical directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Chris Marker and Agnès Varda alongside that of less well-known filmmakers such as Claire Simon and Yamina Benguigui*Brings together thinkers such as Bergson, Deleuze, Bazin and Barthes with, for example, Rodowick and Mulvey, in an engaging interweaving of theories.Works considered include Jean-Luc Godard's Histoire(s) du Cinéma (1989-98), Yamina Benguigui's Mémoires d'Immigrés (1997), Chris Marker's CD-ROM Immemory (1998), Claire Simon's Mimi (2003), Michael Haneke's Caché (2005) and Agnès Varda's multi-media exhibition, L'Île et Elle (2006).<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r2d19">Democratic Piety</a><br>
  Abstract: In a complex world there is often a tendency to try to make politics as simple as possible. This tendency is evident, for example, in the cases of journalists seeking to explain events and situations to uninitiated recipients, intellectuals in the social sciences trying to identify grand theories that can make sense of a multiplicity of diverse phenomena, and politicians wanting to identify solutions to problems and events so that they will harness electoral support. In all these instances it is possible to identify efforts to explain issues by reducing them to a simplified calculus which then enables the process<br>

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

  Abstract: In an essay published in 1923, Aldous Huxley suggested that ‘of all the various poisons which modern civilization, by a process of autointoxication, brews quietly up within its own bowels, few are more deadly [. . .] than that curious and appalling thing that is technically known as “pleasure”.’² By ‘pleasure’, Huxley here clearly meant something other than simple enjoyment. His use of inverted commas around the word and his description of pleasure as ‘curious and appalling’ signal a profound and significant unease, which I will argue can be fully understood only when considered in relation to Huxley’s sense of<br>

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

  Abstract: When techniques are broadly defined—as process-oriented and involving any systematic and goal-directed human action—one finds them in every creative human activity: in sports, painting, dancing, playing musical instruments, and acting; in physics, chemistry, medicine, and astronomy; in education, administration, and sex. Joseph Agassi argues that magic consists of techniques, though unscientific ones.¹ The swing-era ballad “Oh, Look At Me Now” mentions “technique of kisses.” But techniques can also be much more narrowly defined to include only fully articulated and independently recognized practices that are specifically identified and studied as techniques (the “Alexander technique”).<br>

  Abstract: A long tradition of research, interpretation, and speculation about international politics goes under the name of realism. Although some dispute the pedigree as simply a “construction” of contemporary analysts, in fact a number of writers whose roster includes Machiavelli, Rousseau, Meinecke, von Gentz, Morgenthau, and Waltz, to name just a few, share a number of common themes such as their images of the world, their understanding of historical processes, the dilemmas and paradoxes that are peculiar to states that exist in a condition of anarchy, and the normative primacy of security in such an environment.

  Abstract: Foreign policy analysis (FPA), broadly defined, is a field of study that describes and investigates the structures, processes, and outcomes of the purposeful policy initiatives and responses that are conceived by sovereign political entities and directed toward other political units (not necessarily sovereign states) beyond their borders. The boundaries of the FPA domain are porous and cannot be strictly drawn, and thus it is not uncommon for some of the literature to belong in more than one field of study (e. g., security studies and FPA).

  Abstract: Childless though he was, Immanuel Kant is the towering (or assumed) father of many offspring, one of which is the subject of this book: the theories of democratic peace; those theories that try to explain the absence (or near absence) of war between consolidated democracies. And just as Kant’s hometown of Königsberg changed hands and names throughout its history, so the theories of democratic peace have gone through transformations, assuming different incarnations, or different sorts of idea structures. This book is about the political biography of those theories, and it will analyze the complex sociopolitical process by which they migrated<br>

  Abstract: In 1964 we saw the revival of the Kantian republican peace, and the start of a process that epitomizes the first stage of theory as a hermeneutical process as depicted and analyzed in this book—in other words, the stage when meaning becomes attached to political concepts through academic discourse. A relatively obscure and neglected article by Dean Babst, published in 1964, predated the later flowering of the democratic peace research agenda. Babst’s theoretical observation was revived during the 1970s and 1980s, when a growing number of researchers reaffirmed an interesting empirical phenomenon: that democracies never—or, as the qualified<br>

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Book Title: Archives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memory-Essays from the Sawyer Seminar<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosenberg William G.<br>
  Abstract: As sites of documentary preservation rooted in various national and social contexts, artifacts of culture, and places of uncovering, archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and states, as well as defining memory institutionally within prevailing political systems and cultural norms. By assigning the prerogatives of record keeper to the archivist, whose acquisition policies, finding aids, and various institutionalized predilections mediate between scholarship and information, archives produce knowledge, legitimize political systems, and construct identities. Far from being mere repositories of data, archives actually embody the fragments of culture that endure as signifiers of who we are, and why. The essays in A
      rchives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memoryconceive of archives not simply as historical repositories but as a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.<br>

  Abstract: This essay is about the colonial order of things as seen through its archival productions. It asks what insights about the colonial might be gained from attending not only to colonialism’s archival content but to its particular and sometimes peculiar form. Its focus is on archiving as a process rather than archives as things. It looks to archives as epistemological experiments rather than as sources—to colonial archives as cross-sections of contested knowledge. Most important, I want to suggest that colonial archives were both transparencies on which power relations were inscribed and intricate technologies of rule in themselves. The essay’s<br>

  Abstract: Television archives play a vital role in the day-to-day business of the television industry. They help television makers identify footage and ideas for the programs of tomorrow. Consequently, the archives are organized to support the production process, and any other function is secondary to that objective. At the same time, by default not design, television archives contain the cultural legacy of the twentieth century and play a key role in the infrastructure of modern memory.

  Book Title: Microdramas-Crucibles for Theater and Time<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Muse John H.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Microdramas, John H. Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater.Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamental and about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance.<br>

In the historical development of Sufism, one encounters varied and increasingly sophisticated notions of the mystical path, orṭarīqa. Such a path generally entails that the Sufi aspirant, under the guidance of a spiritual master, follows a practical method of purification and refinement<br>

Using the insightful feminist adage that “the personal is political,” this chapter explores aspects of Ibn ʿArabī’s life and relationships as he presents them, imagining how these experiences created the background against which he received mystical insights and shaped his mystical understandings. For an epistemology of spiritual experience, mystical “openings” occur within a flesh-and-blood person whose personal disposition and<br>

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M.

  Book Title: Moving Consciously-Somatic Transformations through Dance, Yoga, and Touch<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Fraleigh Sondra<br>
  Abstract: The popularity of yoga and Zen meditation has heightened awareness of somatic practices. Individuals develop the conscious embodiment central to somatics work via movement and dance, or through touch from a skilled teacher or therapist often called a somatic bodyworker. Methods of touch and movement foster generative processes of consciousness in order to create a fluid interconnection between sensation, thought, movement, and expression. In Moving Consciously , Sondra Fraleigh gathers essays that probe ideas surrounding embodied knowledge and the conscious embodiment of movement and dance. Using a variety of perspectives on movement and dance somatics, Fraleigh and other contributors draw on scholarship and personal practice to participate in a multifaceted investigation of a thriving worldwide phenomenon. Their goal: to present the mental and physical health benefits of experiencing one's inner world through sensory awareness and movement integration. A stimulating addition to a burgeoning field, Moving Consciously incorporates concepts from East and West into a timely look at life-changing, intertwined practices that involve dance, movement, performance studies, and education.

  Abstract: The study of somatics offers many layers of learning, from the simplest focusing of attention to the cultivation of a deeper sense of self. Somatic study is concerned with experiencing the self from an internal perspective, inviting students to feel, acknowledge, and respond to inner and outer sensations and to consciously participate in attending to, and taking responsibility for, themselves. Developing self-awareness and self-knowledge through somatic processes can allow us to find release, ease, and clarity both physically and emotionally, and can give us choice and freedom to explore new possibilities in our approach to life.<br>

Measuring change for intangible cultural heritage remains a complicated process, but sociolinguists have found ways to address issues of language shift that may contribute helpful models for assessing music shift as well. Without drawing overly strict, problematic parallels between language and music (Tilley 2014, 487), sociolinguistic and other communication-based models can be modified effectively for measuring change in forms of artistic expression. In addition, these approaches highlight key factors related to resilience, thereby providing strategic insights into encouraging<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt1xcmdx">New German Dance Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) HARDT YVONNE<br>
  Abstract: Dance is usually considered the most ephemeral form of art in Western society. This transitory character of dance dominates both historical and contemporary discourse. Nonetheless, historical investigations trace not only the history of dance, but also demonstrate how dance embodies historic and cultural corporealities. Only in more recent years, however, has a focus on history and memory appeared in research on contemporary European concert dance. As Aleida Assmann states, “Today it is most prominently art, which discovers the crisis of memory as its topic and finds new modes in which the dynamic process of cultural memory and forgetting configures.”¹ For<br>

  Abstract: In the process of beginning to work on Harriet Taylor Mill (1807–58) as a thinker, we need to remember not only the details of her personal life, but the time in which she lived and wrote. Insofar as political and social philosophy were concerned, this was a period dominated by Bentham’s utilitarianism and the economics of Ricardo (the latter, work that John Stuart Mill [JSM] did a great deal to both promulgate and criticize).<br>

  Abstract: Accept, to begin, that tradition is the creation of the future out of the past. A continuous process situated in the nothingness of the present, linking the vanished with the unknown, tradition is stopped, parceled, and codified by thinkers who fix upon this aspect or that, in accord with their needs or preoccupations, and leave us with a scatter of apparently contradictory yet cogent definitions. More important, I believe, than erecting and polishing a new definition, which would but stand as a monument to the worries of our unmemorable era, is developing an understanding of the concept in the breadth<br>

  Author(s) EUSTACE NICOLE<br>
  Abstract: From Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke, to Jürgen Habermas, social theorists have long argued that political transformations rest on a foundation of reasoned public critiques. Habermas contended that widespread public debate about—and criticism of—official government policies first developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through a process of rational disputation conducted via the press. For Habermas, emotion had no part to play in this idealized political process. Instead, he applauded “the critical judgment of the public making use of its reason.” From his contemporary eighteenth-century vantage point, Bolingbroke too saw little efficacy in emotion. He famously urged readers<br>

  Abstract: My embroidered works exploit the tensions between copy and original, object and process, and fine art and domestic craft to examine the relations between beauty, value and meaning.

  Abstract: Media and thinking are intimately related. Our memory, perception, and cognition are not just a given, as weightless, immaterial processes taking place purely mentally behind the walls of our skull, but also always already rest on a medial basis. As Nietzsche claims, “Our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts” (Unser Schreibzeug arbeitet mit an unseren Gedanken).¹ From here we can derive the media-philosophical insight that a new medium makes us think differently. Media thus reveal themselves as the body or, better, the different bodies of thought. It is important to note these bodies are not retroactive<br>

  Abstract: The increasing amount of digital projects relating to the field of antiquity is especially promising for the future of traditionally archaic academic fields, including Ancient History, Classics, and Classical Archaeology. An enormous number of fragile, irreplaceable artifacts have survived from antiquity, but only a small number are accessible to the public. The vast majority are housed in storage rooms or isolated collections in museums and universities, as well as private collections around the world.

Take Leibniz’s thought experiment, according to which the order of events is as follows: a random distribution of points exists, and an equation is found, an algorithm, that joins them into a single line. This two-step process implies a third: the elimination of the need for points. In the future, the instantaneously produced, self-consistent line neutralizes time and space.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I tried to show that Modernism in Western literature—and in the New Critical and structuralist hermeneutics to which it gave rise—is grounded in a representational strategy that spatializes the temporal process of existence as being-in-the-world. It is, in other words, a strategy that is subject to a vicious circularity that closes off the phenomenological/existential understanding of the temporal being of existence, and analogously, of the literary text: the sequence of words.

  Abstract: The draft title for this chapter was “What is memory?” Such a title invites a single and univocal definition of the term. Though not involving a logical contradiction, asking what memory is (in singular) may seem at odds with offering to study processes of memory construction, of memories in the plural, and of social disputes over memories, their social legitimacy, and claims to “truth.” This chapter attempts to advance some conceptual issues in order to offer some tools for further analytical and empirical steps.

  Abstract: The relationship between memory and history is nowadays a central preoccupation within several fields of the social sciences. Debates and reflection on the subject are most extensive and intensive within the discipline of history itself, particularly among those scholars who, recognizing that the historian’s craft extends beyond the mere “reconstruction” of what “actually” happened, deploy more complex modes of analysis in their work. An initial complexity emerges from the recognition that what “actually happened” includes the subjective perceptions and experiences of social actors. Furthermore, historical knowledge includes interpretive processes, the construction and selection of the “facts,” and the selection of<br>

  Abstract: Every system of thought traces, as if along a Mobius strip, its own system of unthought, and in the process unfolds a history of alterity that reveals how the other, “at once interior and foreign,” has been provisionally unthought, exteriorized, and “shut away (in order to reduce its otherness).”² Though “shut away,” the other is absolutely integral to the selfsame, a necessary parable (Gr.

I do this primarily through a close analysis of a particular text authored by a former Sri Lankan president whose political career spanned most of the twentieth century, J. R. Jayewardene. If we are the stories we tell about ourselves, Jayewardene’s fable regarding the origins and evolution of Sri Lanka is interesting for the ways in which it produces a sense of identity out of difference.

  Abstract: No comparable civilization has argued over definitions of selfhood as much as the Indian.

There is, however, one point on which all the commentators agree: the self is other than what our faculties persuade us it is. In other words, the construction of the self through social processes (which would require a social other to begin with) is overtaken by a principle in which the “real” or the “true” self comes into being only when it<br>

  Abstract: It is difficult to accurately define the fate Deleuze wished to reserve for what he called the ″image of thought″ if we do not grasp from the outset the profound kinship between image and thought. It is therefore out of the question to deal, on the one hand, with the process of the image and, on the other, with that of thought. There is no dualism that would permit one to posit them each on opposite sides. As we know, Deleuze never begins by positing terms that would be exterior to one another.

  Abstract: In his two cinema books,

Objects, qualities, processes, actions, even the brain: all are images in a dynamic universe of images. In this ″image-world,″ art—specifically, the cinema—emerges as something not ontologically distinct from the rest of the world. Indeed, Deleuze′s theory amounts to the simultaneous dynamization and de-Platonization of the cinema.

  Abstract: Designing architecture is a unique epistemological practice, a unique way of knowing resulting from a complex process of conceptual negotiations. Architects not only solve technical problems and create aesthetic objects but facilitate a process in which visions of a building acquire a particular symbolic or cultural sense. While working on a project, a designer must develop multiple architectural proposals, understand the complexity of issues they manifest, and negotiate them with the parties involved in the project—clients, local authorities, planners, consultants, contractors, bankers, and many others.

  Abstract: In the United States, the field of architecture is in the process of evolving from what has been a practice, informed by other disciplines, into a discipline with its own body of knowledge.¹ Since the nineteenth century, its locus of education has changed from the architecture firm to the higher education institution. Its instructional practices have shifted from a predominantly apprenticeship system to a system of classroom-based teaching supplemented by apprenticeship.

  Abstract: “Labor is the living, form-giving fire,” Marx wrote. “It is the transitoriness of things, their temporality, as their transformation by living time.” How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society? The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

  Abstract: IN THE following pages—perhaps to the surprise or dismay of some of our readers—we will speak not only of labor, exploitation, and capitalism, but also of class conflict, proletarian struggles, and even communist futures. Do dinosaurs still walk the earth?! We cast our discussions in these terms not from obstinacy or any obscure orthodoxy, but simply because we believe that, when submitted to a continual process of reconsideration so as to be in line with our desires and our interpretation of the contemporary world, these are the most useful categories for political and social analysis.<br>

  Abstract: In his 1968 address to the Third Congress of the International Association of Hispanists in Mexico, Fernando Lázaro Carreter (1970, 1972) proposed a review of the concept of “picaresque novel” starting with the “processes of its creation and formation.” Only by carefully establishing (1) the distinctive features outlining the morphology of a literary genre from its very first historical manifestation and (2) its generative power, as manifested by the various transformations giving rise to subsequent imitations, can we actually reach a definition of the genre's dynamic structure—a definition that will in turn make possible the historical ordering of texts<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttsxx">Discourse Analysis as Sociocriticism</a><br>
  Abstract: In Spanish historiography the year 1492 is doubly symbolic, for it coincides not only with the crowning of a long process of national unification, but also with the beginning of Spain’s territorial expansion on a global scale. National unification was consummated with the armed conquest of the last Islamic bastion in Iberian lands, the kingdom of Granada, and the expulsion by decree of the Jews. The territorial expansion that would lead to the annexation of the earldoms of Rosellón and Cerdaña (1493), the occupation of the kingdom of Naples (1503), the conquests of Melilla (1497) and Orán (1509), and other<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttttvf">Notes on Nowhere</a><br>
  Abstract: Traditional utopian literature relates to the novel’s contemporary historical circumstances through a process of negation—contemporary society is present only as a repressed subtext, and visible only in the conceptual “antinomies” that the utopian text attempts to neutralize or resolve. In the previous chapter, I explored the effects that occur when, instead of repressing the connection between contemporary society and imaginary society (a repression that is designed to preserve the absolute “elsewhere” of utopia), a text actively foregrounds and thematizes the interaction between utopia and contemporary society. This increased interaction funds an “ideologeme of activism” within the text, while the<br>

  Chapter 2  The Structure and Formation of Narrative Meaning from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttv4f">Narrative as Communication</a><br>
  Abstract: The several negative definitions of narratology I have given resulted from the mapping of the field proposed early in chapter 1: “(1) the processes by which narrative messages are formed and (2) the functions of such messages”. It should be clear, however, that these two areas represent analytic moments that, considered separately, would be relatively uninteresting. Neither should narratology include in its premises any simple one-way relation between point (1) and (2), which would foreclose the constitution of its object into an instance and/or an image of communication in general. The processes of formation of narrative messages do not determine<br>

  Abstract: At this stage of our inquiry, should we see narrative as a living species, we know probably a bit better how it is built, its anatomy and its locomotion, as well as some aspects of its physiology, but we have formulated only some very general hypotheses about its goals and motivations, its processes of reproduction, and its relations with the environment —“passive” adaptation and “active” modification. In other words, we have left value, demand, work, investment, profit, and interest on our horizon. This does not mean that such notions and, consequently, the metabolism and ecology of the narrative species are<br>

  Abstract: Between the formation/cognition of narrative discourse and the construction of narrative significance, there is still one important mediation to consider: that of genre as technê and sociohistorical constraint. In fact, if we had not taken genre into account, implicitly at least, every time we studied individual examples of acts of narrative communication and their texts, we would have made an intolerable qualitative leap from the level of generality at which our method of analysis was situated to particular concrete situations. The purpose of this chapter is to put genre to work as efficiently as possible within the process of theorization<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttvjt">Architecture's Historical Turn</a><br>
  Abstract: By the early 1960s, a young postwar generation of architects had seized the idea that architecture should participate in the liberation of human experience from the constraints of the social status quo. Raised during the ascendancy of postwar modernism in the West, they viewed its austere institutionalized aesthetics as the emblem of an oppressive and closed social order. They thought individual experience had been impoverished by the process of industrialization and became disillusioned with the modernist faith in technology as the driver of emancipation. In a radical break from modernist ideology, some members of that generation sought to reground the<br>

  Author(s) Lavezzo Kathy<br>
  Abstract: At least since Benedict Anderson breathed new life into the thought of Walter Benjamin, Ernst Renan, and Victor Turner, nationalism has constituted a prominent conceptual feature of contemporary literary and cultural studies. Following the lead of Perry Anderson, Anthony Giddens, and others, academics in English literary studies, by and large, have restricted their analyses to artifacts produced since the late eighteenth century, when the American and French revolutions launched the processes that gave rise to both a modern state founded on popular sovereignty and the appearance in the lexicon of the word “nationalism” (Anderson,

  Abstract: A variety of others have been and are instrumental in the process of forging European identity. From the confrontations with Islam and the Spanish conquest of the “New World” to the scramble for colonial possessions at the end of the nineteenth century and beyond, European historians and philosophers have grappled with the clash between “infidels” or “barbarians” and “civilized” peoples (Harbsmeier 1985). Ethnically and culturally peripheral minorities also serve as internal others. Outstanding historical examples include Jews and Freemasons. The most important contemporary candidates for otherness, arguably, are the postcolonial immigrants from Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) MAUS INGEBORG<br>
  Abstract: Habermas has the avowed intention of (re)formulating Kant’s moral philosophy in terms of discourse theory (
                  Justification, 3). This implies shifting focus away from the philosophy of consciousness, which concentrates on the individual subject, and toward an intersubjective theory. Habermas’s corresponding ethics of discourse replaces Kant’s Categorical Imperative with a process of moral argumentation that gives everyone a procedure for him-or<br>

  Author(s) NUNNER-WINKLER GERTRUD<br>
  Abstract: Behaviorism understands cognitive learning as a cumulative process of forming associations based on the perception of contingencies, and normative learning as a process of adopting desired modes of behavior in response to punishment and reward (that is, as a process of conditioning). From a psychoanalytic perspective, development is a matter of constructing mental patterns on the basis of the relationships experienced in early childhood. Norms are observed because the child wishes to avoid pangs of conscience (i.e., the revenge of the superego, which internalizes the fear of castration); alternatively, this occurs because the structure of biological needs has undergone change<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) EDER KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: The theory of social evolution plays a key role in the foundation of Habermas’s theory of communicative action. Since Marx, the evolutionary perspective has struggled with the fact that the position the observer occupies must necessarily be, at the same time, the endpoint of the process in question—and therefore a point of teleological narrowness restricting the scope of social theory. Over time, this problem has lost none of its actuality for projects that seek to address processes of societal development. Durkheim, for example, was wedded to the model of phase-specific progression as much as, more recently, Parsons, Luhmann, and<br>

  Abstract: For years now—across the continent, in all languages and lands—talk has been animated: Europe must determine what state it finds itself in, whether its legal system may be understood as a constitutional order, whether it can—indeed, should—be democratic, what democracy in a European union means, and what the chances of this really occurring are. The constitutionalization of Europe involves both the analysis of actual processes that make the phenomenon itself comprehensible and a normative framework offering tools of measurement—and specifying conditions necessary—for determining whether the emergent configurations “deserve recognition.” Yet analytical and empirical questions<br>

  Author(s) KREIDE REGINA<br>
  Abstract: For Nietzsche and Sloterdijk, justice is the enemy of freedom. Justice restricts freedom, which they both understand—notwithstanding other differences of opinion—in terms of what affords the greatest possible space for action. For Jürgen Habermas, on the other hand, freedom can only be understood insofar as it is afforded by justice. Without just processes that permit us to determine freedom’s extent and limits, there exists only arbitrary freedom for individuals— but no freedom in the proper sense (freedom for all).<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) DEITELHOFF NICOLE<br>
  Abstract: At its core, “deliberation” refers to processes of argumentation. From the normative perspective that Habermas adopts, deliberative procedures represent a mechanism of legitimate rule (
                     Herrschaft). To be legitimate, such processes of discussion and debate should be public and afford all parties who might potentially be affected by decisions following from them the same opportunities to participate.<br>

  56  EVOLUTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) NEVES MARCELO<br>
  Abstract: Like Talcott Parsons and Niklas Luhmann, Habermas holds that social evolution entails heightened system complexity (
                  Communicative Action,2:155ff.). Unlike his colleagues, however, he affirms that increases in social complexity are mediated by a “developmental logic” whose structure corresponds to the way moral consciousness evolves in stages (esp.Communicative Action, 2:174ff.;Evolution, 69 94, 95 129;Rekonstruktion, 129 143;Moral Consciousness). Contra Luhmann’s (1975, 2003) systems theory, Habermas argues that mounting complexity and the social differentiation that accompanies it depend on “learning mechanisms.” In this sense, his position is that differentiation can represent either “evolutionary processes” or stagnation (Rekonstruktion, 133–134, 230;<br>

  Author(s) HARTMANN MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: The theory of historical materialism developed by Marx and Engels understands social conditions as the result of a teleological historical process. The analysis of operative categories—forces of production, relations of production, and superstructure—permit the further course of history to be explained and even predicted. As outlined in Marx’s
                  Grundrisse(Marx 1993), the model of historical materialism is as follows: Forces of production (i.e., the labor of persons who are active in production, the specialized knowledge that manages/directs their efforts, the tools employed, and instruments/instances of certification and coordination) give rise to institutions and mechanisms that determine who has<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) KREIDE REGINA<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between human rights and democracy is most often described in terms of tension (e.g., Gosepath 1998, 209ff.; Michelman 1999, 52–66; Wellmer 2000). Human rights impose on popular sovereignty moral prescriptions that restrict the freedom of choice and decision. Conversely, the results of democratic processes may run counter to the standing conceptions of human rights—and, as a result, undermine their observance.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) NUNNER-WINKLER GERTRUD<br>
  Abstract: Unlike genetically determined changes that occur in the process of maturation, changes through learning result from experience. By definition, learning processes—because they occur over a longer period of time—are distinct from punctual instances of learning (“imprinting”). As Habermas defines them, they do not refer to the acquisition of motor skills (for example, swimming), simple cultural aptitudes (
                     Kulturtechniken), or narrowly delimited systems of knowledge (for example, reading and writing or mathematical abilities). Instead, learning processes concern the formation of the (cognitive or moral) capacity of judgment.<br>

  Author(s) ISER MATTIAS<br>
  Abstract: The concept of power is of central importance for a critical theory of society. In academic discussions, however, “power” refers to different things. A distinction is often made between theories that focus on “power over” persons or groups and those that speak of “power to” do or achieve something. Habermas’s theory of society seeks both to clarify the connections between the most important—and traditionally competing—conceptions of power and to clarify their normative hierarchy. To this end, he distinguishes between communicative, administrative, and social power. With regard to the legitimacy of political processes, the task involves, above all, determining<br>

  Abstract: Sociological concepts admit analysis along three lines of questioning (Rosa, Strecker, and Kottmann 2007): What

Through what processes and in what manner does societychange? What factors serve as “motors” for transformation? Are there rules underlying its course of development? (Dynamis).

  Book Title: The End of Cinema?-A Medium in Crisis in the Digital Age<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BARNARD TIMOTHY<br>
  Abstract: The authors begin with an overview of the extreme positions held by opposing camps in the debate over cinema: the "digitalphobes" who lament the implosion of cinema and the "digitalphiles" who celebrate its new, vital incarnation. Throughout, they remind readers that cinema has never been a static medium but a series of processes and transformations powering a dynamic art. From their perspective, the digital revolution is the eighth major crisis in the history of motion pictures, with more disruptions to come. Brokering a peace among all sides, Gaudreault and Marion emphasize the cultural practice of cinema over rigid claims on its identity, moving toward a common conception of cinema to better understand where it is headed next.<br>

  Abstract: Some people see the crisis cinema finds itself in the midst of today as a mild foreshadowing of its death, visible on the horizon. The various heralds of the “death” of cinema do not generally believe in its true death, in any real cessation of its vital activity. In the context of the digital turn, the “death” foretold is indicative, rather, of the medium’s decline within the great chorus of media and also of the end of a situation in which cinema exercised an across-the-board hegemony. This is what is in the process of dying, not the medium itself. What<br>

  Abstract: The current transformation of many of our borders into walls is a clear indicator of the ambiguity of the process of globalization, which combines opening and fragmentation, delimitation and closure. This issue places crucial aspects of our humanity at stake since borders and boundaries are linked to the realities of inside and outside, inclusion and exclusion, questions of identity and difference. The current tendency of multiplying strategies for closure reveals that we have significant difficulties when it comes to different ways of configuring everything that has to do with the legal-political realm, citizenship, identity, or security.

  Abstract: Situating Existentialism is a history of the process of systematizing and canonizing existentialism as a movement of thought. As such, it reconstructs a shared dialogue about the human condition in the form of a series of reception histories. But it does so in a somewhat disjointed set of frames, for the process of establishing existentialism as a distinctive brand of theorizing about the human predicament in modernity was welded together only in hindsight.<br>

At the dawn of the twentieth century, none of the standard histories of philosophy—except one by Harald Høffding, who was (predictably enough) then the main Danish thinker of European note—stopped at Kierkegaard’s tomb in their tours of the graveyard of thought, and then only briefly.¹ At<br>

Her most recent work on “post-Christian humanism” overlaps significantly with Richard Kearney’s anatheism.

  Abstract: Stories perform many functions for those who read them and those who write them. In this sense, we should first focus on what makes a story an important model for reflective judgment. I will argue that processes of aesthetic apprehension are created by the work of the productive imagination of some moral experiences. This makes stories important vehicles of reflective judgments. Through their written expression, moral stories have demonstrated that, in spite of many theorists’ skepticism, they capture the “ineffable” characteristics of evil actions.¹ In works of fiction as well as in historical stories about evil acts, the “ineffable” seems<br>

The concepts I have discussed in this book entailed the disclosure of a new way of thinking about politics during the eighteenth century, which transformed the way social agents saw themselves, their experiences, and their future.¹ This process allowed them to imagine concepts such as critique, emancipation, and the political role of civil society as part of negotiating the space between their expectations and their actual political experiences.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: India's imperial elite subtly recast Sikh tradition as a sui generis religion, which robbed its teachings of their political force. In turn, Sikhs began to define themselves as a "nation" and a "world religion" that was separate from, but parallel to, the rise of the Indian state and global Hinduism. Rather than investigate these processes in isolation from Europe, Mandair shifts the focus closer to the political history of ideas, thereby recovering part of Europe's repressed colonial memory.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Bright Intervals: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/nast16744">Contemporary Romanian Cinema</a><br>
  Abstract: For Dina Iordanova, the 1956–1968 period between two revolutions (in Hungary and Prague) coincides with Khrushchevʹs Thaw in Russia and corresponds to a process of liberalisation in terms of themes and style. The transition that ultimately led to the emergence of the 1968 Prague Spring, but was suppressed the same year by the invasion of Warsaw Pact forces, only occurred on a minor scale in Romanian cinema. The recognised and internationally acclaimed New Waves were Polish and Czechoslovak. Important isolated auteurs came from the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania (Iordanova 2003: 9).<br>

  Abstract: Nobody believes anymore in Blanqui’s method of insurrectional revolution. Even liberal capitalism has renounced the coup d’états theorized by Malaparte.¹ There is zero credence in the Marxist idea that changes to the economic infrastructure automatically lead to modifications of ideological superstructures. Collective and violent appropriation of the means of production doesn’t change anything: ideology originates from a logic different from the physiological processes of the modes of production.<br>

  Book Title: Spreading Buddha's Word in East Asia-The Formation and Transformation of the Chinese Buddhist Canon<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yü Chün-fang<br>
  Abstract: The collection undertakes extensive readings of major scriptural catalogs from the early manuscript era as well as major printed editions, including the Kaibao Canon, Qisha Canon, Goryeo Canon, and Taisho Canon. Contributors add fascinating depth to such understudied issues as the historical process of compilation, textual manipulation, physical production and management, sponsorship, the dissemination of various editions, cultic activities surrounding the canon, and the canon's reception in different East Asian societies. The Chinese Buddhist canon is one of the most enduring textual traditions in East Asian religion and culture, and through this exhaustive, multifaceted effort, an essential body of work becomes part of a new, versatile narrative of East Asian Buddhism that has far-reaching implications for world history.<br>

  Abstract: Religião é uma interpretação do mundo e representa uma forma de conhecimento. O filósofo alemão Cassirer parte do pressuposto de que na construção do conhecimento se juntam experiências corporais e processos intelectuais, resultando em formas de estruturação espaçotemporais (1994b, p. 149). Dessa forma, o espaço não representa uma categoria a
                     priori, mas surge, sim,a posteriori, como um entre-espaço da construção mental (consciência) e da apreensão corporal (experiência) (Cassirer, 1994b, p. 74; 1994c, p. 104).<br>

  Abstract: No
                  Projeto de uma psicologia(1895-1950), um dos textos inaugurais da metapsicologia freudiana, Freud propõe que os processos psíquicos inconscientes sejam, em última instância, processos cerebrais e tenta formular uma teoria sobre esses processos em termos neurológicos. Portanto, nesse momento inicial do pensamento freudiano, a metapsicologia é explicitamente uma neuropsicologia. Nos textos metapsicológicos posteriores, essa referência explícita à neurologia desaparece quase completamente, e Freud passa a formular suas teses usando principalmente termos psicológicos. Neste artigo, pretendemos argumentar que, embora a partir deA interpretação dos sonhos(1900) Freud deixe de formular sua teoria metapsicológica em termos predominantemente neurológicos, em nenhum<br>

  Abstract: Fernández organizes episodes in the history of Mexican art and architecture, ranging from the seventeenth century to the end of the twentieth century, around the consistent but unacknowledged historical theme of cosmopolitanism, allowing readers to discern relationships among various historical periods and works that are new and yet simultaneously dependent on their predecessors. She uses case studies of art and architecture produced in response to government commissions to demonstrate that established visual forms and meanings in Mexican art reflect and inform desires, expectations, memories, and ways of being in the world-in short, that visual culture and cosmopolitanism are fundamental to processes of subjectification and identity.<br>

  Abstract: Archaeological remains are more than traces of civilizations past. Like other sites of nation-building they serve as stages for the contestation of multiple interests. Official histories, tourist literature, art history, and archaeology often obscure these tensions by focusing on the impressive materiality of the monuments and on deciphering their original significance (Fig. 4.1). While these efforts illuminate our knowledge of the past, they leave out aggregates of individual and collective experiences that also contribute to the signification of the works. Ancient monuments belong to places. As E. V. Walters argued, the significance of a place is inaccessible through rational processes<br>

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>

  Abstract: Reading the lives of the saints not primarily as historical documents but as iconic expressions of original artworks fashioned by the eucharistic Christ, Astell puts the "faceless" Host in a dynamic relationship with these icons. With the advent of each new spirituality, the Christian idea of beauty expanded to include, first, the marred beauty of the saint and, finally, that of the church torn by division-an anti-aesthetic beauty embracing process, suffering, deformity, and disappearance, as well as the radiant lightness of the resurrected body. This astonishing work of intellectual and religious history is illustrated with telling artistic examples ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to sculptures by Michelangelo and paintings by Salvador Dalí. Astell puts the lives of medieval saints in conversation with modern philosophers as disparate as Simone Weil and G. W. F. Hegel.<br>

McIvor also examines recent, grassroots-organized truth and reconciliation processes such as the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2004-2006), which provided a public examination of the Greensboro Massacre of 1979-a deadly incident involving local members of the Communist Workers Party and the Ku Klux Klan.<br>

They worked within a rights framework but also looked to other disciplines to reimagine the legal entitlements of marginalized people. Litigators developed an argument that the label of mental retardation is a stigma that deprives individuals of their liberty; therefore, the right to due process applies before the label can be assigned.¹ To build this argument, the critics of labeling drew on a theory developed by sociologists and shifted the focus from the deviant person to the process by which<br>

  Book Title: Outlaw Rhetoric-Figuring Vernacular Eloquence in Shakespeare's England<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mann Jenny C.<br>
  Abstract: Outlaw Rhetoricexamines the substantial and largely unexplored archive of vernacular rhetorical guides produced in England between 1500 and 1700. Writers of these guides drew on classical training as they translated Greek and Latin figures of speech into an everyday English that could serve the ends of literary and national invention. In the process, however, they confronted aspects of rhetoric that run counter to its civilizing impulse. For instance, Mann finds repeated references to Robin Hood, indicating an ongoing concern that vernacular rhetoric is "outlaw" to the classical tradition because it is common, popular, and ephemeral. As this book shows, however, such allusions hint at a growing acceptance of the nonclassical along with a new esteem for literary production that can be identified as native to England. Working across a range of genres, Mann demonstrates the effects of this tension between classical rhetoric and English outlawry in works by Spenser, Shakespeare, Sidney, Jonson, and Cavendish. In so doing she reveals the political stakes of the vernacular rhetorical project in the age of Shakespeare.<br>

  Author(s) Johnson Valerie B.<br>
  Abstract: This essay applies ecocriticism to the study of neomedieval texts, an approach that I term “ecomedievalism.” Ecomedievalism interlaces study of neomedievalisms through the bifurcated lens of ecocriticism and ecomaterialism.¹ Neomedieval texts continually deploy environmental descriptions and language to develop a sense of an authentic medieval setting, part of the worldbuilding process, yet little critical attention is devoted to analyzing these methods from an ecological perspective. Ecocriticism’s rapid theorization has allowed the field to move beyond the political activism that characterized its origins, and now offers an opportunity to begin academic study of the fictional environments in neomedievalisms.² Consequently, this essay<br>

  Author(s) Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: The condition of German literature and its place and function in society was one of Herder’s major concerns. He thought of “literature” in an older, more comprehensive sense: It included, in addition to poetry, all types of prose writing, not only drama and fiction, but also biographies and memoirs, historiography, essays on all topics of general interest including science, and last but not least writings in the area of theology and religion, from church hymns and sermons to edifying and scholarly treatises.

  Author(s) Menze Ernest A.<br>
  Abstract: The study of the reception of and influences on literature is relatively new and, for the works of many authors, has hardly begun. Current literature tends to receive the most attention. In the past, literary works were often co-opted for ideological reasons and in the process misinterpreted and distorted; this was the case with Johann Gottfried Herder through the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century. Ultimately, Herder was discredited by nationalist perversion of his works during the National-Socialist era. Whereas there are several studies dealing with Herder’s early-twentieth-century reception history, little has been done regarding Herder’s influence in earlier<br>

  Abstract: Historians of the modern and pre-modern worlds have often sought to make connections between the boundaries of states and the shape of their respective historiographies; in recent years they have scrutinised archival processes and the preservation of artefacts of the past, and they and their literary peers have examined the historical narratives which imposed order on the past and gave meaning to its remains.¹ National historiographies are thus commonly ascribed active properties, as means by which elites might recognise and realise a collective future for their nation, stifle opposing views and assert a common will.

  Book Title: Middle English Romance and the Craft of Memory-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): McKINSTRY JAMIE<br>
  Abstract: In Middle English romances many memories are created, stored, forgotten, and rediscovered by both the characters and audience; such memory work is not, however, either simple or obvious. This study examines the ways in which recollection is achieved and sustained through physical, cognitive, and interpretative challenges. It uses examples such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sir Orfeo, and Emaré, alongside romances by Chaucer and Malory, to investigate the genre's reliance on individual and collective memorial processes. The author argues that a tale's objects, places, dreams, discoveries, disguises, prophecies, and dramatic ironies influence that romance's essential memory work, which relies as much on creativity as it does accuracy. He also explores the imaginative crafts of memory that are employed by romances themselves. Dr Jamie McKinstry teaches in the Department of English Studies at Durham University, where he is a member of the Institute of Medieval and Early Modern Studies.<br>

  1  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt17mvhj3">Middle English Romance and the Craft of Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: Why, indeed, is memory important in medieval romances? This question needs clarification given the many associations and definitions of such a complex cognitive faculty as memory, and the equally wide-ranging scope of this particular literary genre. We should begin by considering what exactly we mean by “memory,” which can be both individual, relating to the thought processes of a single remembering subject, and also collective. To take examples from the romance genre itself, a single knight might be trying desperately to maintain the memory of his love whilst away from home for many years. This is his individual memorial challenge.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt17mvhj3">Middle English Romance and the Craft of Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter it became clear that the remembering subject must be willing to perform memory work in order for the process of recollection to be successful. This was examined in terms of voluntary intellection and, in a medieval romance, such a journey into memory must begin in order for the current romance to exist at all. As was discussed in the Introduction, romances are glittering examples of a golden age of the past and the sense of “looking back” is encoded in the narratives’ use of past places and literary analogues. We are always still very much in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt17mvhj3">Middle English Romance and the Craft of Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter it was argued that romances frequently contain memories of other tales, even other versions of the same narrative, which are there for the audience to identify and then apply to the current tale. The process demands careful cognitive effort and also a great deal of creative freedom which is, as was explored in the discussion of classical and medieval theories, at the very centre of medieval

  Abstract: In the previous chapter memory and recollection were instrumental in directing a character’s experience and in shaping the greater theme or moral developed during the course of a tale. Yet, given the creative freedom invited during the process of recollection, memory was never restrictive or overly controlling in the narrative. Rather, characters and the audience retained the free will inherent in voluntary intellection (as was discussed in Chapter 2) which allowed them to choose and recollect in their own way and, to a certain extent, at their own pace. Materials were presented which

  Abstract: Throughout this study two rules have emerged regarding the process of recollection: firstly, that the past is crucial in shaping responses to a present situation and, secondly, in order for any recollection to be successful,
                  thatpast must be crafted to fit with a current set of circumstances. Certain characters in the previous chapter deliberately denied any such opportunities by imposing boundaries between the present and “true” past or restricting the creative opportunities that were available to form a reconnection with the past. However, when we talk of adapting the present in line with the past, the silent understanding is<br>

  Conclusion: from:

  Abstract: This study has asserted that memory (and its associated cognitive and interpretative processes) is essential to a romance’s success as morally satisfying, entertaining, and challenging literature. Moreover, the role of memory can change according to the aesthetics and aims of a particular tale. Consequently, the faculty occupies a prominent role across the romance genre in narratives that are, variously, courtly and complex, metrical and local, or Arthurian and legendary. Memory, as had become abundantly clear, serves an essential, practical function in

  Abstract: Nations in the South Pacific face the dramatic dual pressures of local reinventions and global engagements over processes of political decolonisation (both external and internal), cultural revitalisation and economic development.

  Abstract: Conceptualisations of heritage have become complex in recent years. Though traditionally understood within conservationist paradigms and, therefore, primarily concerned with the preservation of objects, buildings and other tangible articles, heritage is now understood as more of a process whereby heritage is not the object itself but the wide range of values and interpretations that are ascribed to objects, rituals and traditions, to name but a few (Ashworth 2008; Smith 2006; Tunbridge

Whereas some of these concerns, and the debates they have generated, have been geared toward resolving ontological and epistemological dilemmas, others have focused on methodological challenges of the process of social enquiry.¹ This concern forms my examination of the hermeneutical analysis of social phenomenon such as the narratives about the idea and practices of the “nation.” Using interpretive theory, or hermeneutics, this chapter explores how interpreting ideology as “meaning in the service of power” illuminates the analysis of media<br>

However, by the 1940s and 1950s, it was evident that ethnicity in general and the struggle for the accommodation of the many ethnic nations within Nigeria would pose a major challenge to the process of nation-building. It was precisely at this point, particularly during the June 1957 London Conference on the Nigerian (Independence) Constitution, that the three dominant ethnic groups were struggling to gain advantage over one another and that ethnic minorities made it clear they would not be “pacified by the<br>

  Book Title: Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega-Masters of Parody<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KERR LINDSAY G.<br>
  Abstract: Co-Winner of the 2014 Publication Prize awarded by the Association of Hispanists of Great Britain and Ireland Kerr traces the processes and paradoxes at work in the late parodic poetry of Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega, illuminating the correlations and connections between two poets who have more often than not been presented as enemies.The analysis follows the parallel development of the complex parodic genre through Góngora's late mythological parody, from his 1589 Hero and Leander romance through to his culminating parody, La fábula de Píramo y Tisbe (1618) and Lope de Vega's alter ego Tomé de Burguillos, whose anthology, Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos, was published a year before Lope's death, in 1634. Working from the premise that parody provides a Derridean supplément to exhausted, dominant genres (e.g. pastoral, lyric, epic), this study asks: what do these texts achieve by their supplementarity, and how do they achieve it?, and, the overarching question, why do these erudite poets turn to parody in an age of decline?

For Góngora in these ludic and occasionally vulgarletrillas, the space between signifier and signified is where play is king, where, amid the disguises and misdirections, truths<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt1t6p5zq">Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega</a><br>
  Abstract: The parodic poetry written by Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega at the end of their professional careers and in the winter of their years unquestionably brings forth something new, built from the bricks of ancient and contemporary poetic monuments. These poets utilise parody as a process that, paradoxically, ends and begins simultaneously in order to engage with the literary past, question its legacy, and redirect future poetics. Góngora’s mytho-parodic trajectory and comic culmination, and Lope’s final theatrical extravaganza as Tomé de Burguillos, reveal a wealth of common practices. Primarily, against the traditional critical tendency to pit our authors<br>

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world.

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century.

  Book Title: Medievalist Enlightenment-From Charles Perrault to Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: Literary medievalism played a vital role in the construction of the French Enlightenment. Starting with the Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns, it influenced movements leading to the Romantic rediscovery of the Middle Ages, and helped to shape new literary genres, from the epistolary novel to the fairy tale and opera. Indeed, the dominant mode of the early Enlightenment, 'galanterie', was of medievalist inspiration. Moreover, the academic study of medieval texts underlay modern ideals of scholarship, institutionalized at the royal academies. The Middle Ages polemically functioned as an alternative site, allowing authors to rethink their age's political and social ideologies. At the centre of these debates was the notion of historical progress. Was progress possible, as the 'philosophes' held, or was human history a process of degeneration, with the Middle Ages as a lost Golden Age? From the re-evaluation of the medieval thus emerged not only the seeds of a new poetics, but also the central questions that preoccupied Enlightenment thinkers from Montesquieu to Rousseau. This book shows how, in order to understand the aesthetic and intellectual transformations that marked modernity, it is essential to examine how this period conceived of the past, and particularly those "Dark Ages" that served as the defining foil for the modern Age of Light.

  Abstract: This chapter examines how out of the

This new, academic medievalism had its institutional basis at the Académie royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Originally founded by Louis XIV to compose Latin commemorative inscriptions in his honour, during the eighteenth century the Academy evolved into a full-fledged scholarly body, focusing more exclusively on historical and philological activities, and shifting its emphasis from classical to medieval subjects.

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Abstract: The mass suicide and murder of the men, women and children of the Jewish community in York on 16 March 1190 is one of the most scarring events in the history of Anglo-Judaism, and an aspect of England's medieval past which is widely remembered around the world. However, the York massacre was in fact only one of a series of attacks on communities of Jews across England in 1189-90; they were violent expressions of wider new constructs of the nature of Christian and Jewish communities, and the targeted outcries of local townspeople, whose emerging urban politics were enmeshed within the swiftly developing structures of royal government. This new collection considers the massacre as central to the narrative of English and Jewish history around 1200. Its chapters broaden the contexts within which the narrative is usually considered and explore how a narrative of events in 1190 was built up, both at the time and in following years. They also focus on two main strands: the role of narrative in shaping events and their subsequent perception; and the degree of 'convivencia' between Jews and Christians and consideration of the circumstances and processes through which neighbours became enemies and victims.

  Author(s) De Visscher Eva<br>
  Abstract: An increasing emphasis on the otherness of the Jews in twelfth- and thirteenth-century ecclesiastical sources seems to coincide with a revival of the study of Hebrew among Christian scholars. While this revival, which forms part of a wider intensification of interest in language, rhetoric and the study of the biblical text, is visible all over Western Europe, scholars and texts of English origin are particularly well-represented in the extant source material.¹ This chapter focuses on the learning process involved in this type of cross-religious language acquisition. Examining Hebrew and Hebraist texts from pre-expulsion England, it aims to reconstruct, in so<br>

  Author(s) Bradbury Carlee A.<br>
  Abstract: Before and after the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290, artists made and audiences understood pictured Jews as embodiments of opposition to the Christian norm, as the quintessential other. Such visual dehumanization of the Jew has been widely considered elsewhere,¹ so this essay will focus on one topos that recurs at York: the Jew in visualizations of the Funeral of the Virgin. Both the textual and visual narratives of this tale depend on the moment when a Jew tries to overturn the platform on which Maryʹs body is being carried during her burial procession.

  Author(s) Horning Audrey<br>
  Abstract: Public and community archaeologies clearly have their deepest roots in places characterised by structural, societal inequities, and in situations where archaeologists have sought to be inclusive. As such, community archaeology has been generally theorised within a postcolonial, post-processual framework whereby we as scholars and trained professionals question our own position and our right to talk about the past of ‘other people’, often disenfranchised people. As characterised by Gemma Tully, the principal rationale for community archaeology is that ‘better archaeology can be achieved when more diverse voices are involved in the interpretation of the past.’¹ The best of these new inclusive<br>

  Book Title: Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age-Eros, Eris and Empire<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: This work engages with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial 'home' space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet's sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. But the primary commitment of the book is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Góngora and Quevedo), this study disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the 'epistemic break', often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation.

  Abstract: As we have seen, there has been a proliferation of the use of intertextuality in recent Cuban fiction, and the process of creation appears as a topic in all the novels studied in this book. This process of creation becomes a mechanism that the characters of the novels use to reach self–knowledge, as a way of creating a collective memory and of resisting established authority.<br>

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  Abstract: By establishing a principle of identity between Berg and Wagner, this chapter is bound to cause suspicion, as it could rightly be argued that a person’s identity is formed by a multitude of factors—including the appropriation of historical or fictional narratives—by which the individual and collective identities are in a constant process of reconfiguration. To single out one element as
                  themost important factor in the formation of one’s identity would seem to establish a rather rigid category that overlooks other relational properties in identity formation. To be sure, as is well-known, Berg identified himself overtly with an<br>

  Abstract: In the conclusion of

Perhaps the most significant aspect of this ending is that Berg places Lulu’s death offstage; the only victim onstage, and therefore seen and heard by the audience, is Geschwitz. Berg even considered, at some point during the compositional process, leaving Lulu alive, making Geschwitz the only fatal victim of Jack the Ripper.¹ This subtle<br>

  Abstract: Ludwig Feuerbach was born in Landshut, Bavaria, in 1804. His father was a politically liberal jurist of international renown; one of Ludwig’s brothers, Karl Wilhelm, would make a name for himself in mathematics; and one of his nephews, Anselm, was to become a famous painter. In 1823, Feuerbach started studying theology in Heidelberg, where, through the teaching of Karl Daub, he became an enthusiastic adherent of Hegelianism. After two semesters, he moved to Berlin to study with Hegel himself, switching from theology to philosophy in the process. He completed his studies at the University of Erlangen in 1828 with a<br>

  Abstract: If poetry plays to the most volatile and malleable part of our nature, then Plato, the philosopher, played poetry beautifully, and at its own game. The exploratory nature of Plato’s writings, as well as their apparent inconsistencies, are well documented.¹ His contradictory attitude, for instance, to poetry’s relationship to the polity has not only dogged disciplinary discourse in terms of a centuries-long quarrel between philosophy and literature, but has also given rise to a provocative paradigm that connects order within the self to the construction of a utopian state. Individual selfhood is symbolically politicised in this process, while the construction<br>

Even its attempts to proceed with caution, entrusting history to the guidance of reason, all too often misfire, for what does reason have to say about where we should be headed?

  Abstract: According to Schmidt, 
                  Zettel’s Traum borrows its “SpaltenTechnick” from Finnegans Wake. By structuring Zettel’s Traum into three columns or “TextSträhnen,” Schmidt expects that the reader will be able to follow the information provided in the columns.¹ To ease the reading process, Schmidt divides the three columns according to theme. The center column reflects the events of the years between 1965 and 1969, the time frame in which Zettel’s Traum was actually written. Daniel Pagenstecher, as the central narrator of the events, assists Paul and Wilma Jacobi, likewise writers and old school friends, in the translation of Poe’s works into German.<br>

  Abstract: An analysis of Schmidt’s dialectic of conscious and unconscious thought processes remains insufficient without a more thorough investigation of Schmidt’s understanding of subjectivity. An inquiry into what constitutes subjectivity seems even more necessary since Schmidt alludes to the androgynous character of our being. Schmidt’s stress on the unconscious as the prime determinant of our conscious mode of processing information unveils the central role the unconscious assumes in any reflection on subjectivity. Throughout the previous chapters, however, I emphasized that reading entails a process of decipherment, which in turn always leads to a process of construction and reconstruction.

This particular flow of people and culture was fueled by a social imagination that understood the other shores of the Atlantic as a sort of homeland. One homeland did not rule out the other, however. The Lagosians in nineteenth-century Cuba and the Aguda in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Lagos understood their identities as diasporic, as fluid, and as belonging to the processes of journey and relocation.

  Abstract: In the last quarter of the twentieth century English-Canadian literature has firmly established itself on the international stage — above all in the novel and short-story genre. The production and reception of a national Canadian literature gained significant impetus during the 1960s and 1970s. The process of maturity for Canadian literature was greatly influenced by the cultural atmosphere surrounding the centenary of the Canadian Confederation in 1967, but the process itself had begun much earlier, as is indicated by the active support for Canadian literature by the Canada Council for the Arts from the late 1950s onwards.

  Abstract: For Daphne Marlatt’s 1988 book 
                  Ana Historic, Lewis Carroll’s writings are also important subtexts as they question conventions and playfully illustrate that what is real depends on cultural frameworks and individual perspective. As another contemporary Canadian woman writer who breaks down linguistic and narrative structures, Marlatt seems to share a lot of Audrey Thomas’s aims and strategies. Like Thomas, Marlatt disrupts surface structures to defamiliarize accepted notions of femininity and to question the coherence and continuity of gender and sexual identity. Both authors mirror the process of identity (de)formation in the narratives of their protagonists who are both writers themselves.<br>

  Book Title: Fighting For Time-Shifting Boundaries of Work and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Kalleberg Arne L.<br>
  Abstract: Though there are still just twenty-four hours in a day, society’s idea of who should be doing what and when has shifted. Time, the ultimate scarce resource, has become an increasingly contested battle zone in American life, with work, family, and personal obligations pulling individuals in conflicting directions. In Fighting for Time, editors Cynthia Fuchs Epstein and Arne Kalleberg bring together a team of distinguished sociologists and management analysts to examine the social construction of time and its importance in American culture. Fighting for Time opens with an exploration of changes in time spent at work—both when people are on the job and the number of hours they spend there—and the consequences of those changes for individuals and families. Contributors Jerry Jacobs and Kathleen Gerson find that the relative constancy of the average workweek in America over the last thirty years hides the fact that blue-collar workers are putting in fewer hours while more educated white-collar workers are putting in more. Rudy Fenwick and Mark Tausig look at the effect of nonstandard schedules on workers’ health and family life. They find that working unconventional hours can increase family stress, but that control over one’s work schedule improves family, social, and health outcomes for workers. The book then turns to an examination of how time influences the organization and control of work. The British insurance company studied by David Collinson and Margaret Collinson is an example of a culture where employees are judged on the number of hours they work rather than on their productivity. There, managers are under intense pressure not to take legally guaranteed parental leave, and clocks are banned from the office walls so that employees will work without regard to the time. In the book’s final section, the contributors examine how time can have different meanings for men and women. Cynthia Fuchs Epstein points out that professional women and stay-at-home fathers face social disapproval for spending too much time on activities that do not conform to socially prescribed gender roles—men are mocked by coworkers for taking paternity leave, while working mothers are chastised for leaving their children to the care of others. Fighting for Time challenges assumptions about the relationship between time and work, revealing that time is a fluid concept that derives its importance from cultural attitudes, social psychological processes, and the exercise of power. Its insight will be of interest to sociologists, economists, social psychologists, business leaders, and anyone interested in the work-life balance.<br>

  Abstract: Social scientists have been “worrying about social change,” as Charles Tilly puts it (1983, p.1), since the emergence of the various disciplines in the nineteenth century. The enduring concern to understand the roots and consequences of the industrial revolution has certainly not been misplaced. Yet sociologists, even more than other social scientists, have labored under serious misconceptions. All too often, according to Tilly (1983, p. 6), sociologists have assumed that “ ‘social change’ is a coherent general phenomenon, explicable

  Book Title: Bones of Contention-The living archive of Vasil Levski and the making of Bulgaria's national hero<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
  Abstract: This book is about documenting and analyzing the living archive around the figure of Vasil Levski (1837–1873), arguably the major and only uncontested hero of the Bulgarian national pantheon. The processes described, although with a chronological depth of almost two centuries, are still very much in the making, and the living archive expands not only in size but constantly adding surprising new forms. The monograph is a historical study, taking as its narrative focus the life, death and posthumous fate of Levski. By exploring the vicissitudes of his heroicization, glorification, appropriations, reinterpretation, commemoration and, finally, canonization, it seeks to engage in several broad theoretical debates, and provide the basis for subsequent regional comparative research. The analysis of Levski's consecutive and simultaneous appropriations by different social platforms, political parties, secular and religious institutions, ideologies, professional groups, and individuals, demonstrates how boundaries within the framework of the nation are negotiated around accepted national symbols.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt128245">Bones of Contention</a><br>
  Abstract: This book is about documenting and analyzing the living archive around the figure of Vasil Levski, arguably the major and only uncontested hero of the Bulgarian national pantheon. In the course of working on the problem, it became clear that this cannot be a finite task. The processes described, although with a chronological depth of almost two centuries, are still very much in the making, and the living archive expands not only in size but constantly adds surprising new forms. While archives continue to occupy an almost sacral place both in the public imagination (as the repositories of truth) as<br>

  1.  A “Social Drama” at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt128245">Bones of Contention</a><br>
  Abstract: Social dramas, as Victor Turner describes them, are “in large measure political processes, that is, they involve competition for scarce ends—power, dignity, prestige, honor, purity—by particular means and by the utilization of resources that are also scarce—goods, territory, money, men and women. Ends, means, and resources are caught up in an interdependent feedback process.”
                  12What is significant is Turner’s insistence that social dramas are not merely a representation (oral or written) of discord or conflict in society, and as such only a story with its “discernible inaugural, transitional, and terminal motifs” to use Hayden White’s terminology.13For<br>

  Book Title: Late Enlightenment-Emergence of the Modern 'National Idea'<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kopeček Michal<br>
  Abstract: This volume represents the first in a four-volume series , a daring project by CEU Press which presents the most important texts that triggered and shaped the processes of nation-building in the many countries of Central and Southeast Europe. The series brings together scholars from Austria, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, the Republic of Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey. The editors have created a new interpretative synthesis that challenges the self-centered and "isolationist" historical narratives and educational canons prevalent in the region, in the spirit of of "coming to terms with the past."<br>

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

  Abstract: On July 6, 1995, a monument of Bulgarian statesman Stefan Stambolov—representing only his head with a deep cut on it—was inaugurated in the garden in front of the Army Club in Sofia, on the spot where he was murdered 100 years before. Insofar as Stambolov had become a symbol of independent national policies, directed against Russia in particular, the newly restored democracy in Bulgaria marked its exit from the Soviet sphere of influence with this monument. The irony is that by vindicating Stambolov, in fact, by giving official sanction to a process that had begun already under communism,<br>

  Book Title: Remembering Communism-Private and Public Recollections of Lived Experience in Southeast Europe<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Troebst Stefan<br>
  Abstract: Remembering Communism examines the formation and transformation of the memory of communism in the post-communist period. The majority of the articles focus on memory practices in the post-Stalinist era in Bulgaria and Romania, with occasional references to the cases of Poland and the GDR. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, including history, anthropology, cultural studies and sociology, the volume examines the mechanisms and processes that influence, determine and mint the private and public memory of communism in the post-1989 era. The common denominator to all essays is the emphasis on the process of remembering in the present, and the modalities by means of which the present perspective shapes processes of remembering, including practices of commemoration and representation of the past.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt1287c4v">Remembering Communism</a><br>
  Author(s) Kabakchieva Petya<br>
  Abstract: This chapter begins with a few words on the evolution of the historiographical interpretations of the socialist era in Bulgaria. The shift occurred almost immediately after 1989. Unlike some other socialist countries in Eastern Europe, in Bulgaria “the changes” were not the result of a “people’s revolution” but rather “a palace coup,” whereby the pro-Gorbachev group in the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party forced Todor Zhivkov to resign.¹ As a result, the transition process developed more slowly. Still, the reinterpretation of the recent past started on an absolutely negative note: all newspapers (even before<br>

  Author(s) Kirilova Anny<br>
  Abstract: Adoption is a sore subject, much discussed and debated in present-day Bulgaria. Under socialism, it was a state policy, not subject to public deliberation. Until a decade ago, the ethnological interpretation of adoption was limited to traditional societal norms and perceptions. It was my personal involvement in this process, as well as the lack of serious sociological studies on the socialist period, that engaged my scholarly interest to the topic.<br>

  Abstract: In my study, I have tried to overcome the one-sided image of communism/socialism in Bulgaria. I hope that it answers some of the critical questions about the development of Bulgarian society in the twentieth century, and that it presents a complex picture of both peasants and workers in the region of Pernik at that time, in particular with regard to the problems of economic and social modernization of Bulgarian society in the period of communism/socialism. The social inequalities between peasants and workers, the focus on industrialization and massive migration to the town—a process typical for the whole communist period<br>

  Abstract: Immediately after 1989, our past became more and more unpredictable. At the time, I did not realize how accurate this famous phrase would continue to be two decades later. Although I had been working on the problematic of collective memory for some time, I could not have imagined that the efforts of a group of politicians and historians (the European People’s Party, Stéphane Courtois, and others), who strove to legalize the formula “communism is a regime more perverse than Nazism” in the process of lobbying for Resolution 1481 of the PACE (January 2006), would not be discussed by Bulgarian historians,<br>

  Author(s) Kalinova Evgenia<br>
  Abstract: The euphemistically called “revival process,” that is, the policy of the Bulgarian Communist Party aiming at ethnic assimilation of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria in the second half of the 1980s, has been in the scope of my research interests as an important part of contemporary Bulgarian history which I teach at the University of Sofia. At the same time, I have always been aware that the “revival process,” even though it ended in December 1989, is still present as a painful memory. When discussing the problem with my students, I observed that their reactions most often were purely emotional<br>

  Book Title: Remembrance, History, and Justice-Coming to terms with traumatic pasts in democratic societies<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Iacob Bogdan C.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has left behind a painful and complicated legacy of massive trauma, monstrous crimes, radical social engineering, or collective/individual guilt syndromes that were often the premises for and the specters haunting the process of democratization in the various societies that emerged out of these profoundly de-structuring contexts. The present manuscript is a state of the art reassessment and analysis of how the interplay between memory, history, and justice generates insight that is multifariously relevant for comprehending the present and future of democracy without becoming limited to a Europe-centric framework of understanding. The manuscript is structured on three complementary and interconnected trajectories: the public use of history, politics of memory, and transitional justice. Key words 1.

  Author(s) Langenbacher Eric<br>
  Abstract: Over the last decade and a half, academic attention has grown considerably in two closely related yet rarely connected areas. On the one hand, the field of transitional justice has looked at the importance of various judicial, bureaucratic (lustration) and political (truth and reconciliation commissions) processes aimed at confronting legacies of authoritarian persecution and repression. Authors often contest the overriding goals of such measures, yet most agree on the importance of providing a modicum of justice for those who suffered previously, as well as prospectively rebuilding social and political trust and legitimacy in the new liberalized and/or democratic order.

  Author(s) Gussi Alexandru<br>
  Abstract: Over the past twenty-five years, the debate about the communist past in Eastern Europe became largely a discussion about the debate itself. In this chapter, I will argue that, in the immediate aftermath of the events of 1989, the main concern of the public actors was not to clarify the nature of the old regime, but to assess its specific elements, to condemn and/or to forget them. Such processes were perceived to be the perquisites of embarking on the project of building a new democratic state.<br>

  Abstract: Trials against former leaders of a dictatorial regime are symbolic moments in the founding of a new political order. Beyond the classic functions of criminal justice (punishing the guilty, preventing similar deeds in the future and reinforcing respect for the law), these trials can also play an epistemic role in societies in transition.¹ They constitute important processes of narrative construction, understood as “storytelling” (
                  mise en récit) about injustice. The selection of the relevant facts at the trial, their legal characterization, and the assignation of blame by sentencing may constitute public affirmations of an official and normative version of events,² which<br>

  Abstract: The death of Slobodan Milošević, on March 11, 2006, in the detention unit of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) put an abrupt end to yet another process dubbed as “the trial of the century.” Three days later the Trial Chamber took notice of the death of the accused, hence terminating the case IT-02-54 that dragged on for more than four years toward its anticlimactic end. Disappointment among the interested parties was as deep as the earlier feeling of success upon his bringing to justice. “I deeply regret the death of Slobodan Milošević. It deprives the victims<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

In this brief coda, the attempt will be made to view them from a different perspective, not as solutions but as problems. The process of hybridization, it was suggested earlier, may be conscious or unconscious. On the other hand, opposition to the process is necessarily conscious, whether it takes the weaker form of resistance or the stronger form of a<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapters sought to demonstrate that—despite lawyers’ intellectual reflexes—accounts of the past, history, and traditions are not hard facts to be taken at face value. Rather, accounts of the past (historical narratives) are the outcome of processes of interpretation. Lawyers’ accounts of the past as presented in constitutional cases are as interpretive as any other historical narrative. The last of these concerns relates closely to a court’s justification for selecting particular segments of the past for the purposes of settling a constitutional problem. When invoked in constitutional cases, arguments from history and traditions are presented as if<br>

The defining twentieth-century struggle—between liberal democracies with their apparently superior market economies and authoritarian communist regimes with their ossifying and crumbling command economies—came to a sudden and unexpected demise. The former emperors of the Soviet Bloc were left shivering and cold in their newly-revealed nakedness; the vast political and security apparatus of the party-state crumbled like a house of cards.

Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

But these are ungenerous caveats: this is a meticulously researched study in which analysis is ably supported by a range of impres- sive statistical data and well-chosen (and sometimes entertaining) case studies of individual readers, pub- lishers, and publications. ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor.

In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors.

Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary.

This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read.

The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992).

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V.

The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996).

In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Author(s): Walton Heather,<br>
Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Abstract: In sum: while it has it flaws, this book is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the field of theories of religion around. It is worth the cover price for that alone, which makes it definitely recommendable. Those who want to learn about the current state of theory, especially if they tend in the realist direction, will find this book very useful. Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

They are indispensable readings for students of political philosophy in their examination of transcendence, philosophy, and politics. By seeing Voegelin as a postmodern thinker and by showing his exchange with Strauss, both of these books provide us with a broader context to understand Voegelin's political philosophy. As part of the University of Missouri Press' new series, bothFaith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsprovide intellectually provocative and serious-minded secondary works on Eric Voegelin and his ultimate place in political philosophy.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Author(s): Valéry Paul<br>
Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: Culture has been regarded as an anathema to psychology as an empiricist research tradition. Despite the explosive growth of research on culture and psychology over the last decade of the 20
         thcentury and its importance in Asian social psychology, the ontological and epistemological tension between psychology as a science and psychology as a cultural/historical discipline introduced in the writings of the thinkers of the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment still lingers on in the contemporary discourse of psychology. Clifford Geertz once ominously suggested that cultural psychology may have chewed more than it can. In this paper, the interpretive turn in social science as exemplified by writings of Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur is reviewed and discussed how it may impinge on the practice of Asian social psychology as an empirical science in methodological, epistemological, and ontological respects. It is argued here that the current practice of Asian social psychology is largely, though not entirely, free of the challenges mounted by these theorists, and that Asian social psychology has an advantage of not encumbered by this traditional tension due to a monist ontology that is prevalent in Asia.<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Abstract: Using data from an ethnographic study of
         tarot divination, occult claims to knowledge are analyzed and interpreted. Attention is focused on theproceduresparties to occult divination employ to claim and sustain what they regard as extraordinary knowledge. This view of occult knowledge stands opposed to efforts to discredit occult claims as unscientific or the result of psychosocial conditions like deprivation and marginality. Like knowledge in general, occult knowledge is a product of sociohistorical influences, interactional negotiation, and interpretation. The challenge for sociology therefore is the pursuit of the social interactional and historical processes whereby knowledge and interpretation are accomplished in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: Research on identity suggests that a critical factor in identity concerns presentation or the behaviors actors perform in order to convince others of their identity. Yet identity also involves the attributions others make on the basis of these behaviors. In this paper, I argue that all acts do not fare equally in the process of attribution. Rather, individuals making attributions engage in a process of mental weighing as a way to determine which acts “count” toward identity and to what extent. While various components of the act contribute to its social weight—its presence or absence, markedness, frequency, context, and the manner in which it is performed—the lens through which the attributer views the act also influences the weighing process.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Abstract: The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on “detainee abuse” at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) “constructionist analytics,” I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that “really occurred” throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems.<br>

Abstract: Although research on teacher cognition is no longer in its infancy, it has largely failed to affect the ways in which programs and teachers are evaluated. In accordance with what Raths and Katz (1985) call the Goldilocks Principle, the notion of teacher cognition may simply be "too big" (too general and vague) for mundane application. This review was designed to compare alternative approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition and to consider ways in which the literature of this subfield may be discouraging its application. Teacher cognition is defined as pre- or inservice teachers' self-reflections; beliefs and knowledge about teaching, students, and content; and awareness of problem-solving strategies endemic to classroom teaching. This paper describes and critiques five different approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition: (a) direct and noninferential ways of assessing teacher belief, (b) methods that rely on contextual analyses of teachers' descriptive language, (c) taxonomies for assessing self-reflection and metacognition, (d) multimethod evaluations of pedagogical content knowledge and beliefs, and (e) concept mapping. In the final section, ambiguities and paradoxes inherent in this literature are discussed, particularly the continued use of rhetoric associated with process--product research. Questions regarding the ecological validity of measurement tools and tasks are raised. A suggestion is made that it may be politically exigent to begin relating measures of teacher cognition to valued student outcomes.<br>

Abstract: The introduction of entrepreneurial education (EE) in the Israeli education system is discussed in this article as an example of the introduction of new curriculum. We argue that this introduction should be construed as a consequence of major ideological changes in Israel and its education system, a change from collectivist to individualistic values. We open with an analysis of a Ministry of Education publication that introduces the EE program and find that it is loaded with references to Zionist myths. We suggest that relying on references to these myths in promoting EE reflects a need to disguise the discontinuity between the social values behind the new curriculum and the traditional collectivist values of pioneering Zionism. We note that the Israeli programs exercise EE in groups, whereby the responsibility for the new ventures is shared by the group members. We suggest that adopting the group method indicates a compromise between a completely individualistic and competitive approach to entrepreneurship and a collectivist approach to coping with new tasks-which is more in line with traditional Zionist values. We argue that the change of atmosphere from collectivism to individualism is a result of demographic and economic processes that have occurred since the establishment of the Israeli state, and that these processes may be exposed through observing the Israeli youth movements and the public discourse. We believe that the gradual shift from collectivism to individualism is a central factor in explaining the timing of EE's introduction in Israel.<br>

Abstract: An assumed link between language and experience prompted the narrative collection and mutual interpretation of data between me and an immigrant from Iran whom I taught ESL. An underlying theme of the study was the quest for a helpful image of language. Realizing that dictionary meanings were inadequate in the meaning-making process, we concentrated on illustrative examples for the meaning of words. We exploited mininarratives implicit in such examples-incipient stories based on the speaker's past, present, and imaginatively projected experiences. As we expanded these "experiential narratives," the student's personal practical knowledge emerged and helped clarify troublesome words and sentences. Viewing language as experiential narrative demonstrated the importance of the context of acquisition. It increased opportunities for the negotiation of meaning and highlighted the notion of agency in the constitution of meanings.<br>

Abstract: Buell's view in The Environmental Imagination can serve to epitomize the prevailing
consensus: "Thoreau is often thought of as Emerson's earthy opposite. But it would be
truer to imagine him as moving gradually, partially, and self-conflictedly beyond the pro-
gram Emerson outlined in Nature, which sacralized nature as humankind's mystic coun-
terpart .... Thoreau became increasingly interested in defining nature's structure, both
spiritual and material, for its own sake, as against how nature might subserve humanity,
which was Emerson's primary consideration" (117)<br>

Abstract: Longterm trends are examined for the population mass that occupied the central highlands of Palestine during the Iron Age. After 1200 B. C. the landscape of this sparsely populated "frontier" changed as newcomers established hilltop villages, cultivated intermontane valleys, and terraced the slopes. Spatial patterning within villages and certain toponyms were influenced by patrilineal kinship. Heads of household and their lineage mates exercised rights over inheritance and succession in landholding. Inequalities developed within "tribal" Israel long before the monarchy, probably through a process of "lineage capture;" and clientship, with its dyadic relationships between superiors and inferiors, became more common. Tensions developed within Israelite society from the interactions of kinship, clientship, and kingship. As the population grew under the monarchy, the highland frontier was effectively closed, and opportunities for acquiring new land diminished. Thus, many unmarried males had to look elsewhere for patrons and positions. From the ranks of these noble "youths" came recruits for the military, the government, and the priesthood.<br>

Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Abstract: This essay investigates the roots of a growing impass in contemporary architecture vis a vis the economic, technological, social and political developments of our advanced or late-capitalist society. It focuses upon architecture's apparently diminishing capacity to address our present human condition, yet argues that the problems responsible for the "crisis" of architectural thought and design in general have evolved as the result of historic processes, and therefore the impass can only partially be explained with the short-comings of modern architecture or the 'short sighted' attitude of the architects themselves. Nevertheless, it also argues that architecture, in spite of its now rather limited transformative capacity, should persistently attempt to reveal, rather than mask or otherwise escape, its fundamental relatedness to material processes; that is, to the modes of production and consumption on which social and political power relations are predicated. To be able to do so, and thus to foster a more liberating "form" of human environment, the profession needs first of all a strong political self consciousness, while aiming at a practice of critical inquiry.<br>

Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Abstract: The following essay considers Josep Lluis Sert's American Embassy in Baghdad (1955-1961) as an attempt to project a new basis for American political influence abroad that was compatible with a rapidly changing postcolonial world. Although the United States began its program of embassy construction to accord with its new role as a world power, the government required architects to be sensitive to local conditions of the site and the host country. In Iraq, this meant distinguishing America from both a rival Soviet Union and from England, America's ally but increasingly despised by Iraqis for its uninvited sway over their government, as well as addressing questions of climate and local construction capacities. To negotiate political complexities of the cold war and to balance American ambitions with local conditions, Sert drew on a modernism that was itself in the process of transition due in part to its application to a broader range of building types and social tasks, of which the embassy program is an instance, and in part to the representational pressures such institutional patronage entails.<br>

Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manyness are thoroughly corelative, joined in a dialectical relation of reciprocal implication. This pluralized unity and unified plurality is the ontological matrix of truth's relativity. Symbolic awareness is the interface of contextual meaning and relational being. The density of constitutive relations and the nascence of concrete actuality engender a dissonance between manifest and latent content in the reflection of being in consciousness. The polysemy of symbols captures the polymorphism of being in a way that establishes the need for a constant process of decipherment in which we reformulate our notions in order more fully to penetrate synchronic and diachronic relations that are ontologically definitive. By maintaining the tension between the revealed and the concealed, symbolic awareness insures that knowledge always evolves through ceaseless reinterpretation. For symbolic consciousness, truth, as being itself, forever becomes. The essay concludes with the suggestion that the wedding of a relativistic epistemology and a relational ontology in a symbolics of the religious imagination reopens the possibility of constructive theological reflection in a pluralistic age.<br>

Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theological models of liberation the paper argues that these models be evaluated a) by the criterion of appropriateness to the charter documents and to the historical development of one's chosen religious tradition, b) by the criterion of adequacy to the human condition in its essential commonality and in its historical diversity, and c) by the criterion of dialectical inclusiveness. The paper concludes by agreeing with theologians of liberation that ultimately no set of criteria validates a theology of liberation. As fundamentally geared to praxis, such a theology must be subject to a process of existential verification.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first meaning. This event, really never-ending, is a basic condition of life; it stimulates the spirit in a posture of perpetual emergence.<br>

Abstract: The article describes and analyses the recruitment and training of young Zambians in the 1990s for Catholic religious Brotherhood. The consequences of the missionary employment of Euro-American concepts of personhood and self that involve particular understandings of narrative and the use of psychological testing are explored. The author argues that Zambian understandings of personhood and of individual experience of evil and suffering are silenced in the process of religious formation. This discussion raises salient issues about training for Catholic religious or priestly life in Africa because similar techniques have been commonly employed throughout the continent.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the relation of authority to legitimacy through the social construction of local histories that validate claims to 'authentic' rulership. Using the historical example of the Chiefdom of Uyombe in northern Zambia, I intend to argue that the construction of these local histories has been a crucial element in the process of domination, subjugation, resistance and collaboration between rulers and those they would rule. Exploring specific Gramscian concepts, I will also argue that historical narratives contain hegemonic and ideological components that are critical to relating authority to legitimacy in an active manner. These narratives contain African voices, which express varied local interests. Through the narratives, Africans may be seen as active agents in contributing to the making of their own local histories of rulership. Thus, authority and legitimacy are conjoined through the fabrication, inscription and recitation of historical narratives and are an essential part of governance.<br>

Abstract: Perhaps the greatest challenge to an existential phenomenological account of perception is that posed by the argument from illusions. Recent developments in research on the behaviour of subjects suffering from illusions together with some seminal ideas found in Merleau-Ponty's writings enable us to develop and corroborate an account of the phenomenon of illusions, one, which unlike the empiricist account, does not undermine our conviction that in perception we "reach the things themselves". The traditional argument from illusions derives its force from an uncritical assumption that the process of experience takes place in time conceived as an infinite series of distinct moments. Once this assumption has been bracketed we are able to recognise the paradoxical truth that in the disillusion something can become that which it has always been and can cease to be that which it has never been. Furthermore, through a reflection on our experience of others overcoming their illusions, and on psychological evidence, we are able to show that there is nothing to suggest that this description of the disillusion is a description of a private or subjective event.<br>

Abstract: Rwanda became a Belgian trusteeship under mandate of the Société des Nations after the first World War. With churches playing a prominent role in the political evolution of Rwanda, the two countries were closely bound together. After the 1959 revolution in Rwanda and independence in 1962, development cooperation with strong NGO input still linked them. While the genocide still has tragic influence on the new Rwanda, Belgium has undergone a political process leading to a federal state. The colonial past refers to a national past. Changes in Rwanda and Belgium question any collective attempt of mourning for a past that is very different for all parties involved. /// Le Rwanda devint une possession de la Belgique sous le mandat de la Société des Nations après la Première Guerre Mondiale. La conséquence du rôle proéminent des églises dans l'évolution politique du Rwanda fut la création de liens étroits entre les deux pays. Après la révolution de 1959 au Rwanda et l'indépendance en 1962, la coopération de développement avec l'impact des ONG ont maintenu ces liens entre les deux pays. Alors que le génocide a aujourd'hui toujours des conséquences sur le Rwanda moderne, la Belgique a, elle, a vécu une transformation politique menant à la formation d'un état fédéral. Le passé colonial se mire dans le passé national. Les transformations du Rwanda et de la Belgique mettent en question toute tentative collective de faire l'expérience du deuil d'un passé commun, vécu de manière très différente par les deux cultures.<br>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the revival and reconstruction of polyphonic settings of the Latin Mass in selected villages in Corsica. Many such mass settings, often unique to a single village and preserved only in oral tradition, fell into disuse during the first half of the 20th century for a variety of reasons that are briefly explored. In some cases, however, fragments remained in the memories of surviving singers or on old recordings and these were to provide the seeds for the repertoire's later renaissance. My account of the processes of retrieval, reconstruction and re-absorption of the musical material itself is balanced by an examination of the different motives and ideologies of the various parties involved, together with an exploration of the broader theoretical implications of the enterprise of reclaiming the musical patrimony and, in particular, what it reveals about attitudes towards the past, authenticity, ownership and local identity. In the course of my analysis I draw on a series of metaphors and paradigms from the fields of archaeology and heritage conservation. Ultimately, I argue that the renewed practice of singing the mass in the "old way" should be viewed as an authentic part of the Corsican present.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Abstract: This article offers an alternative to classical hermeneutics, which focuses on discursive products and grasps meaning as the play of difference between linguistic signs. Pragmatist hermeneutics reconstructs meaning through an indefinite triangulation, which brings symbols, icons, and indices to bear on each other and considers a meaningful occasion as an embodied semiotic process. To illuminate the word-body-action nexus, the discussion identifies three basic types of signifying media: (1) the symbolic-discursive, (2) the somatic-affective, and (3) the behavioral-performative, each one marked by a special relationship between signs and their objects. An argument is made that the tension between various type-signifying media is unavoidable, that the pragmatic-discursive misalignment is an ontological condition, and that bridging the gap between our discursive, affective, and behavioral outputs is at the heart of ethical life.<br>

Abstract: Formative assessment has attracted increasing attention from both practitioners and scholars over the last decade. This paper draws on the authors' empirical research conducted over eleven years in educational situations ranging from infant schools to postgraduate education to propose a theorisation of formative assessment. Formative assessment is seen as taking place when teachers and learners seek to respond to student work, making judgements about what is good learning with a view to improving that learning. However, the theorisation emphasises formative assessment as being a discursive social practice, involving dialectical, sometimes conflictual, processes. These bring into play issues of power in which learners' and teachers' identities are implicated and what counts as legitimate knowledge is framed by institutional discourses and summative assessment demands. The paper argues that, rather than only paying attention to the content of learning, an ambition for formative assessment might be to deconstruct these contextual issues, allowing a critical consideration of learning as a wider process of becoming. The article suggests a model that might be useful to teachers and learners in achieving this.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri di altre discipline. A questo proposito si pone per Kelley il
problema dell'atteggiamento da tenere nei confronti di studiosi come Hayden White,
Dominick LaCapra, David Harlan, teorici del linguistic turn, un modo di fare storia che
si awale delle indicazioni provenienti dall'ermeneutica di Gadamer e Ricoeur, da Hei-
degger e dai suoi discepoli francesi Foucault e Derrida, e che rifiuta ogni reale possibi-
lità di giungere a una determinazione delle intenzioni dell'autore, cioè di un «significa-
to», della verità di un'opera, e del contesto entro cui Topera è stata composta. Per Kel-
ley non era possibile evitare le implicazioni che il linguistic turn poneva, tanto piú che
esso si rivelava utile soprattutto nel rivelare risorse, strutture, memorie culturali conser-
vate nel linguaggio (topoi, tropi, metafore, analogie), non soltanto dell'alta cultura ma

zione di Lovejoy). Se è però vero che il significato di un testo non è univoco, è altret-
tanto vero secondo Kelley che la ricerca delle intenzioni dell'autore è premessa indi-
spensabile di qualsiasi lavoro di storia intellettuale. Quanto alia questione dell'attenzio-
ne al «contesto», che i sostenitori del linguistic turn denigrano, Kelley prende atto che
non è certamente possibile giungere alia ricostruzione dell'intera rete di relazioni entro
cui un'opera si colloca. Ciò non significa pero che il testo o l'autore studiato non pos-
sano essere collocati in un «contesto», e che quindi, attraverso lo studio del linguaggio
di un'epoca, non si riesca a ricostruire le condizioni di possibilità per la nascita di
un'opera.<br>

Abstract: Using the example of former Yugoslavia, specifically the Serbian and Croatian nations, this article examines the transformation of collective memory of aggression and victimhood by focusing on the content of national narratives. The article begins by examining narratives developed at the founding of Yugoslavia and proceeds to trace the reinterpretation of these narratives as a function of their political instrumentality—especially in Serbia and Croatia—for respective nationalist projects. In the end, the article provides tools with which to frame two questions: first, whether political and social stability is being created at the cost of forgetting and repression; second, whether a "policy of remembrance" is socially "desirable" in practice. Both forgetting and an instrumental "policy of remembrance" based on the power of revelation perpetuate aggressor—victim divisions: what is needed, rather, is a stable, systematic process of remembrance and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Chile's collective memory has been brutalized by state-implemented terrorism. This historical process has resulted in, among other things, a "torn collective memory." The history and memory of the period of so-called popular power (1970-1973) continue to be largely unknown. Oral history allows us to begin a slow process of historical reconstruction as well as to reflect on the construction of militant memories.<br>

Abstract: The dictatorship in Chile perpetrated massive human rights violations for 17 years, causing a rupture in social processes and engendering fear in the population. Data being gathered in an ongoing participatory action research study of the población (shanty-town) La Pincoya show that while memory can be debilitating to most persons, it may empower others. Memories of the practices of the military regime continue to cause fear in some of the population, affecting community cohesion and participation in local organizations. This has led to the dismantling of social networks in the community, robbing members of their ability to be the protagonists of their own lives.<br>

Abstract: This paper focuses on gendered processes of socialization experienced by Christian religious groups in different Christian churches in post-civil war Gorongosa, a district in the centre of Mozambique. Discourses of radical social transformation through Christian interventions and experiences are prominent among Christians, both men and women. Yet a comprehensive and longitudinal analysis of the social world in which the Christian groups are embedded and the performances of Christian men and women demonstrates the emergence of complex processes of transformation and continuities with local cultural beliefs and practices that many non-Christians have partially or thoroughly reformed or abandoned. These changes and continuities also encompass the manifestation of fluid forms of submission and creativity, and masculinities and femininities against the ideological notion of thoroughly new and closed Christian identities. The overall analysis suggests that the tension between the practices of change and continuity are necessary in order to create and sustain the legitimacy of the various Christian groups in Gorongosa.<br>

Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: Some literary theorists have suggested that the process of reading is a complex one and is central to the interpretation of texts. These theorists do not ignore the creation of texts or the authors' creative activities, but place special emphasis on the role of the reader. This approach has relevance for the study of the use of libraries. This paper offers an analogy between text and library and between reader and library user. The analogy is possible because both reader and user adopt intentional stances with regard to that which is to be interpreted and employ cognitive and affective means in interpretation. At the heart of this approach is a phenomenological-hermeneutical way of thinking that treats reading and library use as an event consisting of varying intention and interpretive possibilities.<br>

Abstract: Experiences that do not fit squarely into known categories pose a challenge to notions of organizational learning that rely primarily on scientific or experiential approaches. Making sense of, responding to, and learning from such unusual experiences requires reflection and novel action by organizational actors. We argue that narrative development processes make this organizational learning possible. By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning.<br>

Abstract: This close reading of one poem by Dickinson, « Crisis is sweet », wishes to demonstrate that the poet makes us share in a multiple experience of crisis combining sexual climax, mystical revelation, and the destruction of the poetic image. Positing a multi-level definition of crisis, the poem shows that the very process of definition — undoubtedly one of Dickinson's preferred modes of tackling with reality — entails a fundamental crisis and criticism of representation.<br>

Certains aspects-clés du concept de canon dans le contexte culturel américain sont d'abord examinés, puis différents aspects du processus de canonisation de la littérature chinoise américaine sont étudiés à travers trois récits récents, autour de l'idée centrale développée par Charles Altieri du canon comme « idéalisation ».<br>

Abstract: Interpretation is central to the social scientist's process of analysis, regardless of whether that analysis relies on quantitative or qualitative data. This essay presents a "reconstructed logic" of the interpretation process involved in quantitative data analysis. Drawing upon a broad literature on interpretation, the paper shows how the interpretive processes for quantitative "data" has significant similarities to interpretation in other settings. For example, both qualitative textual analysis and quantitative statistical analysis rely upon contextual and topological paradigms, although the specific conventions differ in many respects. The process of play employed by musicians and actors in developing an interpretation of a piece of music or a dramatic role suggests ways in which the quantitative analyst might let data perform to help in arriving at appropriate interpretations of statistical results. The lines between quantitative and qualitative social science are less clear than often presumed. Both types of analysis involve extensive interpretation, and tools of interpretation that have many fundamental similarities.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Abstract: Schwartz argues for the later rabbinic development of practices related to death: "Indeed, if it
is the case that even strongly 'Jewish' Jews were often buried without the accompaniment of Jewish
iconography—that despite what we are accustomed to think about such liminal moments as birth,
death, marriage and so on, death was not yet generally an occasion among Palestinian Jews for
strong public affirmation of group identity—then Beth Shearim shows that the judaization of
Jewish burial practice was now (third-fourth century) underway in some circles" (2001: 154).<br>

Abstract: Dans un contexte marqué par la crise et l'incertitude des repères individuels et collectifs, les besoins de reconnaissance sont de plus en plus intenses et pressants chez les salariés. Toutefois, en dépit du foisonnement de la littérature managériale sur les bienfaits de la reconnaissance au travail, il existe un manque de conceptualisation systématique et d'analyse approfondie de la reconnaissance, de ses formes et de ses critères. L'objectif de cette étude est de clarifier et de mieux asseoir le concept de la reconnaissance et ses manifestations au travail. En mettant en perspective les liens entre reconnaissance et construction identitaire, il s'agit de proposer une lecture du rôle de la reconnaissance dans le processus de construction de l'identité professionnelle.<br>

Abstract: This essay focuses on a strange medieval phenomenon, the so-called gift of tears—religious weeping that brings beatitude. This internal purifying process, which was embedded in the specific conditions of historical Christianity, was described and understood as a procedure in which God himself acts and, therefore, as a process that humankind cannot learn, formalize, or ritualize. However, the author analyzes religious weeping as a peculiar, 'intimate ritual' in which the formalized process took place in the soul or spirituality of the weeping person. This essay aims to describe and analyze this practice while examining the historical conditions that enabled such a cultural elaboration to develop.<br>

Abstract: This article explores socio-cultural practices with regard to aging women in Vārāṇāsī, a city in North India. It is based on 17 months of field research carried out in 1999—2000 among marginalized Hindu women. I argue that aging is a continuous process that is characterized by the specific psychological patterns that form throughout a woman's life history. These patterns are demonstrated by women's particular types of behaviors and demeanors and, in turn, permit others to ascribe to them—in varying combinations and ratios—specific cultural values or qualities. I argue that these attributes are the critical ones that inform the cultural construction and designation of being 'middle-aged' and 'older' as it pertains to Hindu women of Vārāṇāsī.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: The ultramodern condition represents the "third wave" in postmodernist-inspired philosophy and cultural practice. Two of ultramodernism's critical theoretical components are the human/social forces, flows, and assemblages that sustain transgression; and the human/social intensities, fluctuations, and thresholds that make transcendence possible as both will and way. In the ultramodern age, then, transcendence is about overcoming and transforming the conditions (i.e., forces, flows, and assemblages) that co-produce harm-generating (i.e., transgressive) tendencies. This manuscript problematizes transgression by way of ultramodern theory. This critical investigation represents "the phenomenology of the shadow," or the ultramodern philosophy of harm. To contextualize this phenomenology and philosophy, the intellectual history of ultramodern thought is recounted. This includes a review of the shadow construct by way of its prominent socio-cultural, psychoanalytic, and political-economic currents; and a chronicling of the reification process (regarding risk, captivity, and harm) since the modernist era (i.e., the industrial revolution). The article concludes with some very speculative observations concerning "the phenomenology of the stranger," or the ultramodern philosophy of transcendence as both will and way.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining resources for re-establishing communication when the hermeneutic circle breaks down in a moment of misunderstanding.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mankind: The discovery of the unreality of man's existence apart from God, is the discovery at the same time of the fact that God is the ultimate ground of the unity of mankind. According to Jaspers the fact of life are to conform to the principle of that wider order of reality disclosed to us in the experience of communication in which the reality of each person's likeness to the image of God finds its practical application. The development of communication depends on the principle of correlation of Existenz and Transcendenz which is the property of no finite existential self, but manifests itself alike in all. Though we may be confronted with the question "Is it God or the devil who governs the world?", it remains equally true that even "failure is no argument against the truth that is rooted in transcendence". 3) Ultimate Dignity of Man: Jaspers' unequivocal emphasis on freedom, stating that "Freedom and God are inseparable" serves to assure this ideal its place in human society. Thus man's exercise of freedom knits him up into the transcendental design. The claim that certain facts and experiences yield a basis for the recognition of the ultimate dignity of man is justified precisely by this evidence that through God, as inseparable from freedom, we discern the ultimate significance of both man and humanity.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to define the nature of the metaphor in Berdiczewski's novel Miriam (1921). For this purpopse I examine the short story included in Miriam about the scholar who was studying a book entitled The Gate of Heaven. Comparing this story with other literary texts which present a hero who stands in a mystical or philosophical sense before the gate of Heaven illuminates the historic-generative essence of the above metaphor. Using the theoretical and methodological system developed by three scholars (P. Ricuer, D. Schon and B. Indurkyia) to follow the metaphorical process, I attempt to show that Berdiczewski's metaphors are not only figures of speech; they form our essential cultural and historical cognition (tolada in Hebrew). I therefore suggest applying to Berdiczewski's metaphor the form 'historic-generative metaphor.'<br>

Abstract: The paper examines the process of figurative reading in the presence of a marker (like / as), namely the unique cognitive impact caused by shaping figurative expressions as similes. The solution is sought through theoretical discussion and analysis of relevant excerpts from Hebrew poetry. Recently Bethlehem argued that a simile does not necessarily indicate the presence of resemblance of some sort; the simile only presents itself as such via its marker, like/as, but actually it can bear a variety of figurative relations, of which metaphoric relations are only one possible option. Consequently, simile has only coincidental relations with metaphor, if any (Bethlehem, 1996: 1997) First I address this criticism, trying to reinforce the widespread view that a simile is indeed a sub-type of metaphor, and that there is no fundamental difference between them, that is, comprehension processes in metaphor and simile are basically similar. Next I distinguish the simile from the literal comparison in a new comprehensive way. Finally I try to identify and study the special impression a figurative expression might create as a result of being shaped as a simile. Despite this basic sameness of simile and metaphor, the marker's presence in a simile has its unique cognitive effects, accumulating to a distinctive impact. I analyze the unique cognitive effects potentially evolved during the construction process of the simile's meaning. In this analysis this paper reexamines central issues pertaining to similes, their essence, and the cognitive processes they trigger in readers. Among these I focus on a problem never thoroughly explored so far: the essential nature of the coexistence of similarity and dissimilarity (without working against each other) in both metaphor and simile.<br>

Abstract: It has been argued that in higher education academic disciplines can be seen as communities of practices. This implies a focus on what constitutes identities in academic culture. In this article I argue that the transition from newcomer to a full participant in a community of practice of physicists entails a focus on how identities emerge in learning how to highlight certain aspects of personal life histories. The analysis of interviews with 55 physicists shows that physicists often perceive experiences in their childhood as the first step into their professional identities as physicists. These experiences involve recollections of the ability to think scientifically (e.g., 'go beyond the surface'), and the ability to play with toys which can be connected to the practical life of physics. The process of identity formation can be described as developing in a relational zone of proximal development, where old-timers recognize particular playful qualities in newcomers as a legitimate access to a physicist identity. The article discusses how play which physicists connects with a scientific mind can constitute a relational zone of proximal developments in a community of practice as a particular "space of authoring" in a physicist culture, which cut across other cultural differences. Il a été admis que les disciplines de l'éducation supérieure peuvent être considérées comme des communautés de pratique. Cela pose la question de savoir comment se constituent les identités dans la culture académique. Dans cet article, pour mettre en évidence la transition de nouveau venu à participant à part entière dans une communauté de pratique de physiciens, j'examine non seulement la manière dont des identités émergent au travers des pratiques, mais aussi les aspects biographiques que les participants identifient comme ayant facilité leur transition. Une cohorte de 55 physiciens a été interviewée et leurs analyses ont été comparées à des données supplémentaires, notamment tirées d'une observation participante d'étudiants en physique. Les physiciens identifient souvent des expériences de leur enfance comme premiers pas vers leur identité professionnelle de physiciens. Ces expériences requièrent une pensée de type scientifique et une capacité à jouer liée avec les pratiques de la physique. Le processus de formation identitaire peut être décrit comme se développant dans une zone relationnelle de développement proximal, dans laquelle les aînés reconnaissent les qualités ludiques des nouveaux venus comme légitimant leur accès à l'identité de physicien. L'article discute la manière dont le jeu, que les physiciens associent à l'esprit scientifique, constitue une zone de développement proximal dans une communauté de pratique, comme «espace d'auteur» dans la culture des physiciens — laquelle peut par ailleurs dépasser d'autres différences culturelles.<br>

Abstract: Archaeological examinations of symbolic meaning often have been hampered by the Saussurean concept of signs as coded messages of preexisting meanings. The arbitrary and imprecise manner by which meaning is represented in material culture according to Saussure tends to stymie archaeological investigations of symbolism. As an alternative, archaeologists recently have drawn on Peirce's semiotic to investigate how materiality is bound to the creation of meanings through the process of signification. This study examines how the symbolism expressed in pottery of the Middle Woodland period south-eastern United States, Swift Creek Complicated Stamped and Weeden Island effigy vessels, might be better explained as icons and indexes that were enlisted to have particular social effects. Examining the semiotic potentials of these objects helps explain their apparent uses and the significance of alternative representations of the same subjects. En repetidas ocasiones los estudios arqueológicos sobre el significado de símbolos han sido obstaculizados por el concepto Saussureano que define los signos como mensajes codificados con un significado preexistente. De acuerdo con Saussure, la manera arbitraria e imprecisa por la cual cierto significado se encuentra representado en la cultura material tiende a bloquear las investigaciones arqueológicas que estudian objetos simbólicos. Como alternativa los arqueólogos han comenzado a basarse en la semiótica de Peirce, con el fin de investigar de qué manera la materialidad está ligada a la creación de significados a través del proceso de creación de signos o significación. En este estudio se examinaron piezas de alfarería del sur oriente de los Estados Unidos, provenientes del periodo medio Woodland, de los complejos estampados Swift Creek y esfinges representadas en vasijas Weeden Island. El objetivo es demostrar que los símbolos expresados en dichas piezas podrían ser interpretados como iconos e índices que fueron establecidos para efectos sociales particulares. Por medio de la investigación del potencial semiótico de estos especímenes es posible explicar sus presuntos usos, así como la significación de representaciones alternativas de los mismos objetos.<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes how Newman's Apologia seeks to articulate nineteenth-century conceptions of time through a canonical conception of prophetism, and how the question of private space is made into a national issue through Newman's narrative. The paper finally argues that Newman's technique of "replacement" deconstructs itself as a metaphorical process, which makes for the unique literariness of the Apologia.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of interpreting the concepts of tradition and traditionalism with specific reference to the tradition of the Anatolian house and the recent erosion of place quality in Turkish towns. The Anatolian house provides a remarkable example of cultural diffusion and transformation. During the reign of the late Ottoman, a variety of cultures impinged on one another, giving rise to autochthonous traditions that were shared by different religious and ethnic groups. But during the Republican Period the process of Westernization interrupted the continuity of historic traditions, resulting in the emergence of a peculiar contemporary tradition. The majority of Turkish housing today displays characteristics of a "vernacular modernism" conditioned by the moral and technical orders of a market economy. The worldwide spread of such cultural mediocrity has often been attributed to the corrosive influence of a single world civilization. A number of recent attempts have been made to search for a national idiom in Turkey. But these attempts, often promoting a "vernacular historicism," have yet to account for any distinct revision of urban house-form. Argument today revolves around an old rhetorical opposition between universal civilization and national culture. Should a post-traditional society sustain its cultural tradition to attain universal values, or vice-versa? The conservative in this debate is more involved in the revival than in the preservation of tradition. The progressive, though an ardent defender of preservation, resists revivalism because of its chauvinistic connotations and pastiche effects. This paper attempts to resolve this argument by suggesting a simultaneous unfolding of the historical problems of the Anatolian house tradition and the theoretical problems of presumed dichotomies such as "traditional vs. modern." Finally, the paper advocates the development of research strategies to facilitate correct readings of cultural tradition and design strategies to improve the quality of residential environments.<br>

Abstract: We can distinguish two different kinds in the educational process, the one called «learning education» and the one leading to a possible «autonomous education» in which every-body's freedom is above everything else. The former is education for technoscientists. The later, the «autonomous education» is supported by the thesis that knowing oneself as «moriturus», forces one to provide a sense or meaning, technologies and educational sciencies not being enough. Death forces us to decide the possible, only opposed by the impossible.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the role of teacher, in the process of curriculum development, is conceptually dependent on the different curriculum approaches. It has been analysed and discussed the instrumental role (user and implementor) which it has from a technical-scientific approach, the curriculum development agent's role from an interpretative-cultural view, and the role of the institucional development from a critical approach. The potentialities and insufficiencies of a curriculum practical view and the teacher's role have been analysed. We suggest the School Institutional Development as one of the most promising ways for curriculum development.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le débat sur le fait que l'enseignement de la technologie a besoin d'aborder des aspects critiques et de valeur reconnue avec un accent mis sur la construction durable des relations chez les êtres humains, dans la technologie et dans la vie mondiale. Dans le but de comprendre les relations entre l'action humaine et la technologie moderne, nous analysons la nature de la technologie en tant que causalité et en tant que relation de la vie mondiale. Nous discutons des perspectives de Martin Heidegger sur les causalités de la technologie. Nous posons des questions sur la manière que la nature de la technologie situe les êtres humains dans les relations basées sur le pouvoir face au monde. Nous assimilons la technologie comme processus et comme relation de la vie mondiale. L'article élargit les propos sur la responsabilité dune relation dialectale humaine technologie/vie mondiale, fondée sur une structure de technologie sociotechnique et éthico morale. En reconnaissant la responsabilité humaine de et pour la technologie moderne, nous soulignons une démarche critique et réfléchie de l'alphabétisme technologique. La démarche remet en question la position des approches actuelles vers le chemin de la technologie afin d'apporter une base à une pédagogie contemporaine de sensibilisation et de valeurs technologiques.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the production of an Islamic utopian or millennial discourse by British South Asian Muslims in the diasporic public sphere and its possible impact on the younger generation of Muslims growing up in the UK. Associated with such a discourse, the article considers the vulnerability of diasporas — the process whereby global events can precipitate radical diasporic estrangement, leading to self-estrangement. Such estrangement is fed by moral panics, expressed in the speeches of politicians, in newspaper columns and global news reports. This exposes the fragility of multicultural discourses in the public sphere in the UK.<br>

Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the significance of the concept of culture for organizational analysis. The intersection of culture theory and organization theory is evident in five current research themes: comparative management, corporate culture, organizational cognition, organizational symbolism, and unconscious processes and organization. Researchers pursue these themes for different purposes and their work is based on different assumptions about the nature of culture and organization. The task of evaluating the power and limitations of the concept of culture must be conducted within this assumptive context. This review demonstrates that the concept of culture takes organization analysis in several different and promising directions.<br>

Abstract: Mythical configurations of a personal deity and a dominant sexual identity are part of our western history. In particular, the religious myths of patriarchy have privileged a male God and devalued female desire—and, with her desire, sexual difference. There can be no facile way beyond these myths. Instead the proposal here is for feminist theologians to attempt new configurations of old myths and disruptive refigurations, i.e. transformative mimesis, of biased beliefs. Myth and mimesis can enable expression of multiple identities. Only identities-in-process preserve the possibility for a peaceful revolution of our desires and our differences, religious and sexual.<br>

Abstract: Bible reading occurs at intersection of perpetually shifting canons—of textual meaning, interpretative strategies, and preferred textual menu for particular contemporary consumption. Such continual up-to-datedness is the Bible's, as it is the classic's, only survival kit. Contemporary reading is the only reading—ever. Post-modernism's biblical reading menu is notable for its post-modernist yields of meaning; but textual post-modernism—aporias, textual unboundedness, canonical on-edgedness, apocryphalism, etcetera—is typical of biblical texts' ur-post-modernism (the Bible living up, of course, to applied post-modernist reading expectations). All such reading is an aestheticisation, a fictionalising process—abusive naturally; constructively abusive, perhaps; but always catachretical, demythologising, a negative theology. But, of course, this is utterly inevitable for now.<br>

Abstract: I propose both a critique of canonicity and a feminist defence of the careful re-reading of certain canonical texts. My proposal for a critique of the limits of our thinking about and with texts is informed by a re-reading of the canonical text of Kant. Admittedly Kant himself might be excluded from any possible feminist canon whether in literary theory or theology. However, my qualified defence of the Kantian text is part of a larger concern to rethink texts by men and women. The aim is not to reaffirm a conservative culture, but to provide crucial tools for the judgements and practices of still highly significant forms of critical hermeneutics. In particular, the process of suppression and repression of valuable texts by women and minorities cannot properly be reversed without taking seriously the particular skills of post-Kantian critique. Critical and historical skills will help distinguish when to think merely about a text and when to think with it so that we might come up with a new picture of canon.<br>

Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object here. It contributes to the matter of the article and its interpretation is interwoven with the theoretical substance. The story is shown to be an integrated narrative abounding in sophisticated linguistic techniques which show a delight in language. The traditional Christian and Western interpretation of Babel – as an affront to God which results in the curse of multilingualism – is challenged. A re-constructed interpretation informed by intertextual evidence reads the fault of Babel to be the people's refusal to spread through the earth. Babel can be interpreted as a manifesto against the monolingual and monocultural impetus of empires ancient and contemporary. The multilingual outcome is a positive affirmation of sociocultural and linguistic diversity.<br>

Abstract: Text interpretation – the main interest of discourse analysts – is a central component of the text understanding process. In this article we introduce the Landscape Model, which describes the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension in a detailed and precise manner. Moreover, this model captures the interpretative processes in which the human mind engages during reading. Within the context of the Landscape Model, we describe the relation between discourse understanding and discourse interpretation, and explain some of the phenomena that are central to the field of discourse analysis as seen from a cognitive perspective. In the first section we describe the basic cognitive processes that underlie discourse understanding, as captured by the Landscape Model. In the following section we illustrate the way that the Landscape Model can be applied to the work of discourse analysts. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the cognitive Landscape Model for the field of discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Original Sin is considered to be a uniquely Christian doctrine. Nevertheless, an analysis of apparently forgotten Jewish treatises — most of which are to be found only in manuscript form — reveals that an extraordinary philosophical theory of Original Sin is present in late medieval Jewish thought. It implies, therefore, a new dimension in characterising this doctrine and has implications for the understanding of the process of inter-communicating of Jewish and Christian thought. This study focuses on fundamental Jewish passages, beginning with Apocalyptic literature and ending with medieval philosophical texts. Yet, the examination of those Hebrew texts is carried out in the light of the writing of Christian scholars. This means that the attempt to clarify this Jewish doctrine is made, from a methodological viewpoint, both by looking at the development of this doctrine trough the history of the Jewish thought, and by a close examination of the parallel general sources. It is only then that one can see that rudiments of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin were inserted into the Aristotelian theory of Nature, and combined with elements from Maimonides' Biblical-allegoric exegesis.<br>

créativité humaine plus qu'à un processus d'objectivation. Il s'appuie explicitement (bien que
Merleau-Ponty ne soit pas directement évoqué) sur le point de vue de la phénoménologie et sur
les outils qu'elle nous fournit pour penser la perpétuation du monde commun comme culture
vivante, ensemble de valeurs partagées dans la durée autant que dans l'espace.<br>

Abstract: An initial awareness is needed of the debates regarding the choice of research approaches in sociology and the diversity and specificity of methods currently being used in the domain of textual data analysis in France. In general the influence of the French socio-linguistic tradition looms large, including, on the one hand, the older works of Michel Pécheux on the "discursive formations" and his A.A.D. (Analyse Automatique du Discours, 1969), and on the other hand, two main perspectives of the "Ecole Française d'Analyse du/de Discours" - which refer to the "speech act" concept and to the problematics of enunciation, and emphasizes the processes and "sociodiscursive practices" between socially-located speakers. Such theoretical conceptions and specific requirements lead to build on methodologies different from the classic, theme-based content analysis, though not yet translated into an operational software. Then the main software developments currently having an impact (at least potential) on practices of computer-aided sociological analysis of textual data, in France, are classified : from the lexicometric using procedures of "French Data Analysis" ('Analyse Factorielle des Correspondances' of Benzecri, and so on...), to a set of "expert-systems" working on specific theoretical frameworks, through more classical methods of content analysis and coding-sorting-retrieving socio-semantic procedures, eventually with various statistical methods. L'auteur expose d'abord quelques considèrations épistémologiques générales sur les présupposés implicites des méthodes de recherche sociologique, abusivement séparées en qualitatives et quantitatives, et des interrogations spécifiques sur le statut des corpus textuels et des pratiques socio-discursives dans différents domaines et selon divers types de problématique en sociologie. Puis, après un résumé des problématiques sociolinguistiques de l'"énonciation", propres aux courants de l'Analyse de Discours à la française", il propose une classification des principaux lieux d'élaboration théorico-méthodologique ayant (ou susceptibles d'avoir) un impact sur les pratiques informatisées d'analyse textuelle: de la lexicométrique inspirée de l'"Analyse des données a la française", actuellement dominante, a des quasi-systèmes-experts, branchés sur des problématiques sociologiques particulières, en passant par des méthodes plus "classiques" d'analyse de contenu thématique, de type socio-sémantique, et de codification a posteriori de réponses à des questions ouvertes et autres énoncés produits en langage naturel.<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the narrative representation of the desert in Leslie Silko's Ceremony and Ibrahim Al-Koni's The Bleeding of the Stone. In both novels, the physical is transformed into an existential realm, through which questions about human existence are raised. The desert is a microcosm that allows for a re-enactment of the story of creation. It is also the catalyst in the protagonists' initiation processes and the loci for the ceremonies necessary for restoring balance in the universe. But whereas Silko's novel celebrates desert myths as the infallible source of wisdom, Al-Koni's text regards the desert as a stimulus for Sufi quest. يلفتنا في كثير من روايات إبراهيم الكوني النظر إلى الصحراء بوصفها وسيله إلى فهم الحياه نفسها، حيث تبدو مركز العالم، وما سواها هو الهامش وأهله الأغيار، كما أن حقيقة الإنسان هي حقيقة الصحراء. ونجد أنفسنا في روايات ليزلي مارمون سيلكو بإزاء نصوص تستحضر الأرض بحيث تدمج بين الزمني والفضائي، وتبني الأسطورة الضاربة في عمق الزمن واللاوعي، وذلك في اﻵني والمعيش وفضاء الشخصيات المتفاعلة. تحاول المقالة استكشاف التمثيل السردﻱ للصحراء على مستوى الرؤية والتقنيات في رواية نزيف الحجر للكوني والطقوس لسيلكو، ملقية الضوء على نقاط الالتقاء والاختلاف بين عالميهما، وصولاﹰ إلى تأويل علاقة النص بالصحراء والعالم .<br>

Abstract: While identity researchers are utilizing a variety of methods, the potential advantages of combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods remain largely unexploited. This article discusses the interplay of methods, theoretical content and meta-theoretical assumptions in identity research and calls for the use of mixed methods. The article applies a symbolic interactionist perspective and discusses what aspects of identification different methodological approaches provide insight into. It is discussed how different methodologies imply different assumptions about identity, particularly regarding the stability of identities, the constitution of identities and the conception of meaning. The influential quantitative Burke–Tully approach is brought into focus and compared to different qualitative approaches, particularly narrative interviews. A quantitative self-report measure neglects the narrative, performative and embodied quality of identification. However, the quantitative approach of Burke and Tully enables the systematic, standardized comparison of individuals making it possible to examine patterns of identification in large populations. Since different methods enable the study of different aspects of identity, while remaining blind to other aspects, mixed methods may contribute to more complete insights into identity processes. Importantly, mixed methods may be used to examine patterns available to the outside observer and the lifeworld of the individual actor and thus to both explain and understand.<br>

Abstract: Evoquant l'habitude, Ricœur constate qu'elle donne une histoire au
caractère : « une histoire dans laquelle la sédimentation tend à recouvrir et, à la
limite, à abolir l'innovation qui l'a précédée [...]. C'est cette sédimentation qui
confère au caractère la sorte de permanence dans le temps que j'interprète ici
comme recouvrement de Y ipse par l'idem ». In Soi-même comme un autre,
Paris, Seuil, 1990, p. 146.
L'ipseque Philippe Corcuff synthétise comme « la part subjective de l'identité
personnelle » (« Figures de l'individualité, de Marx aux sociologies
contemporaines », Espacestemps.net, web : http://www.espacestemps.net/
documentl390.html, 2005, non paginé) renvoie à la possibilité de n'être que
partiellement investi dans un rôle. On glisse ici du caractère à l'appartenance
pour amener cette idée d'un retrait ou d'une déprise de l'identité stabilisée
autour de symboles rigides en faveur de moments de mise en avant d'une
identité personnelle répondant à un besoin d'individualisation.<br>

Abstract: Environmentally we seem to be both the victims and the perpetrators of a type of bait and switch: lured into the discussion by one set of intuitions, our interests become redescribed in terms that are intellectually more respectable. Our deepest concerns with the environment are converted into foreign discourses, as we strain to make the languages of science, economics, and interest group politics express our intuitions. The circumscription of environmental philosophy within environmental ethics is one manifestation of this process of bait and switch. 'Corrosive Effects' critiques this process through a case study of acid mine drainage-water pollution resulting from mining activities. An analysis of acid mine drainage reveals the metaphysical and theological roots of many of our environmental problems.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Broad definitions are often used in Christian apologetics. One example: 'Everyone has a
worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: The main aim of this article is to offer a critical reflection on the need of rethinking the teachers' professional skills and their academic pathway, given the changes and current transformations (crisis, in its etymological sense). In fact, a series of changes, transformations, are identified and affect directly the educator's comprehension. Amongst others: the transformation of work bound up with the processes of the economic globalization, and the transformation of the learning environments imbued by the TICs; the population growth, a demographic transformation with geopolitics relevance, and finally, as a result from the previous ones, the raise in the migratory flows. Under this context, this paper tries to reconceptualize teachers' training and their depiction as professionals from the view of Gustav Mahler in his statement Tradition is the spreading of fire and not the veneration of ashes. Thereupon, some categories that help in the teaching update, are proposed and explained; such as authority (as reputation or moral authority, role model and, hence, less so as bare exercise of power), the personalization of education, the importance of home community (society), and, lastly, the alternation within school-society and work-study. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una reflexión acerca de la necesidad de re-pensar la profesionalidad de los docentes y de su itinerario formativo, a la luz los cambios y transformaciones actuales (crisis, en sentido etimológico). En efecto, se identifican una serie de cambios, de transformaciones, que afectan directamente a la comprensión del docente, del enseñante. Entre otros: la transformación del trabajo vinculada a los procesos de la globalización económica y la transformación de los entornos de aprendizaje imbuidos en las TICs; el aumento de la población, la transformación demográfica con trascendencia geopolítica; y por último, y como confluencia de las dos anteriores, el aumento de los flujos migratorios. En este contexto, el trabajo trata de reconceptualizar la formación de los profesores y de su imagen como profesionales desde el enfoque que era expresado por Gustav Mahler en la frase la tradición es el mantenimiento del fuego y no la adoración de sus cenizas. Así, se proponen y se explican algunas categorías que ayudan a la actualización de la docencia hoy, tales como: la autoridad (como prestigio o autoridad moral, ejemplo, y no tanto como mero ejercicio del poder), la personalización de la enseñanza, la trascendencia de la comunidad de origen (a la sociedad) y por último, la alternancia entre escuela y sociedad, trabajo y estudio.<br>

Abstract: La destruction symbolique du corps (similaire à la promotion de la latinisation,
latinx.ua 拉丁イヒ）chez Lu Xun est différente des représentations dualisantes de la
Nouvelle littérature des années 1920, opposant à l'âme souffrante le corps déprécié,
qui expriment ainsi directement leurs frustrations. Pourtant, Lu Xun n'est pas un
« contempteur du corps », même si ceiui-ci tend à servir surtout « l'esprit » (voir Gao
2007 :181). Il vise le Kôrper, non le Leib, insistant avec Nietzsche sur le processus
de vie (leben) et le rejet du désir de mort, mais rejetant l'esthétique du corps et du
surhomme. Lu Xun combat le corps comme expression figée et obstacle à la vie, pour
contrer la souffrance de cette impossibilité à régénérer la voix. Cependant, le corps
littéraire, par sa destruction symbolique et sa mise à distance comme signe, laisse
soupçonner une ultime aliénation du corps. Car, si le corps individuel comme « lieu
ou scène de la manifestation [d'un] trouble » est « premier signifiant mis en œuvre par
le langage » (StarobinsKi 1981:273), comment comprendre qu il soit tu ？ C'est peut-
être la dernière souffrance, celle du corps muet, obligé de demeurer un signe statique
interdit de parole individuelle, au nom de la dénonciation du silence collectif et du
refus de l'épanchement.<br>

Abstract: The paper explores the meaning of conversion for African Christians in South Africa by looking at some of the indigenous terms that have populated the Christian vocabulary. The paper focuses on terms like
         ukuguquka, ukukholwa, ibandla, ikholwa, igqobhoka, inkonzo,andinkolo. These terms are found among people who speak Nguni languages. It shows how they were used in pre-Christian context and traces their evolution in Christian contexts. Research conducted in the Reformed Presbyterian Church, St John’s Apostolic Faith Mission, and Methodist Churches in Cape Town between 1997 and 2001 has indicated that conversion was not a simple religious process but involved diverse political, economic and social aspects. Conversion involved a transformation of an African Christian identity from the margins to the centre. It also involved extensive negotiation of what it means to be Christian through the translation of Christian content into an African idiom. The paper goes through various terms and how their original meanings were discarded for new ones.<br>

Abstract: Many parallels can be drawn between organizational and individual pathologies. We believe that the fantasies of top executives and the neurotic styles to which they give rise are important determinants of the nature of organizational dysfunctions. This is particularly true in centralized organizations where the top executives have a major impact upon organizational climate, structure, strategy and even the selection of the environment; and, where organizational recruitment and promotion processes ensure uniformity, or at least conformity, among the top ranks of executives. Using an empirically derived taxonomy, we have isolated five common pathological organizational types and related each of these to the fantasies and neurotic styles of their top executives. Each type is shown to reflect a large number of elements of structure and strategy that are consistent with and probably caused by the neurotic style of the cadre of top executives. The types are called paranoid, compulsive, histrionic, depressive and schizoid. Implications for management research and organizational change are discussed.<br>

Abstract: Fieldwork is sometimes marked by experiences of frictions and frustration. Fieldwork with mobile street vendors in an African city may confront the fieldworker with the problem of locating the 'field' and attaining access to it, both spatially and temporally. As I will show by reference to my fieldwork with a group of shoe vendors on the streets of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the frictions that occurred at the beginning of my fieldwork nevertheless ignited a process of ethnographic knowledge-gaining that led me to understand the importance of temporality and rhythmicity for the shoe vendors' practices. In their active engagement with the spatio-temporal landscape of the city, the street vendors organised their practices as an experiential rhythm that unfolded as sequences of rising and subsequently declining cognitive and corporeal tensions. These rhythms did not flow smoothly, but were necessarily interspersed with disturbances and frictions by the rhythms of other pedestrians in the streets, whose attention the street vendors tried to attain.<br>

Abstract: Based on the experience of a course taught by the authors, this paper seeks to show that an adequate use of IT in the teaching of a Business Etchics (BE) course depends on clarifying the assumptions about ethics and the place of the course within a programme. For this purpose it explains how IT can be used to strengthen a view of BE based on dialogue and mutual learning and it encourages the combination between virtual and face-to-face teaching. Finally, the paper examines the relationship between the use of IT, individual learning processes and communities of practice.<br>

Abstract: This article explores how Gayl Jones's "Corregidora" constructs, through the journey of its main protagonist Ursa Corregidora, a viable model for dealing with the painful legacy of slavery, oppression and haunting by the past. The process of self-redefinition in which Ursa engages is based on the reconfiguration of family and sexuality and the hybridization of her relationship to individual as well as collective narratives. After probing Ursa's complex psychological journey, the article examines the main elements mediating the reinscription of her life narrative into a broader context of métissage involving sexual and historical resistance, anchored in the story of Palmares as a Brazilian maroon community (quilombo). Finally, the article analyzes the implications and resonances of this model of revision/reclamation for Gayl Jones and her theorization of the interconnectedness of struggles against oppression in Brazil and the United States.<br>

Abstract: In this semiotic analysis of the Spanish auto defe, we begin to understand for the first time the meaning of religious rituals that have appeared completely incomprehensible in traditional accounts. The morning processions of penitents through city streets, the formal denunciations of heretics on public scaffolds, and the final burning at the stake of unrepentant sinners are placed within the context of medieval penitential practices and eschatological beliefs. The ceremony of the auto defe unveiled in time the Judgment Day awaiting all humankind at the end of time. For this reason, the spectacle aroused the interest of spectators all over Christendom, filling them with apprehension of their own final judgment.<br>

Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: Cet article aborde un aspect du processus d'interprétation de la vie religieuse ou cloîtrée amorcé au sein des communautés religieuses catholiques romaines dans les années '70. On avance que, durant cette période de transition, on a fait l'expérience d'un rejet massif du concept de "cloître" en tant que clôture au sens physique, en soulignant le fait qu'il y avait là plus qu'une simple modification de la pratique communautaire, axé sur une réalité transcendante de caractère utopique qu'on aurait voulu orientée en direction d'une expérience communautaire de caractère profane. En fait, ce type de rejet apparaît comme une transformation du concept de "cloître," ne niant point le fait de la continuité au niveau de l'identité communautaire. Les religieuses catholiques romaines ont eu recours à deux images de pointe: la fiancée éternelle du Christ et le clown, ou bouffon, du monde profane. /// This paper examines one aspect of the interpretive process undertaken by religious communities of North American Roman Catholic sisters in the 1970s, or the redefinition of cloister. It is suggested that during this transitional period, widespread rejection of the concept of cloister as physical enclosure was more than a mere illustrative shift away from a communal paradigm stressing utopian transcendence, and toward a communal paradigm identified as profane. In fact, this rejection signaled a transformation in the concept of cloister that allowed for continuity in communal themes of identity across contrasting paradigms. To effect this transformation, Roman Catholic sisters contrasted two liminal images: the transcendent Bride of Christ, and the profane clown.<br>

Abstract: A partir d'une étude menée en avril 2003 auprès de trois ONG guatémaltèques impliquées dans le processus de paix, cet article cherche à interroger les registres dominants en ce qui concerne les modalités de réconciliation de pays ayant connu la guerre. En étudiant les registres locaux de la reconstruction du "vivre-ensemble", l'économie morale et politique dans laquelle ils s'inscrivent, et les champs du discours auxquels ils renvoient, je veux montrer les limites que pose un contexte encore répressif aux approches et pratiques actuellement en vogue dans le domaine de la paix et de la réconciliation. /// Based on a study conducted within three NGOs involved in the Guatemalan peace process, this article interrogates dominant discourses and practices upon which strategies of reconciliation in postwar countries are based. Examining local idioms of the reconstruction of the principle of "living together," and in particular the moral and political economy in which these idioms are embedded and the discursive fields to which they refer, enables us to identify the obstacles that a repressive political context may impose on processes of peace-building and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against the all too common dichotomy of globalization into a process of homogenization or a process of significant diversification. The paper seeks to bridge this dichotomy by arguing for the relative autonomy of culture with respect to global political-economy, for the plurality of voices that constitute ongoing social interaction, and for a vision of actors operating in fields of power that position human agents differentially. The essay makes use of world systems theory to illustrate the merits and problems of global analysis while focussing on the ethnographic examples of French and Michigan wine growers. /// L'article s'inscrit en faux contre la vision dichotomique et récurrente de la mondialisation selon laquelle il s'agit soit d'un processus d'homogénéisation, soit d'un profond processus de diversification. L'article cherche à surmonter cette dichotomie en soutenant l'existence d'une autonomie relative des cultures face à l'économie politique mondiale, d'une pluralité des voix qui constituent les interactions sociales en cours et d'une vision qui situe les acteurs au sein de cercles de pouvoir qui leur imposent des positions différentielles. L'essai se sert de la théorie des systèmes-monde pour illustrer le bien-fondé et les défauts des analyses de niveau mondial. Il met l'accent sur des exemples ethnographiques de viticulteurs de la France et du Michigan.<br>

Abstract: Discussions of post-processual archaeology are summarized in order to suggest that historical archaeology is in a particularly good position to answer the post-processual critiques of the "new" archaeology and to create a contextual archaeology that is both historically and anthropologically informed and relevant. The work of four scholars is noted as particularly influential in the development of post-processual approaches.<br>

Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: The attentions given to textual production in composition scholarship have led to a neglect of the dynamics of textual reception. Renewed acquaintance with the discipline of hermeneutics will provide scholars and instructors with a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between interpretive processes and rhetorical strategies. Building on the work of Phelps, Mailloux, and Crusius, this article revisits Gadamer and Ricoeur, two of the more prominent scholars of modern hermeneutics, for the purpose of applying their principles to learning objectives and class assignments in college-level writing courses.<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how, in a southern Irish setting, differences based on the historic struggles between Protestantism and Catholicism are perpetuated and communicated. It outlines the background and identifies modes of speech indicating unexamined assumptions grounded in the collective memory of the past. It analyses the ways in which the irruption into everyday communication of this emotional legacy reproduce difference, and examines Protestant perceptions that Catholics see them as incapable of possessing an authentic national identity. It shows how the process results in Protestant exclusion from the imagined nation and the category of 'Irishness'.<br>

Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Kolbe murió en un «búnker de inanición» del campo de exterminio de uschwitz. Entregó voluntariamente su vida a cambio de la de otro prisionero que era padre de familia. l suplicio del hambre (inanición absoluta) duró catorce días, en los que fallecieron seis condenados; uego, una inyección letal liquidó a los tres moribundos restantes, que «tardaban» demasiado. Así acabó olbe. La pena se dictó como castigo colectivo por la fuga de otro preso del bloque

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: Through the experience of some ethnographic fields between France and Italy, Tuscany and the Alps, this paper reflects upon the potential of oral history and biography both as cognitive sources and as heritage assets contributing to the processes of improving the cultural values. In particular, we try to clarify the relationship between regional research projects, exhibitions and archiving processes of the sources of ethnographic research. This in relation to the development of new technologies including the web and to the social and cognitive potential use of oral sources in the capitalization and sharing of research materials with cultural communities and within their possible uses for the scientific community. What can become an anthropological interview once recorded, stored and catalogued? What is the potential of these audio recordings and their written versions within projects of participatory museography? How can the web offer new opportunities to those sources by including them in a global system of dialogue between archives? This view changes the responsibilities and possibilities of the researcher producer of sources and collector of voices, engaging him in a quite different consideration of his work to the benefit of societal projects.<br>

Abstract: An existential-phenomenological description of everyday consumer experiences of contemporary married women with children is offered. An idiographic case study provides a thick description of this phenomenon and illustrates the hermeneutic process used in the interpretation. Following the case study, three interpretive themes are presented as mutually related aspects of an experiential gestalt that is shaped by the contextual ground of participants' life-world situations. Viewed holistically, the thematic aspects exhibit several dialectical relations that can be understood in terms of the emergent meaning of free choice. The applicability of this experiential gestalt to other life-world contexts is discussed.<br>

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive firms are composed of multiple communities with specialized expertise, and are often characterized by lateral rather than hierarchical organizational forms. We argue that producing knowledge to create innovative products and processes in such firms requires the ability to make strong perspectives within a community, as well as the ability to take the perspective of another into account. We present models of language, communication and cognition that can assist in the design of electronic communication systems for perspective making and perspective taking. By appreciating how communication is both like a language game played in a local community and also like a transmission of messages through a conduit, and by appreciating how cognition includes a capacity to narrativize our experience as well as a capacity to process information, we identify some guidelines for designing electronic communication systems to support knowledge work. The communication systems we propose emphasize that narratives can help construct strong perspectives within a community of knowing, and that reflecting upon and representing that perspective can create boundary objects which allow for perspective taking between communities. We conclude by describing our vision of an idealized knowledge intensive firm with a strong culture of perspective making and perspective taking, and by identifying some elements of the electronic communication systems we would expect to see in such a firm.<br>

Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Abstract: A number of investigators are agreed that the popular medical systems of tribal, peasant, and allied peoples are "effective." Most of the literature closely examining that effectiveness focuses on the ethnopharmacological dimensions of the healing systems and generally ignores psychosocial factors. Recent developments in psychophysiology may offer insights into these neglected areas. The specific idea to be examined here is that successful "general medical treatment," or "symbolic healing," by either the shaman or physician, is based in part on a psychosocial mobilization of the patient's biochemical response system. Moreover, it is argued that to account fully for these processes we must reconceptualize the character of the human organism; a unitary alternative to standard Western Cartesian dualism (mind vs. body) is proposed, based on a model derived from recent research in neuroendocrinology. This model can be the basis for a nonreductionist theory of medical effectiveness needed to account for a series of observations (derived from both anthropological and medical contexts) which seem to transcend the explanatory powers of the traditional reductionist biomedical model.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on hermeneutics and dialogue, this article clarifies the distinctive contribution that pastoral and psychotherapeutic interventions have to make in the healing process. It is shown how the hermeneutical process discloses the meaning of events through the interpretation of texts that arise spontaneously in the lives of individuals and groups. Texts may range from individual fantasies and dreams to sacred histories recorded in scriptures. When the meaning of life events is explored in dialogue through symbolic texts, we term that process "dialogical hermeneutics." Effective dialogical hermeneutics requires the use of three techniques: (1) presence in the caring relationship, (2) dialogue toward meaning, and (3) offering alternative interpretation.<br>

Abstract: While individual and group psychotherapy are often referred to as forms of secular confession, the relationship of early religious confessional practices to the psychology of contemporary helping group processes needs further exploration. An examination of the theology and form of the Catholic rites of reconciliation indicates that their psychology and structure clearly parallel many of the healing processes at work in group psychotherapy.<br>

Abstract: Garifuna religion is derived from a confluence of Amerindian, African and European antecedents. For the Garifuna in Central America, the spatial focus of authentic religious practice has for over two centuries been that of their former homeland and site of ethnogenesis, the island of St Vincent. It is from St Vincent that the ancestors return, through spirit possession, to join with their living descendants in ritual events. During the last generation, about a third of the population migrated to the US, especially to New York City. This departure created a new diasporic horizon, as the Central American villages left behind now acquired their own aura of ancestral fidelity and religious power. Yet New-York-based Garifuna are now giving attention to the African components of their story of origin, to a degree that has not occurred in homeland villages of Honduras. This essay considers the notion of 'leaving' and 'joining' the African diaspora by examining religious components of Garifuna social formation on St Vincent, the deportation to Central America, and contemporary processes of Africanization being initiated in New York.<br>

Abstract: A presente análise do conto "Seqüência", do livro Primeiras estórias, de Guimarães Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estruturação das "estórias" do autor. Esses enredos mobilizam, de uma maneira geral, o motivo da viagem e, de uma maneira particular, o percurso do eterno retorno. Nesse trajeto estrutura-se a travessia por um rito de passagem, cujo desfecho dá-se, com uma espécie de sobrelevação lendária, numa paisagem mítica. Para perfazer esse processo, o autor parte de um motivo da cultura popular que acaba amalgamado ao universo da tradição erudita, por meio de referências à tradição da história do gênero da narrativa e de seus códigos míticos. /// This analysis of "Seqüência", a short story from the book Primeiras estórias, by Guimarães Rosa, aims at showing a recurrent device used in the author's stories. These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.<br>

Abstract: International and national agendas are redesigning the terms of intellectual-property (IP) Laws to create cultural property for developing nations. Debates over IP and cultural-property "rights" or legal needs for "protection" are critical to anthropology's effort to reflect on how the production of knowledge, even culture itself, is variously construed to originate with, or "belong to," particular individuals, ethnic communities, or nation-states. We explore the implications of two Indonesian legal documents to show the disjunction between discourses of regional artists who describe the ritual exchanges, relationships, and transgenerational messages their arts shape and (inter)nationalists legal initiatives that bypass artists' concepts of process, access, and authority in an effort to disembed and control ritual-based expressions as products with exclusive owners.<br>

Abstract: With the portrayal of local resentment towards the massive influx of Silesian refugees after WWII in the GDR in his novel Landnahme, Christoph Hein expands the literary representation of history he began earlier in Horns Ende, again using the fictional small town of Guldenberg as paradigmatic for the GDR, extended here over time to include unified Germany. Bernhard Haber's epic, but unscrupulous struggle to overcome the will of his neighbors for him to fail provides the backdrop for Hein's depiction of how the past unavoidably writes the future and how the collective process of socialization shapes meanings and values. Using five narrators, Hein applies his earlier concept of social autobiography to trace historical developments in the acquired collective attitudes of Germans towards Gypsies, Poles, the handicapped, and African and Vietnamese workers left behind after unification, all of whom were subjected to the same abusive language and discrimination directed at the refugees.<br>

Abstract: How can an interpretive theory gain legitimacy in two cultural markets as different as France and the United States? This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France.<br>

Abstract: This article pleads for a pragmatic strategy of transcultural understanding as a dialogic concept of insight in social geographic research in the „Islamic Orient“. Transcultural understanding is interpreted as a process of assimilating different systems of meaning, norms, and values of subjects on the one hand, and discourses on how those systems fit together on the other hand (cf. Schwemmer 1996). Understanding is organized by scientifically working out common connections respecting and recognizing foreign codes. As it were, social geographic research needs to generate theoretical frames on a common basis in order to take the differences between cultures as a theme afterwards. In preparation of the argument, the concept of the „gelebten Raum“ (Baier 1996), and the post-modern understanding of space in social geography respectively (Claval 1999) is shortly presented. Additionally, a differentiation of the „Islamic Orient“ is outlined, as are the problems of understanding everyday life and social scientific problems of understanding agency.<br>

Abstract: « Le temps présent est devenu éphémère, irréversible et insaisissable »,
dit A. Y. Gourevitch. Il est aussi homogène et orienté. L'historien sovié-
tique ajoute : « Pour la première fois, l'homme a constaté que le temps dont
il ne décelait le cours qu'à travers les événements, ne s'arrête pas, même en
l'absence d'événement. » A. Y. Gourevitch réintroduit ici une acception
métaphysique du temps, s'il entend bien par événements des phénomènes,
alors que dans le reste de sa contribution, il paraît convaincu de la maté-
rialité du temps. La preuve expérimentale de l'existence du temps hors des
phénomènes n'a pas été fournie et ne peut l'être. Les temps dans lesquels
nous vivons, sont celui de notre existence même, celui de notre société, celui
des mouvements des astres, etc. L'homme ne « constate » donc pas que le
temps ne s'arrête pas même en l'absence d'événement, ces événements lui
sont cachés par l'usage d'un temps quantitatif qui se réfère à l'un d'entre
eux exprimé par les horloges, devenu la référence unique, apparemment
« dématérialisé » par son omnipotence et occultant l'existence des autres
temps.<br>

Abstract: Individual agency is necessary for the possibility of rhetoric, and especially for deliberative rhetoric, which enables the composition of what Latour calls a good common world. Drawing on neurophenomenology, this essay defines individual agency as the process through which organisms create meanings through acting into the world and changing their structure in response to the perceived consequences of their actions. Conceiving of agency in this way enables writers to recognize their rhetorical acts, whether conscious or nonconscious, as acts that make them who they are, that affect others, and that can contribute to the common good. Responsible rhetorical agency entails being open to and responsive to the meanings of concrete others, and thus seeing persuasion as an invitation to listeners as also always agents in persuasion.<br>

Abstract: Maurice Leenhardt's ethnographic work in New Caledonia spanned nearly half a century, from 1902-1948. The first part of this field research is described and analysed, as background to his later anthropological writings. Leenhardt's specific position as a missionary-ethnographer is discussed, its advantages and disadvantages weighed. A liberal missionary perspective is found, in this case, to be conducive to a portrayal of cultural process. Leenhardt's translation methodology and his relations with key informants are detailed. Transcription, the means by which ethnographic texts are constituted by more than a single subject, is speculatively extended to ethnographic practice generally. Field research may be seen as a collective, reciprocal endeavour through which textualised translations are made. This viewpoint calls into question common notions of description, interpretation and authorship in the writing of ethnography.<br>

Abstract: Muslims, and other people whose religions are based in scripture, develop and transform stories from scripture to explain local practices in world-religious terms, yet anthropologists seldom study these processes. This article concerns elaborations on Islamic traditions by Gayo people in highland Sumatra, Indonesia. Gayo narrators draw on stories of Adam and Eve's children to account for processes of birth, hunting and agriculture. Special attention is given here to the functions played by ideas of sibling conflict, improper marriage, and gender in these narrative transformations.<br>

Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Abstract: The appearance of diverse strands of post-processual archaeology resonates with the transformation of university structures, beginning in the 1970s, and gives voice to concerns that have been variously labelled post-structuralist, deconstructionist or critical theory. This article examines the resonance of the post-processual archaeologies with wider social and intellectual currents in the context of the ongoing confrontation with processual archaeology, attempts at a critical engagement with structuralism and symbolic anthropology, and rapprochement with history. It considers the implications of these perspectives.<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks further to define the processes of the interpretation of meaning in archaeology and to explore the public role such interpretation might play. In contrast to postmodern and poststructuralist perspectives, a hermeneutic debate is described that takes account of a critical perspective. An interpretive postprocessual archaeology needs to incorporate three components: a guarded objectivity of the data, hermeneutic procedures for inferring internal meanings, and reflexivity. The call for an interpretive position is related closely to new, more active roles that the archaeological past is filling in a multicultural world.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and theorize the topology of 'vision' in field ecology, a domain considerably different from laboratory work in the physical sciences, and discuss the temporal extension of data-collection practices. Data collection in this field is characterized by widely varying measurements, measurement dimensions and temporal extension of data collection. We present the ecologists' field laboratory as a perceptual machinery with a heterogeneous and heteromaterial topology as it pertains to measures, precision, replication and other material practices. Because of the complexity of ecological fieldwork, considerable co-ordination and articulation work is necessary. Here, tables, tags and labels are central tools to achieve coherence of inscriptions. We topicalize the work that digitizes measurements conducted on lizards and their habitats, and that therefore imposes signs that lend themselves to mathematical and statistical processes. It is only through these digitizing processes that lizards become visible to other (interested) ecologists, most of whom have not seen this particular animal species in person. We thereby contribute in new ways to discussions of the topography and topology of scientific vision, to the relation of measurement to practice, and to the 'adequation' of nature and mathematics.<br>

Abstract: This paper discusses semantic aspects of noun incorporation in Akwesasne Mohawk, one of six Northern Iroquoian languages spoken today. Meanings of verb stems with incorporated nouns are shown to range from literal referents of transitive action to abstract, nontangible metaphors. NI is examined as the structural means through which novel semantic units are formed. These new units expand the interpretative range of basic meanings as part of creative linguistic and conceptual processes. Metaphors are created to fulfill lexical and poetic functions. Data are presented and analyzed from body part and other semantic domains.<br>

Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Abstract: Traditional discourses upon literature have been predicated upon the ability to refer to a text that others may consult (Landow, 1994, p. 33). Texts that involve elements of feedback and nontrivial decision-making on the part of the reader (Aarseth, 1997, p. 1) therefore present a challenge to readers and critics alike. Since a persuasive case has been made against a critical method that sets out to "identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and territorial mastery" (Aarseth, p. 87), this paper proposes the use of readers in an empirically based approach to hypertext fiction. Meta-interpretation, a method that combines individual responses to a text, reading logs, screen recordings and limited qualitative/quantitative analysis, and critical interpretation is outlined. By analysing readers' responses it is possible to suggest both the ways that textual elements may have influenced or determined readers' choices and the ways that readers' choices "configure" the text. The method thus addresses Espen Aarseth's concerns and illuminates interesting features of interactive processes in fictional environments. The paper is divided into two parts: the first part sketches out meta-interpretation through consideration of the main problems confronting the literary critic; the second part describes reading research aimed at generating data for the literary critic.<br>

Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Abstract: Of the many surviving Romanesque cartularies, very few are illuminated. After reviewing general considerations of the oral, textual, and visual elements at play in these works, this paper then focuses on the Vierzon Cartulary, particularly on the processes of its charters' transcription to codex. Specifically, this paper argues the performative role of the scribe and illuminator, who, by their transformation of the mise-en-page, appropriation of papal notarial authority, and translation of sealing practice, participated in a new diplomatic ceremony of conveyance. This paper advances a reconsideration of text-image relations to account for ritual performance, both actual and symbolic.<br>

Abstract: Computer-mediated communication (CMC) can spark students' interest and develop their cross-cultural communication skills. This article describes an on-going CMC cross-cultural project, "Images, Myths, and Realities across Cultures" (IMRAC), between French and American university students. The possibilities and limits of CMC are explored using the research of Claire Kramsch and Paul Ricœur, who provide a practical and theoretical framework in which to analyze student-authored writing. A three-fold articulation of self emerges as students participate in IMRAC. Through a process of mediation, the discussions on the chats offer students a praxis, a way of being that can contribute to making them more culturally literate citizens.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first- and third-person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue in ethnographies. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that hinges on splitting subject/object and process/product. Both splits are antithetical to dialogue in defining relationships between self and social life. A dialogic approach is developed through use of indexing in social distance, and discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life are traced out.<br>

Abstract: The recent turbulent events in the Middle East indicate the importance and the challenges of uniting citizens in each of these countries in some commonly known story of who they are and from whence they have come. A consciously constructed sense of collective history is one especially fertile ground from which stories of national identity can be drawn. This article interprets a set of symbols displayed in a political drama in one particular Turkish small town. Following Ricoeur's analyses of ideology, it shows how sentiments of national identity are created and maintained in seemingly small ways. The symbols and processes which affirm identity, however, concomitantly disguise and distort other expressions of the historic situation. Although distortions may be the result of benign processes of signification, they may also be manipulated to favor the needs and desires of persons and groups which seek to maintain power and influence.<br>

Abstract: The natural science model has fostered fragmentation among the human sciences, leaving them ill-equipped to address matters of public policy which demand more holistic approaches. This paper proposes a science of political ethics which could encompass factual, normative, and value materials. Ricoeur's processes of guessing, explanation, and comprehension are used to develop a theory of interpretation for the new science. The work of art is used as the metaphor for interpreting societal processes.<br>

Abstract: Concerns with how cultural factors influenced agrarian social change remained an abiding interest in the work of James Scott. I begin by sketching out the context of debates in Marxist theory, development studies, and social and political anthropology that, during the 1980s, turned to relations between ideas, power, and processes of conflict and change in a world of new postcolonial nations and rapid agrarian development. In the article, then, I carefully examine the ideas Scott developed about resistance and hegemony in conversation with the work of E. P. Thompson. Tracing the genealogy of Scott's ideas about hegemony and rural social protest, I comment in some detail on the literature on resistance that arose in anthropology during the 1980s and the role of Scott's "Weapons of the Weak" (1985) in shaping that literature while interacting with "Subaltern Studies" (Guha 1982-87), studies of social movements, and examinations of power in interpersonal relations.<br>

Abstract: Beginning in the 1970s there has been a shift in cultural anthropological methodology from participant observation toward the observation of participation. During participant observation ethnographers attempt to be both emotionally engaged participants and coolly dispassionate observers of the lives of others. In the observation of participation, ethnographers both experience and observe their own and others' coparticipation within the ethnographic encounter. The shift from the one methodology to the other entails a representational transformation in which, instead of a choice between writing an ethnographic memoir centering on the Self or a standard monograph centering on the Other, both the Self and Other are presented together within a single narrative ethnography, focused on the character and process of the ethnographic dialogue.<br>

Author(s): Walkerdine Valerie<br>
Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Abstract: Using life narrative interviews with Arab students with Israeli citizenship collected in 1997-98, I inquire into the processes and problems in talking about one's collective identity. In particular, I address how Arab students manage multiple identifications and the role of social relationships in shaping identity narratives. First, I argue that identity narratives do not voice a single point of view. Rather, identity narratives articulate multiple affiliations that, often, cohere in an uneasy fashion. Our identities are not incoherent, but such multiplicity provides the opportunity for talking about identity in novel ways. Second, I argue that social relationships are an integral part of identity stories that work to introduce, close off, balance, and rebalance possible self-identifications. In talking about identity, we narrativize our social relationships, and these narrated relationships are key points in the plotline of our identity stories. Drawing on this interpretation, I argue that social policies that equalize power relations and allow for the creation of social relationships based on mutual respect have the potential to shape identities that, without giving up valued affiliations, contain an acceptance of the other at their core.<br>

Abstract: I discuss several conceptual problems raised by current understandings of political violence, especially as they pertain to actions, motivations, and identities in civil wars. Actions "on the ground" often turn out to be related to local and private conflicts rather than the war's driving (or "master") cleavage. The disjunction between dynamics at the top and at the bottom undermines prevailing assumptions about civil wars, which are informed by two competing interpretive frames, most recently described as "greed and grievance." Rather than posit a dichotomy between greed and grievance, I point to the interaction between political and private identities and actions. Civil wars are not binary conflicts, but complex and ambiguous processes that foster the "joint" action of local and supralocal actors, civilians, and armies, whose alliance results in violence that aggregates yet still reflects their diverse goals. It is the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil wars with their particular and often puzzling character, straddling the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.<br>

Abstract: Memory, persistence, and cultural transmission are hot topics in anthropology today. Contributing to an increasing anthropological interest in youth agency, in this article I invite readers to look at youth as a crucial site for understanding issues of religious memory and cultural transmission. In the past five decades, Bulongic people (Guinea-Conakry) have undergone significant religious changes caused by the introduction of Islam, which has led to the official disappearance of pre-Islamic rituals. In this article, I explore how young Bulongic remember a pre-Islamic past that they have never experienced. I argue that, to understand how they assimilate and perpetuate this religious heritage, one must examine the subtle processes of intergenerational transmission through which their memories are dynamically shaped.<br>

Abstract: Popular music plays important roles in two related films portraying Brazilian slum life. Based on a 1953 play by Vinícius de Morais, Marcel Camus's 1959 film Orfeu Negro, and a 1999 feature by Brazilian director Carlos Diegues titled Orfeu, augment traditional samba styles with bossa nova and rap, respectively. Interpreting musical style as allegorical texts within fictive landscapes, this paper examines conflation and conflict among musical meanings, Brazilian social histories, and discursive identities marking the twentieth century. Broad aspects of Brazilian political and socio-cultural development are implicated, such as authoritarianism, the politics and sociology of race, technological advances, mass media, and modes of modernisation. Here, bossa nova and rap engage society through reflexive and generative interpretations within a narrative designed to illustrate connections between processes of innovative, trans-national cultural production, myths of national identity, social change, and the powerful role of popular music in film.<br>

Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Abstract: The development of the intellectual basis for planning activity has been a slow and problematic process. This paper seeks to build on existing intellectual understanding to argue that future developments in planning thought must take questions of ethical value as their starting point. The paper is essentially divided into three parts. The first makes the important distinction between planning as a narrow set of regulatory practices and planning as an idea, or more particularly a long-enduring societal activity. It is the latter concept of planning that frames the discussion in the remainder of the paper. The second, in which the core of the argument is developed, explores the nature of planning as an activity; an activity that is centrally concerned with making ethical judgements about better and worse, with and for others, in just institutions. It is about an idea of value. The third section examines the implications of this perspective for planning as a subject of academic endeavour. The argument is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from the author's research.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Abstract: Making sense of new information technology (IT) and the many buzzwords associated with it is by no means an easy task for executives. Yet doing so is crucial to making good innovation decisions. This paper examines how information systems (IS) executives respond to what has been termed organizing visions for IT, grand ideas for applying IT, the presence of which is typically announced by much "buzz" and hyperbole. Developed and promulgated in the wider interorganizational community, organizing visions play a central role in driving the innovation adoption and diffusion process. Familiar and recent examples include electronic commerce, data warehousing, and enterprise systems. A key aspect of an organizing vision is that it has a career. That is, even as it helps shape how IS managers think about the future of application and practice in their field, the organizing vision undertakes its own struggle to achieve ascendancy in the community. The present research explores this struggle, specifically probing how IS executives respond to visions that are in different career stages. Employing field interviews and a survey, the study identifies four dimensions of executive response focusing on a vision's interpretability, plausibility, importance, and discontinuity. Taking a comparative approach, the study offers several grounded conjectures con-cerning the career dynamics of organizing visions. For the IS executive, the findings help point the way to a more proactive, systematic, and critical stance toward innovations that can place the executive in a better position to make informed adoption decisions.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we use concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to interpret the sequence of events that led to business process change (BPC) failure at a telecommunications company in the United States. Through our intensive examination of the BPC initiative, we find that a number of issues suggested by ANT, such as errors in problematization, parallel translation, betrayal, and irreversible inscription of interests, contributed significantly to the failure. We provide nine abstraction statements capturing the essence of our findings in a concrete form. The larger implication of our study is that, for sociotechnical phenomena such as BPC with significant political components, an ANT-informed understanding can enable practitioners to better anticipate and cope with emergent complexities.<br>

Abstract: The author suggests that all research is narrative. Resituating all research as narrative, as opposed to characterizing narrative as one particular form of inquiry, provides a critical space for rethinking research beyond current dualisms and bifurcations that create boundaries that limit the capacity for dialogue across diverse epistemologies. The contemporary bifurcation of research as either quantitative or qualitative, or as scientific or nonscientific, has resulted in a master narrative of research which assumes incommensurability across paradigms. The author weaves 3 questions through this research: (a) What is lost when narrative and science are constructed as opposing and incommensurable modes of inquiry? (b) How might scholars reconceptualize inquiry outside a binary framework that privileges science? and (c) In what ways can resituating all narrative as inquiry open spaces for dialogue across multiple epistemologies that is the heart of democratic inquiry? The author concludes by suggesting that narrative is not a method, but rather a process of meaning making that encompasses 3 major spheres of inquiry: the scientific (physical), the symbolic (human experience) and the sacred (metaphysical).<br>

Abstract: How can we understand the social impact of cognitions of a projected future, taking into account both the institutional determinants of hopes and their personal inventiveness? How can we document the repercussions, often contrary to intentions, "back from" such projected futures to the production and transformation of social structures? These are some of the questions to be addressed by a cultural sociology that attempts to look seriously at the effects of a projected future as a dynamic force undergirding social change. In this essay I discuss some of the reasons why the analysis of the future has been so neglected in sociological theory and research, and then sketch a possible framework for reincorporating it that specifies some of the cognitive dimensions of projectivity. In the process, I will show how a focus on future projections can help us make a link between cognition and action in a manner that has so far been neglected in the sociological literature.<br>

Abstract: Vivimos en un contexto de disolución de fronteras en múltiples aspectos, de convergencia e hibridación de tecnologías, de medios de comunicación y de culturas. El contexto es de redimensionamiento del tiempo práctico, de los desplazamientos y de las relaciones entre lo local y lo global. En estos tiempos de interculturalidad, la comunicación juega un rol muy importante; no tanto en su dimensión mediática tecnológica, sino en especial en las dinámicas de mediaciones culturales que se desdoblan de las relaciones mediatizadas. Este trabajo pretende reflexionar sobre las transformaciones de los procesos comunicacionales en la contemporaneidad, marcados por fuertes movimientos de hibridación, así como pensar la interculturalidad en el contexto de las mediaciones culturales, a partir de autores latinoamericanos en diálogo con autores franceses. También, a partir de material de los medios, se presentarán ilustraciones del escenario cultural brasileño, que está marcado por una larga historia de hibridación, llena de dinámicas interculturales. We live in a context of borders that are dissolving in many senses, of the convergence and hybridisation of technologies, mass media and cultures. The context is the resizing of practical time, of movements and links between the local and the global. In these times of interculturality, communication plays a very important role; not so much in its technological media dimension, but particularly in the dynamics of cultural mediations that are dividing off from mediatised relations. This article aims to reflect on the transformations in present-day communication processes, marked by strong movements of hybridisation, as well as examining how to consider interculturality in the context of cultural mediations, based on dialogue between Latin American and French authors. Also, using media material, the article presents illustrations of the Brazilian cultural scene, which is marked by a long history of hybridisation that is filled with intercultural dynamics.<br>

Abstract: Les apports de Jean-Marie Floch au marketing sont nombreux. Cet article ne prétend nullement en rendre compte de façon exhaustive mais tâche plutôt de montrer combien les voies et pistes de recherche qu 'il a initiées ont été fructueuses pour l'ensemble de la communauté marketing et sont d'un recours très fréquent pour aborder les questions de signification. Comprendre le parcours generatif du sens, permettre l'analyse des récits de marque, inscrire dans le lieu de vente ou l'objet les attentes génériques des consommateurs, voici quelques unes des très précieuses idées développées par ce sémillant sémioticien. The contributions of Jean-Marie Floch to marketing are numerous. This paper does not pretend to cover exhaustively this domain but tries to show how the research avenues developed are fruitful for the entire marketing community and are frequently used in order to deal with questions that have to do with signification. Facilitating the understanding of the process of sense generation, allowing the analysis of brand stories, marketing through sales area designs or products the generic requirements of customers, those are some of the precious ideas developed by Floch.<br>

Abstract: The lawyer's crucial role in the contractual process has not been adequately addressed. Transaction cost economics provides a promising approach for doing so, but does not fully account for the lawyer's motivations or intentions. To do so, a more comprehensive theory of human behavior is required. Husserl's phenomenology, specifically his analysis of the natural attitude, provides such a theory. This article describes the role of lawyers in drafting complex entertainment contracts and explains that role in terms of both transaction cost economics and phenomenology. It argues that the two explanations are consistent, but that phenomenology offers additional insights and more fully explains the lawyer's actions.<br>

Abstract: L'expérience professionnelle et humaine de Giovanni Falcone, le juge instructeur du plus spectaculaire procès intenté contre la mafia, nous amène à examiner les relations entre l'enquête judiciaire et l'enquête ethnographique : car c'est grâce à l'instruction du Maxiprocesso (1986) qu'aujourd'hui nous disposons d'une abondante moisson de données sur Cosa Nostra, son fonctionnement, ses règles internes et son code d'honneur. Si la reconstruction d'une vérité au moyen d'indices, dans un monde protégé par l'omertà, apparente les techniques d'investigation du juge au modèle épistémologique qui est au fondement des sciences humaines depuis le XIXe siècle, l'utilisation d'informateurs appartenant à l'univers mafieux — les repentis — est à mettre en parallèle plus directement avec les méthodes de l'ethnographie. The human and professional experience of Giovanni Falcone, the examining magistrate in the most spectacular legal operation launched against the Mafia, makes us examine the relations between the judicial and the ethnographic investigation, for it is due to the inquiries of the Maxiprocesso (1986) that we now possess an abundant source of data on the Cosa Nostra, its operation, its internal rules and its code of honour. While, in a world protected by the omertà, the re-establishment of facts by means of evidence places the investigative techniques of the judge among those of the epistemological model, basis of the human sciences since the 19th century, the use of informers — the pentiti — from the world of the Mafia, on the other hand, reflects more directly the methods of ethnography. Das berufliche und menschliche Erfahrenheit des Untersuchungsrichters Giovanni Falcone im spektakulärsten aller jemals gegen die Mafia durchgeführten Prozesse führt uns zu einer Überprüfung der Beziehungen zwischen gerichtlicher und ethnographischer Untersuchung, denn dank der Voruntersuchung im Maxiprocesso (1986) verfügen wir heute über eine umfangreiche Sammlung von Angaben über die Cosa Nostra, über ihre Arbeitsweise, ihre inneren Regeln und ihren Ehrenkodex. In einer durch die Omertà geschützten Welt gleicht die Vorgehensweise des Richters bei der Aufdeckung der Wahrheit dem epistemologischen Modell, das den Humanwissenschaften seit dem 19. Jahrhundert zugrunde liegt, während die Verwendung von Informanten aus dem Bereiche der Mafia — den Pentiti — sich eher mit den Methoden der Ethnographie vergleichen lässt.<br>

Abstract: En janvier 2003, le Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie ferme ses portes. Ses collections sont transférées au quai Branly, en vue de l'ouverture d'un musée des arts et civilisations d'Afrique, d'Asie, d'Océanie et des Amériques. Différentes campagnes d'enquêtes, réalisées depuis 2000, rendent intelligible ce nouvel épisode de l'histoire mouvementée du palais de la porte Dorée. A partir du triple point de vue de l'institution muséale, du personnel et du public, ces enquêtes éclairent le processus de la fermeture d'un musée « patrimoine national » et de son nouveau destin. La réflexion porte plus précisément sur les liens apparemment contradictoires entre rupture et continuité, clôture et pérennité, pesanteurs du passé et évolution du regard. La création prochaine d'une Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration peut illustrer ces paradoxes. The National Museum of African and Oceanian Arts closed in January 2003. Its collections were transferred to the future Quai Branly Museum of Arts and civilizations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Various survey campaigns carried out since the year 2000 explain this new episode of the eventful history of the Palais at the Porte Dorée. From the threefold point of view of the museum institution, the personnel and the visitors these surveys throw some light on the closure process of a museum belonging to the national patrimony and on its new destiny. The study is focussed on the seemingly contradictory relations between rupture and continuity, closure and durability, heaviness of the past and new look at museums. The future creation of a national city of the history of immigration illustrates these paradoxes. Das nationale Museum der Afrikanischen und Ozeanischen Künste wurde im Januar 2003 geschlossen. Seine Sammlungen wurden in dem zukünftigen Museum der Künste und Zivilizationen aus Afrika, Asia, Okeania und die Amerikas am Quai Branly gebracht.Verschiedene Erhebungen, die seit 2000 durchgeführt wurden, zeigen die Bedeutung dieser neuen Episode der bewegten Geschichte des Palasts Porte Dorée. Aus dem dreifachem Gesichtspunkt der musealen Institution, des Personals und des Publikums ermöglichen diese Erhebungen, die Schliessung eines dem nationalen Erbe gehörenden Museums und sein neues Schicksal zu verstehen. Die Studie konzentriert sich auf die anscheinend widersprüchliche Verbindungen zwischen Bruch und Kontinuität, Schliessung und Fortdauer, Schwerfälligkeit der Vergangenheit und neuem Blick auf die Museen. Die baldige Schöpfung eines internationalen Zentrums der Geschichte der Einwanderung illustriert diese Paradoxe.<br>

Abstract: Le combat juif pour la mémoire du génocide et la reconnaissance finalement obtenue sont devenus un modèle et un cadre référentiel pour d'autres populations persécutées. Mais l'ampleur de cette effervescence mémorielle suscite à son tour des réactions critiques. Quant au modèle, il est parfois contesté de façon virulente par la dérive minoritaire d'une compétition victimaire. Après avoir rappelé le processus à travers lequel ce phénomène mémoriel s'est progressivement imposé, on analysera son rôle référentiel, les critiques qu'il soulève et les controverses dont il fait l'objet. The Jewish fight for the genocide's memory and the recognition it eventually reached have become a model and a referential frame for other persecuted people. Yet in return some react critically to this rising memorial effervescence. As victims compete and minorities conflict, the Shoah model is in itself more and more contested. This article retraces how this memorial phenomenon has progressively settled and analyses its referential, yet controversial, role. Der jüdische Kampf um eine kollektive Erinnerung an die Vernichtung und ihre letztliche Anerkennung sind im Laufe der Zeit zu einer Art Modell und zu einem Bezugsrahmen für andere verfolgte Bevölkerungsgruppen geworden. Jedoch erzeugt die Omnipräsenz der Erinnerungen vielfach auch Kritik. Das Erinnerungsmodell wird von Seiten bestimmter Minderheitenströmungen innerhalb des herrschenden « Opferwettbewerbs » oftmals heftig angegriffen. Zunächst analysiert dieser Artikel den Prozess der Durchsetzung des Phänomens des Sich-Erinnerns, im Anschluss daran wird seine Referenzwirkung diskutiert sowie die Kritik und die Debatte die es hervorruft.<br>

Abstract: Partant du constat que les faits sociaux de mémoire sont portés par des actes de communication, il s'agit ici de dégager les pratiques qui alimentent les formes de « l'agir » socio-mémoriel, aujourd'hui présent en France et ailleurs. Quels processus sont a l'œuvre dans des situations post-génocidaires, souvent aussi post-migratoires, comme dans la Shoah (« Khurbn » en yiddish) par exemple ? Dans le cas d'Ashkénazes, il s'agit d'une reinscription qualitative au sein des cartographies de la parenté, mais aussi d'une reconnexion avec des périodes antérieures au genocide et à l'ethnocide à travers des événements culturels. Since the work of memory cannot exist without inter-subjective exchanges, this paper introduces in the study of memory the concept of « social acting » created by Weber. Attempting to point out the plurality of the practices that feed the various forms of socio-memorial movements present today in France and elsewhere. Which are the processes taking on a very particular aspect in post-genocidal as in post-migratory situations such as after the Shoah (Khurbn in Yiddish) ? In the case of the Ashkenase, these processes are also post-ethnocide and consist in a qualitative re-inscription within genealogical mapping and simultaneously in the long development of a history in which the genocide constitutes a memorial screen as well as actions of re-inscribing and re-connecting with cultural markers associated to periods antedating the genocide and ethnocide. Da Erinnerungsarbeit nicht ohne das Betrachten von zwischenmenschlichem Austausch und sozialer Praxis erfolgen kann, soll im Rahmen dieses Artikels das Webersche Konzept des « Sozialen Handelns » in die Untersuchung von Erinnerungen einbezogen werden. Ausgehend von der Tatsache, dass soziale Erinnerungen durch Kommunikation ausgedrückt werden, möchte dieser Artikel die Vielfalt der Praktiken zeigen, die heute in Frankreich und anderswo die Vielzahl der gesellschaftlichen Erinnerungsbewegungen prägen. Die Erinnerungsprozesse verdeutlichen vor allem die soziale und zeitliche Beziehung zum Anderen. Besonders interessant zu analysieren ist sind Post-Shoah-(Khurbn auf Jiddisch) und Post-Auswanderungs-Erinnerungenen. In diesem Artikel richtet sich das Augenmerk vor allem auf Ashkenasische Juden aus Deutschland, Zentral-und Osteuropa, deren Situation nach dem Ethnozid betrachtet wird. Dabei ist eine qualitative Wiederaufnahme der Lebenspraxis der Elterngeneration zu beobachten ; ebenso wie ein Anknüpfen im Rahmen bestimmter kultureller Riten an die Zeit vor dem Völkermord.<br>

Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: The proposition is that arts marketing should be conceived of as a dedicated field of endeavour so that consumers' immersion in the artistic experience occurs even in the case of a "difficult" art work. The focus is artistic experience-related phenomena. The authors introduce the concept of appropriation and then develop an appropriation cycle construct. Empirical research comprises introspective reports on consumer attendance at classical music concerts. The results show that the artistic experience is predicated on multiple rather than one-time immersion, and that full immersion may never occur. The authors conclude that those service elements that affect the way in which consumers experience an arts event should be managed throughout the appropriation process. Les auteurs proposent de concevoir le marketing des arts comme un domaine d'activité spécifique, afin que l'immersion des consommateurs dans l'expérience artistique soit possible même dans le cas d'une œuvre « difficile » . L'accent est mis sur les phénomènes liés à l'expérience artistique. Ils présentent le concept d'appropriation, puis développent un construit du cycle d'appropriation. Ils ont recours à la recherche empirique, soit les rapports d'analyse introspective des consommateurs ayant assisté à des concerts de musique classique. Les résultats indiquent que l'expérience artistique suppose de multiples immersions, non pas une seule, et que l'immersion totale risque de ne jamais se produire. Les auteurs concluent que les éléments du service qui influent sur l'expérience individuelle d'un événement artistique devraient être gérés tout au long du processus d'appropriation. Los autores proponen la idea de que el márketing de las artes debe concebirse como un emprendimiento en sí mismo, a fin de lograr la inmersión del consumidor en experiencia artística incluso en el caso de obras de arte "difíciles". El acento, entonces, está puesto en los fenómenos que se vinculan con la experiencia artística. Los autores presentan el concepto de apropiación y elaboran luego un modelo teórico de ciclo de apropiación. Por otra parte, analuzan los resultados de uno investigación empírica basada sobre los relatos introspectivos realizados por consumidores luego de asistir a conciertos de música clásica. Dichos resultados indican que la experienca artística toma forma con múltiples inmersiones y no sólo con una, y que la inmersión total puede no darse jamás. Los autores llegan a la conclusión de que el proceso de apropiación es el abordaje más idóneo para manejar aquellos elemontos del servicio que afectan la forma en que el consumidor experimenta un evento artístico.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une enquête effectuée auprès d'élèves de Quatrième, Troisième, Seconde et Première, on propose un modèle intermédiaire d'appropriation de l'histoire. En utilisant les classificateurs expérimentés en sémantique cognitive, on peut ramener à deux grandes catégories cognitives, l'identification du texte de l'histoire : l'une de type événement-changement s'inscrit dans un schéma narratif, l'autre de type entité stable dans un intervalle temporel met en œuvre des processus de catégorisation. Les événements, concepts et entités de l'historien ne correspondent pas toujours aux modes de perception des élèves. Ces derniers procèdent par catégorisation naturelle en multipliant les analogies entre des périodes historiques différentes, en ancrant les informations nouvelles dans une pensée sociale. How do secondary school students get in contact with historical texts ? Examples drawn from an investigation are used to present identification processes as a change-event or as lasting entities in a time interval, analogical categorization processes and social thinking rooting.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de l'histoire de la psychologie, la revolution cognitive n'a pas cessé de progresser. Celle qui a cours aujourd'hui cherche à expliquer comment les individus parviennent a donner des significations au monde complexe qui les entoure : il est temps à présent de comprendre différents modes d'élaboration du sens. Quatre modes distincts sont suggérés. Le premier, le mode intersubjectif, concerne l'établissement, le façonnement et le maintien de l'intersubjectivité. Le deuxième, le mode actionnel, concerne l'organisation de l'action. Le troisième, le mode normatif, intègre les éléments particuliers dans des contextes normatifs et s'exprime en imposant des contraintes aux deux premiers modes. Les trois modes ont en commun d'être fortement dépendants du contexte: Les narratifs — ou les récits — sont l'instrument par excellence permettant d'ancrer les trois premiers modes d'élaboration du sens dans un ensemble plus structuré. On peut supposer que le quatrième mode d'élaboration du sens, le mode propositionnel, vise à décontextualiser les trois modes précédents en les soumettant à la vérification et aux justifications logiques. Throughout the entire history of cognitive psychology, a cognitive revolution has always been in progress. The current cognitive revolution began to explain how individuals come to make meaning out of a complex world ; it now needs to turn more vigorously to different forms of meaning making. Four modes are suggested. The first one is directed to the establishment, shaping and maintenance of intersubjectivity. A second form, the actional mode, is concerned with the way action is organized. The third form, the normative mode, construes particulars in normative contexts ; it expresses itself by imposing constraints on the first two modes. These three modes of meaning making have in common to be context dependent. Narratives or stories are the vehicles par excellence for entrenching the first three modes into a more structured whole. It is suggested that the fourth mode of meaning making, the propositional mode, is directed to the decontextualization of the preceeding three modes by imposing verifiability and logical justification. A brief account of how this set of meaning making processes might have grown out of human evolution is discussed. In conclusion : no reductionist theory on mind will do it proper justice.<br>

Abstract: Les processus complexes et souvent paradoxaux que l'alternance met en jeu chez l'apprenant se révèlent de possibles points d'appui des apprentissages signifiants. Une pédagogie qui ne tente pas de les éliminer amène alors à concevoir le travail de l'enseignant comme un travail de médiation elle aussi paradoxale. Une telle conception de l'alternance, loin d'enfermer celle-ci dans un rapport sclérosant à la tradition et sans pour autant l'en couper, montre en quoi l'articulation d'espaces et de temps contradictoires peut être pédagogiquement dynamique. Ce qui, en retour, ne manque pas d'interroger l'enseignement/apprentissage dans l'école dite traditionnelle. Complex and often paradoxical processes elaborated by the learner in an alternation situation may help realizing relevant learning. When pedagogy doesn't try to eliminate them, teacners'work can be conceived of as a mediation activity equally paradoxical. In such a conception, alternation is not separated from tradition but not blocked by it either. It shows to what extend links between contradictory spaces and periods of time may be educationally dynamic. Which, in return, asks questions concerning teaching/learning in a traditional school.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's libertarian ideals into a political agenda; secondly, an attempt to change to solid state with the 1989's Orientation Act (act laying down the basic principles for government action in education) and the creation of the "Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective" (assessment & futurology office); finally, the destabilisation of this system by Claude Allègre, the then French education secretary who put the French educational system into the picture of international competition. A period of doubts "under influence" followed right after. Es handelt sich darum, mehrere in den letzten 30 Jahren vorgefundenen Verwandlungen aufzuklären: zunächst die Gründung eines Expertenmilieus zwischen Politik, Verwaltung und Forschung. Dann einen Wandel des Rahmens, in dem die Überlegung stattfindet: es geht nämlich weniger darum, über den Zusammenhalt einer Gesellschaft in einem internationalen Rahmen nachzudenken als über die Art und Weise zu überlegen, wie das Land seinen Platz im internationalen Wettbewerb behalten kann. Schließlich einen Wandel der politischen Orientierung: die Bemühung um die Bildung einer Elite wird wieder vorrangig, auch wenn es nicht mehr darauf ankommt, eine kulturelle Tradition zu behalten, sondern seinen Marktanteil zu retten. Der Text bearbeitet diese Entwicklungen in Frankreich und unterscheidet dabei drei Perioden: erstens eine Zeit der „gasförmigen” Politik, in der die Linksparteien versuchen, die anarchistischen 1968er Ideale in ein Regierungsprogramm umzusetzen; zweitens ein Versuch der Verfestigung mit dem Orientierungsgesetz 1989 und die Gründung des Bewertungs- und Forschungsamtes (Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective); drittens eine Destabilisierung dieses Systems durch den Erziehungsminister Claude Allègre, der das französische Schulsystem mit der internationalen Konkurrenz konfrontiert. Darauf folgt eine „unter Einfluß" stehende und zugleich unsichere Periode. Se trata de aclarar varios desplazamientos que se produjeron en los treinta últimos años. Primero, la creación de un medio de expertos intermediarios entre la política, la administración y investigación. Después, un cambio del marco dentro del que se sitúa la reflexión. No se trata tanto de pensar la cohesión de una sociedad en un marco nacional como de la manera en que el país puede mantener su rango en la competencia internacional. Por fin, un cambio de orientación política : la preocupación por la formación de lo más selecto vuelve a ser primordial aunque ya no se trata de mantener una tradición cultural sino de proteger sus cuotas de mercado. El texto estudia estas evoluciones en Francia distinguiendo tres períodos : un período de « política en estado gaseoso » en el que la izquierda intenta transformar los ideales libertarios de 1968 en programa de gobierno ; un intento de pasar al estado sólido con la ley de orientación de 1989 y la creación la Dirección de la evaluación y de la prospectiva ; una destabilización de este sistema por el ministro Claude Allègre que echa el sistema educativo francés en el gran baño de la competencia internacional. De ahí resulta un período a la vez «bajo influencia » y de incertidumbre.<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity of the subject taught. School history holds a special position in didactics due to the complexity of its references (scholarly production, self referencing and public use of history). Set in between passing consensual knowledge on and seeking a critical position, school history objects are still under new questioning that changes with social demands as recent debates on actual competing questions related to memory show it. Therefore school history seems to be a blend of social representations, private knowledge and proven knowledge. For fifteen years, works have enabled us to better define "historical thinking" and the specific cognitive processes that are involved in class (historical time, conceptualization, problematization, construction of explanatory schemes). Conceptualized research have allowed to explore real professional practices and model their "normal" functioning: a subject that favours passing on knowledge telling the truth about the past and being attached to using neutral documents; a subject that has difficulty to coherently link ambitious intellectual purposes (preparing active citizens for tomorrow's world) to class activities often limited to memorizing, recognizing and sorting. That is why we can see a problematic develop which is centered on the difference between intentions and practices. Connecting the notion of adherence to the rules of the "didactical contract" to the other theoretical models of human sciences developed within the research team., the work -done in a still too unfocused way -reveals some important acquired knowledge which could be taken into account in teacher training programmes. Esta nota subraya la especificidad de la disciplina enseñada. La historia escolar ocupa una posición original en el campo de las didácticas por la complejidad de sus referencias (producción sabia, autorreferencia escolar y usos públicos de la historia). Divididos entre una transmisión de conocimientos consensúales y la búsqueda de una postura crítica, los objetos de historia enseñados permanecen sometidos a interrogaciones repetidas a merced de la petición social como lo muestran los debates recientes en torno a las cuestiones relativas a las memorias vivas y competidoras. La historia enseñada aparece así como una mezcla que articula representaciones sociales, saberes privados y conocimientos validados. Desde hace unos quince años, ciertos trabajos permitieron delimitar mejor el "pensar en historia" y los procesos cognoscitivos específicos en juego en la clase (tiempo histórico, conceptualización, problematización, construcción de esquemas explicativos). Investigaciones contextualizadas han permitido explorar las prácticas profesionales efectivas y modelizar su funcionamiento "normal": una disciplina que privilegia la transmisión de saberes que dicen la realidad del pasado y apegada a la neutralidad del texto enseñado; una disciplina a la que le cuesta poner en coherencia finalidades intelectuales ambiciosas (preparar al ciudadano activo en la ciudad de mañana) y actividades en la clase a menudo limitadas a la memorización, la localización y la categorización. Por eso se ve dibujarse en los trabajos actuales, una problemática centrada en las diferencias entre las intenciones y las prácticas. Articulando la noción de sumisión a las reglas del "contrato didáctico" con los otros modelos teóricos de las SHS movilizadas en el seno de los equipos de investigación, los trabajos llevados de manera todavía demasiado dispersada dejan aparecer experiencias ¡mportantes que podrían tomarse en consideración en la formación de los docentes. Dieser Bericht unterstreicht die Besonderheit des Schulfachs Geschichte. Geschichte in der Schule hat eine originale Stellung im Feld der Didaktik wegen der Komplexität ihrer Referenzen (wissenschaftliche Schriften, Referenz für sich selbst in der Schule und öffentliche Benutzung der Geschichte). Zwischen der Verbreitung konsesueller Kenntnisse und der Suche nach einer kritischen Haltung hin-und hergerissen, sind die Lehrinhalte in Geschichte nach wie vor je nach sozialer Anfrage einer ständigen Fragestellung ausgesetzt, wie neulich die Debatten um lebhafte und entgegengesetzte Gedächtnisfragen. Die Geschichte als Schulfach erscheint also als eine Mischung zwischen sozialen Vorstellungen, privatem Wissen und bewährten Kenntnissen. Seit etwa 15 Jahren haben einige Arbeiten es ermöglicht, das „Denken in Geschichte” und die kognitiven Prozesse besser einzuschätzen, die in der Schule auf dem Spiel stehen (historische Zeit, Konzeptualisierung, Problematisierung, Bildung erklärender Schemata). Kontextualisierte Forschungsarbeiten haben es erlaubt, die tatsächlichen Berufspraktiken zu erforschen und „normalen” Betrieb zu modellieren: ein Schulfach, das die Übertragung von Kenntnissen, die die Realität der Vergangenheit beschreibt und großen Wert auf die Neutralität des unterrichteten Textes legt; ein Fach, das sich Mühe gibt, ehrgeizige intellektuelle Zwecke (den aktiven Bürger in der Stadt von morgen mit Werkzeugen bewaffnen) mit Aktivitäten in der Klasse in Kohärenz zu bringen, die sich oft auf Memorisierung, Markierung und Kategorisierung begrenzen. Auf diese Weise kann man in den heutigen Arbeiten beobachten, wie eine Problematik auftaucht, im Mittelpunkt derer die Diskrepanz zwischen Absichten und Praktiken steht. In dem man den Begriff der Unterwerfung zu den Regeln des „didaktischen Vertrags” mit den anderen theoretischen Modellen (in den Sozial-und Geschichtswissenschaften) kombiniert, die in den Forschungsteams benutzt werden, lassen die bisher auf noch zu verstreute Weise geführten Arbeiten wichtige Erwerbungen erkennen, die in der Lehrerausbildung berücksichtigt werden könnten.<br>

Abstract: As the twentieth century comes to an end, and with it a millennium, there has been much heated reflection on the passing age and the period of transition. Among the many characteristic phenomena of modern times, globalization has attracted particularly much attention. The process of European integration may be traced back to ancient times (vide Roman imperialism or Carolingian universalism). Recently, however, globalization has expanded and it has accelerated considerably. The author of this paper focuses on the current, paradoxical coexistence of global tendencies toward integration on the one hand and very clearly manifested, diversifying (or even separatists) national and nationalist tendencies on the other hand. The author analyzes these homogenizing tendencies at the level of media pop culture on the one hand and the increasing, even acute, awareness of diversity, including the diversity of national cultures, on the other hand. She does so within the framework of the symbolic culture concept. Contemporarily, tendencies toward globalization are suspended between the Scylla of uniformizatdon and the Charybdis of diversity. Sociology is particularly qualified to study these phenomena, at both local and universal levels.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Author(s): Waistell Jeff<br>
Abstract: This study investigates how business leaders dynamically narrate their aspirational ethical leadership identities. In doing so, it furthers understanding of ethical leadership as a process situated in time and place. The analysis focuses on the discursive strategies used to narrate identity and ethics by ethnic Chinese business leaders in Indonesia after their conversion to Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. By exploring the use of metaphor, our study shows how these business leaders discursively deconstruct their 'old' identities and construct their 'new' aspirational identities as ethical leaders. This leads to the following contributions. First, we show that ethical leadership is constructed in identity talk as the business leaders actively narrate aspirational identities. Second, the identity narratives of the business leaders suggest that ethical leadership is a context-bound and situated claim vis-à-vis unethical practice. Third, we propose a conceptual template, identifying processes of realisation and inspiration followed by significant shifts in understanding, for the study of aspirational ethical leadership.<br>

Abstract: This paper is about the analysis of the written production of argumentative discourse. Thanks to the technique of collective writing it is possible to observe the process of discourse production. Declarative, strategic and procedural abilities of two non native adults are successively analyzed and compared periodically to those of two young native speakers. This study focuses on only two levels : global and interphrasal organisation of discourse. The organisation of debates in class so as to bring students to build argumentative concepts and help them in their approach of texts (reading and writing) shows the limits of a didactic scheme which relies on oral language practice for the elaboration of written texts.<br>

Trata-se de pontuar, neste processo, o que está verdadeiramente em jogo, ou seja, o ato de configuração e reconfiguração do tempo que encerra a ação interpretativa em Antropologia. This article brings a reflections about the ethnographic method while encapsulating the identity theme describes by the anthropologist, in special, focusing the moral-ethic problem of the searching of the internal coherence of its ethnographic production through the study of the process of the anthropologic knowledge construction. It is to point, in this process, that is really in the play, or, the act of configuration and reconfiguration of time that stops the interpretative action in anthropology.<br>

Abstract: We analyse the French noun livre « book » according to an argumentative conception of language. A summary is presented of the theories of Anscombre (Theory of stereotypes) and of Carel and Ducrot (Theory of semantic blocks), which are used to reveal the argumentative dimensions of livre. Argumentation is argued to derive from a common sense system (Sarfati) leading to the ascription of doxa in language governed by a topohbased device, which corresponds to discursive object. Semiotisation is supported by phenomenological processes: the Indexicality of meaning (Lebas 1999, Cadiot and Visetti 2001) is concerned at the Linguistic level with the construction of semantic forms along three dimensions of meaning, known in the Theory of semantic forms as motifs, profiles, and themes. The contributions of the discursive levels to the constitution of a semantic form are raised in view of the phenomenon of lexical anticipation. What we call "inserted motifs" reveals the genericity of Discursive Formations. In the course of "profiling", these motifs constitute a pre-syntactic zone of stabilisation. The "doxic profiles" allows the construction of topoï by thematisation.<br>

Abstract: This study examines the functions of the bilingual discourse strategy of language alternation in the process of marking boundaries of continuous discourse. The focus is on switched discourse markers -- employed, it is argued, to metalanguage the frame of the discourse. The corpus is comprised of audio recordings of over 20 hours of Hebrew-English bilingual conversation. The strategy of language alternation at discourse markers is illustrated, and the switched discourse markers are classified according to Becker's approach to context (1988b) as a source of constraints on text. This classification is then related to the phenomenon of clustering of discourse markers at discourse unit boundaries in both bilingual and monolingual discourse. Finally, cross-linguistic differences in discourse markers are related to a theory of metalanguage.<br>

Abstract: This study examines how deadlines and time limits for conference talks organize the discourse of consensus among collaborating experimental and theoretical physicists in a university laboratory. Six months of videotaped observations, including two cycles of conference talk preparation, indicate that, as the date of an upcoming conference nears, several things happen. (a) Co-authoring physicists usually have not achieved agreement on all aspects of the findings. (b) They nevertheless direct their energies to constructing a hybrid presentation rhetoric that satisfies the co-authors and fits the talk to the official conference talk time limit. (c) In the process of working through matters of rhetoric -- what to say, what to display visually, what to leave out, and in what order the information should be presented -- the physicists construct a working consensus on matters of physics: theory and experimental data explaining the properties and dynamics of the physical universe.<br>

Abstract: This study employs hermeneutics to illuminate a musical life history. I Made Lebah was a unique individual who lived during a violent and creative time of Bali's history. This paper explores his life through the lens of hermeneutics and identifies music stages through segmented, progressive hermeneutical arcs within his lifelong arc of experience. A consciousness of historical situatedness and an enabling appropriation allowed him to master a number of Balinese music styles and assume the title, "great teacher." The people he worked with, including composers Lotring and Colin McPhee and his lifelong friend, Agung Mandra, all affected him and helped him to acquire a self-awareness, a rapid learning and internalization process, and a sensitivity to reflective hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: A broad conceptual framework is presented for utilizing spirituality in group psychotherapy. The author considers (a) selected concepts and theory relevant to the spiritual aspect of psychotherapy practice; (b) the change in assumptions about the person and the group they imply; (c) the mystical aspects of the listening/observing process; and (d) aspects of the new sciences compatible with spiritual principles. Using a psychospiritual paradigm, the author offers a view of group therapy that emphasizes the therapist as a contemporary mystic, the group as a sacred space, and a return to profound, timeless, nonrelativist spiritual values and goals, nonsensory infinite dimensional experience leading to deep transformation of the self, and the compatibility of contemporary scientific frameworks with spiritual principles that can form the basis of new theorizing and group interpretations.<br>

Abstract: The article develops an understanding of public deliberations during a peace process, focusing on the interaction between the elite level negotiations and the "public peace process." It does so by examining the dialogical mechanisms that are set to work in the public sphere once the elite consider the possibility of identifying the former enemies as allies or friends. These dialogical mechanisms, the author argues, add up to a shift in the manner the public interprets the discourse that regulates its relationship with the elite toward what the author calls, following Paul Ricoeur, 'hermeneutics of suspicion.' Thus, the peace process generates a need for the public to re-examine the terms of understanding that defined its relationship with the former enemy. However this same process might also lead the public to re-examine the terms by which it understands its relationship with the elite.<br>

Abstract: In an empirical study using five real-world creative teams from an advertising agency, participants were given a strategic brief for a new beverage product and asked to design the layout for a print ad. Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apoarent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios. Not coincidentally, as a tentative conclusion, this more flexible team produced the ad judged most successful by advertising professionals. This still-to-be-tested exploratory finding deserves further investigation in future research that embodies various methodological refinements.<br>

Abstract: An increasing number of individuals worldwide are receiving home nursing care from loved ones. Many healthcare professionals are exploring the use of narrative to help family caregivers meet the personal demands of this work. Citing Ricoeur's notion of narrative identity as a social process in which cultural norms and values are negotiated between speaker and audience, this paper argues that health care professionals can assist their clients by viewing narrative as collaboration, not autonomous construction. Collaboration in construction of narrative identity was observed in interactions between family caregivers and public health workers on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. There, caregivers were supported by a dialogic process in which interlocutors explored the cultural values that define and delimit the possibilities for living as caregivers.<br>

Abstract: Improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have led to an "epidemic" of survival. Yet we have limited understanding about the overall ramifications of survival and quality of extended life for this growing population of young people. In this paper I consider lived experiences of longterm survival following cancer in childhood from a social science perspective. I explore young people's negotiations of narrative identity and associated processes of coming to terms with their own subjective position as young adult survivors. Discussion is based on qualitative data collected from 57 young adults in 2000. I focus on three concepts that help to discern ways in which cancer becomes enmeshed in personal identity — the Delta factor, narrative dissonance and narrative repair.<br>

Abstract: Causal explanations of social actions are central to modern as well as to classic sociology. Even in its revised form. the most influential causal theory -- the covering law theory -- has not proved particularly fruitful for the study of social action. But there are alternative and potentially more fruitful theories. This article presents Weber's methodology and critical realism as two different contributions to a generative view of causality in social science which both try to transcend the protracted controversy between a hermeneutic interpretive sociology and a positivistic causal-explanatory sociology. From the generative standpoint. causal explanations are directed not towards the production of empirical correlations between variables or towards the making of predictions on the basis of empirical laws, but towards the uncovering of causal properties and the processes whereby social actions arise out of the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions. meanings. intentions. social contexts and structures.<br>

Abstract: This article suggests that by analyzing vernacular narratives of a community through a qualitative rhetoric approach, we can attempt to understand the social construction of community in unique ways. Vernacular narratives often operate independent of, and even in opposition to, formal definitions put forward in official rhetorics about a particular community. I analyze a collection of vernacular narratives about a Rocky Mountain resort community to explore how a particular group of "locals" make sense of their highly transient community. By discussing how narratives of personal experience can translate into both collective conceptions of community and individual processes of identification, I seek to reveal how both vernacular and formal narratives of community formation can expose and reveal the taken-for-granted ways in which a particular "community" may (in)advertently be open (or closed) to changing as its members change.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Author(s): Zollmann Mary Ann<br>
Abstract: This article explores the thesis that educators are called to define and describe truth morefoundationally than we have ever done before if tve are to facilitate existence that is right, just, correct on both a personal and communal level. This thesis is sourced in ever-deepening attentiveness to, appreciation for, and affirmation of this statement of Adrian van Kaam: "The work of reformation starts in the heart by means of the human spirit; it is the reclamation of the soul, via the spirit, of its innermost form direction. " Suggesting that education which would be truly correctional must, therefore, reach into the very heart of being, the author describes the current paradigm shift from the Newtonian model of what it means to be human with its positivistic approaches to learning to a more Einsteinian or fullfield understanding of human being and its requirement of more formative learning processes. In consonance with the truth of being as full-field, formative correctional education is reflective and experiential, dialogical, narrative in form, and globally inclusive. In her discussion of each of these methodologies, the author illustrates how each one draws us deeper into the truth of who we are and inspires us to be the unique presence that we are in the world. Through such methods and processes, individuals are formed, reformed, and transformed not only in self-appreciation and openness to their own possibilities, but in appreciation for the meaning and value of their existence with others in the world.<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: The article presents an analysis of the concept of „subject“ in ethnography from its historical origins through its development over the span of the 20th century. Furthermore, based on her own experience of different cultures, the author conføonts the implicit Western philosophical background in anthropological conceptualisations of the subject and the ethnographic research with alternative philosophical frameworks, specifically the reflexive approach developed by female anthropologists. The main focus of the text lies on a re-conceptualisation of the ethnographic research as an inter-subjective process, and on a new emphasis on the role of the subject in the culture-productive processes of symbolic negotiation.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider qualitative modulation, the semantic movement of the phonic flow. At the segmental level of verse, phonemes are semantically completed by the lexical meanings of words. This semantic process is parallel to the semantic process of the phonemic flow, but apart from the metrical correspondence between them there is no causal connection, only similar semantic content. In addition to the semantic movement of the phonational flow and the semantic saturation of phonemes, the dynamic of the acoustic process of verse completes the phonic line of the verse, which in itself links occurrences of sonic and tonal modulation.<br>

Abstract: The central point is that Schutz's idealization of reciprocity, the matching of subjective intentions in the public world of interactive behaviour, necessarily involves agents in an ironic process. This is largely because, since they are taking so much for granted, they cannot be aware of what is latent in the intentional perspectives of their social partners. In bringing out the pattern of the irony of inter subjective dialectic, the argument makes plain the importance of pretence as a vital concept in philosophy, sociology and hermeneutics. The article closes with a criticism of naive optimism among purveyors of dialectic, recommending a proper concern with the irreconcilables of tragedy.<br>

Abstract: Two central unresolved problems in labour process theory are the disjuncture between structure and agency and the problem of what constitutes 'good' work. This paper argues that a hermeneutic conception of the self as constructed through narrative provides a resolution to these two issues. Hermeneutics conceptualises the self as neither a solitary entity impervious to the influence of others, nor as a mere reflection of objective structures or 'discourses of power'. Rather, in the process of self-interpretation a person uses socially learnt cultural discourses to construct and reconstruct a coherent sense of narrative-identity. Substantive illustrations are drawn from labour process theory, recent developments in management theory, and some more general studies of the meaning of working.<br>

Abstract: In July 2004, a young woman claimed that she had been attacked on the Paris urban railway system by four Maghrebins and two Africans and that the discovery that she might be Jewish had intensified the character of the attack. For a number of days, the French media were dominated by the case and leading politicians condemned it. The events drew attention to a number of issues concerning culture and identity in contemporary France and the role played in constituting this identity of history and memory. However, it also displayed how the constitution of identity is a selective process in which different elements may be dealt with, either in different ways or omitted altogether. This article explores how in attempting to come to terms with the legacies of anti-Semitism, other areas of history and memory have been neglected, including the legacy of France's colonial empire, and, in particular, her relationship with Algeria.<br>

Abstract: This paper links the ideas of Norbert Elias to the conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that has developed in British industrial and organisational (I/O) sociology. It examines the relevance of power and subjectivity to British I/O sociology and reviews theoretical positions that have influenced this field. Elias's work is examined in some detail, exploring his approach to power, agency, the self, individualisation and discourse. His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the 'networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory. Elias's work also illustrates the need for a lengthier historical perspective than is typically observed in industrial and organisational sociology, and points to the value of studies which look beyond the context of the workplace. Finally, attention is paid to some of the limitations of Elias's work.<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: Metaphorics, the movement and process of metaphor, is distributed in Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as modes generating meaning in each of the novel's five chapters. Each of these modes is linked with the specific "historical" matrix in which it originates, a site which determines the metaphor's structure, its function, and the stylistic effects it produces.<br>

Abstract: A survey of recent books on Reader-Response, broadly defined as any literary theory that investigates the process of reading. This includes not only books by Norman Holland, Stanley Fish, and Wolfgang Iser, long regarded as central figures in the area of Reader-Response, but also discussions of the contribution to this area made by Jacques Derrida and Mikhail Bakhtin. A widespread reaction is observed against the impersonality of much literary theory and the dangers of reducing reading to a science, but alternative models that stress the therapeutic, self-enhancing, or playful elements in reading are also exposed to critical analysis.<br>

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Abstract: In this paper some elements of the reading process of Luke 12:35-48 are analysed according to the theory of Wolfgang Iser. Two problems are stated in the introduction, namely the impossibility of accounting for the reading process exhaustively in one all-encompassing theory, and the difficulty of "applying" Iser's theory, which is proposed as a theory of the reading process and not a method for analysing the reading process of an actual text. After a short exposition of the philosophical background and the main elements of the theory, a description of some elements of the reading process of this particular text is given. The paper concludes with a short reflection on the viability of this theory for a practical reception analysis.<br>

Abstract: The persecution, flight and murder of European Jews in the first half of the twentieth century and the profound social and political transformations that decisively affected European cities in the final decade of the 20th century have radically altered urban 'Jewish landscapes'. New stakeholders and institutions emerged with their own networks, goals and interests, and have constructed, staged and marketed 'Jewish culture' anew. The resultant Jewish spaces are being constituted in an urban space located at the intersection of ethnic representation, collective memory, and drawing on an imagined material culture, which includes architectural, physical and digital spaces (e.g. synagogues, Jewish quarters). This Europe-wide process is closely related to the delicate politics of memory and to discourses on the authenticity of cities. This article analyses how the image of 'Jewishness' plays an increasingly important role in the marketing of historical authenticity that cities and their tourism affiliates are undertaking.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the myth of Russian dance which they espouse can be understood without placing their authors in the milieu they shared in Paris as Russian émigrés.<br>

Abstract: H. P. Lovecraft's texts deal with the cosmos providing words and mechanisms beyond words, such as analogy. Tracing the relationship between analogy and the poetic metaphor in the Lovecraftian text the paper turns to Paul Ricoeur's notion of the living metaphor as the embodiment of tension providing secondary referentiality. The essay argues that the ontological nature of analogy and metaphor supplies an indirect strategy to move towards the beyond, to transfer the unknown to the realm of the known. In this process, by referring to what is interstitial, void-like, and monstrous, this metaphorically active, poetic, and "ecstatic" Lovecraftian text becomes a "monster" in its own right: the indescribable and unnamable overflow into the world of representation, creating the monster-text.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores a phenomenon familiar to archivists: the seamless moment of time and space within the remembering process when communities become aware of and must confront the fragility of public memory and make decisions about the management and preservation of their information resources. This decision point has recently been called the documentary moment. The authors' exploration of this concept focuses on the theories, strategies, methodologies, and processes formerly employed and now emerging at Library and Archives Canada (LAC) to facilitate the disposition of government's information resources. They also examine the challenges presented by the digital age on the documentary moment and whether corresponding philosophical or methodological changes to current institutional strategies, including macro-appraisal, are required.<br>

Abstract: Thousands of child Holocaust survivors arrived in Montreal, Quebec, between 1947 and 1952, looking to remake their lives, rebuild their families, and recreate their communities. Integration was not seamless. As survivors struggled to carve spaces for themselves within the established Canadian Jewish community, their difficult wartime stories were neither easily received nor understood. When remembering this period, survivors tend to speak about employment, education, dating, integration into both the pre-war Jewish community and the larger society, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of their own social worlds within existing and new frameworks. Forged in a transitional and tumultuous period in Quebec's history, these social worlds, as this article demonstrates, are an important example of survivor agency. Although survivors recall the ways in which Canadian Jews helped them adjust to their new setting, by organizing a number of programs and clubs within various spaces—Jeanne Mance House, the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Public Library—they also speak about how they forged their own paths upon arriving in this postwar city. For instance, survivors created the New World Club, an informal and grassroots social organization where they could prioritize their own needs and begin to be understood as people, and not just survivors. Establishing the interconnections between these formal and informal social worlds, and specifically, how survivors navigated them, is central to understanding the process through which they were able to move beyond their traumatic pasts and start over. Nightmares and parties are parts of the same story, and here the focus is on the memories of young survivors who prioritized their social worlds. Des milliers d'enfants survivants de l'Holocauste sont arrivés à Montréal, au Québec, entre 1947 et 1952, cherchant à refaire leurs vies, reconstruire leurs familles et recréer leurs communautés. L'intégration n'était pas sans faille. Non seulement les survivants ont-ils du mal à se tailler une place au sein de la communauté juive canadienne existante, leurs pénibles récits de la guerre ne sont ni facilement reçus, ni facilement compris. Se rappelant cette période, les survivants ont tendance à parler de l'emploi, de l'éducation, de rencontres et d'intégration à la fois dans la communauté juive et la société d'avant-guerre et, plus encore, de la création de leurs propres univers sociaux dans de cadres établis ou récents. Créés dans une période transitoire et tumultueuse de l'histoire du Québec, ces mondes sociaux, comme le montre cet article, sont un exemple important de la volonté d'agir des survivants. Bien que les survivants rappellent comment les Juifs du Canada les ont aidés à s'adapter à leur nouveau contexte, en organisant un certain nombre déprogrammes et de clubs au sein de différents espaces - Jeanne Mance House, la Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association et la Jewish Public Library - ils racontent aussi comment ils ont forgé leur propre voies en arrivant dans cette ville d'aprèsguerre. Par exemple, les survivants ont créés le New World Club, un organisme social informel et populaire où ils pouvaient donner priorité à leurs propres besoins et commencer à être compris comme êtres humains et non seulement comme survivants. Démontrer les interconnexions entre ces mondes sociaux formels et informels et, plus particulièrement, comment les survivants y ont navigué, est essentiel à la compréhension du processus par lequel ils ont pu dépasser leurs expériences traumatiques et repartir à zéro. Cauchemars et fêtes sont deux versants d'une même histoire; l'accent ici est mis sur les souvenirs des jeunes survivants qui ont accordé la priorité à leurs mondes sociaux.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo analiza el conflicto fronterizo entre los gobiernos de Nicaragua y Costa Rica, el cual cobró mayor prominencia a partir de octubre de 2010. En el primer apartado se describen algunos antecedentes del conflicto, el cual ha sido recurrente a lo largo del período republicano. En segundo lugar, se analiza cómo este conflicto se articula con procesos políticos tanto en Nicaragua como en Costa Rica. En tercer lugar, se discute la necesidad de una agenda binacional "desde abajo" que permita trascender los llamados al nacionalismo y al patriotismo. Finalmente, se sistematizan algunas de las repercusiones más importantes de este conflicto. This article analyzes the border conflict between the governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica that gained greater prominence since October 2010. The first section provides some background to the conflict, which has been recurrent throughout the Republican period. Second, it is analyzed how the current conflict is articulated with political processes both in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In third place, it is discussed the need for a binational agenda "from below" able to overcome nationalists and patriotic calls. Finally, some of the main repercussions of this conflict are summarized.<br>

Abstract: The first-generation literature on policy design has made considerable contributions over the last 30 years to our understanding of the process, politics and implications of policy design and instrument choice. This literature, however, has generally treated institutions as a black box and has not developed a coherent set of frameworks, theories and models of how institutions matter to policy design. In this paper, I unpack the black box of institutions using transaction cost and mechanism design to show how regulations can be better designed in developing countries when institutions are weak, unaccountable, corrupted or not credible. Under these conditions, I show that efficient regulatory design has to minimize transaction costs, particularly agency problems, by having incentive compatible (self-enforcing) mechanisms. I conclude with a second-generation research agenda on regulatory design with implications for environmental, food and drug safety, healthcare and financial regulation in developing countries.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines key implications of praxis theory for applied anthropology. I am concerned with applied anthropology as a communicative and collaborative process and with a critical understanding of the anthropologist's role as consultant, practitioner, and analyst in processes of planned change. The use of praxis as a central analytic leitmotif places "practical" activity, informed by theory, at the center of applied research. The analysis is illustrated through a description of a multi-disciplinary, community-based health research and planning project in seven native communities in Ontario. I examine how practical knowledge and action constrains and transforms academic models of community based development.<br>

Abstract: Sacred music has always been a source of controversy throughout history since it is an integral part of the liturgy. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has reached a pinnacle of controversy as its realm of consumption expands globally and inter-denominationally. This study was inspired by the idea of Ricoeur's phenomenology of religion to examine the contemporary practice of liturgy and sacred music. This brings into discussion the historical controversy and cultural milieu of adopting popular culture into youth ministry. Korean case is important because Korea represents one of the strongest Christian populations in the world and at the same time challenges - a drop in the number of young members and a huge generational gap in its church congregations. In order to scrutinize the concrete process of youth culture in the Christian community, an empirical study of youth ministry in seven mega churches in Seoul in South Korean was conducted as a case study. Sakralna glazba oduvijek je tijekom povijesti bila izvor kontroverzi jer predstavlja integrálni dio liturgije, a povijest glazbe je iz nje izrasla. Suvremena kršèanska glazba dostigla je vrhunac kontroverzije kad se njezino potrošaèko podruèje proširilo globalno i medukonfesionalno. Ovaj je članak nastao na temelju Ricoeurove fenomenologije religije i nastoji ispitati suvremenu praksu u liturgiji i sakralnoj glazbi u svjetlu nasljeda povijesne kontroverze i kultúrne sredine u prihvaćanju populárne kultúre u mladenačkoj službi božjoj. Teologija glazbe, o kojoj su raspravljali u 16. stoljeèu Luther, Zwingli i Calvin, osobito je korisna za konzultiranje pri suvremenom prilagodavanju na populárnu kulturu u crkvi. Štoviše, humanizam usaden u liturgijsku reformaciju u razdoblju renesanse otvára filozofijsko pitanje čovjekova identiteta pred licem božanskoga, o èemu se raspravljalo tijekom moderne i postmoderne povijesti sve do danas. Kako bi se pažljivo ispitao konkrétni proces mladenačke kulture u kršćanskoj zajednici, provedeno je kao studija slučaja empirijsko istraživanje mladenačke službe božje u mega crkvama Južne Koreje. Korejsko je sluèaj važan jer Koreja predstavlja jednu od najjaèih kršèanskih populacija u svijetu, dok je s druge strane izložena izazovima kao što je primjerice pad broja mladih vjernika i ogromni generacijski jaz u njezinim crkvenim kongregacijama. Razmatranje mladenačkih kongregacija u sedam mega crkava u Seulu i tekstuaina analiza mladenačke službe božje s težištem na glazbu pruža informacije kóje povezuju filozofske rasprave o teologiji glazbe s pitanjem identiteta uključenog u hermeneutiku glazbene prakse u crkvama. Semiotièki prístup glazbenoj analizi prihvaèen je kao korisno sredstvo za povezivanje ovih empirijskih podataka s njihovim filozofijskim interpretacijama i za ispitivanje glazbene štruktúre i narativne štruktúre tekstova.<br>

Abstract: Masking is ubiquitous to the culture areas of the world and is a symbolic activity inextricably associated cross-culturally with cosmological drama and shamanic ritual. Our question is, "Masks work how?" In Part 1, we place masks within their physical, cultural and cosmological context so as to view the activity of masking as part of a wider symbolic process. Masks are seen to be transformations of face. In Part 2, the work of masking is realized as a transformation of experience, and is related to a general cycle of meaning in culture whereby cosmological beliefs give rise to direct experience, and experience verifies and vivifies cosmology. And in Part 3 the "how" of masking is explained using a biogenetic structural perspective which traces the possible transformations of brain that may occur within the wearer and audience and that may mediate a variety of mask-related experiences.<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Abstract: Clark (2011) recently reviewed literature on cognitive phenomena such as automaticity, non-conscious processing, and the "illusion of conscious will," concluding that most learning theories and instructional design models are informed by faulty assumptions regarding psychological functioning—namely, that most cognitive activity is conscious and volitional. Clark offered a number of recommendations for educational technology research and design based on the view that cognitive activity is mostly automated, unconscious, and determined by psychological variables outside of personal control. This response presents an alternative perspective and accompanying recommendations distinct from those offered by Clark. It primarily argues that evidence pertaining to automaticity and related phenomena may be reinterpreted to fit within a view of agency that emphasizes meaning, purpose, tacit knowledge, and narrative structure; and that this agentic view leads to a number of potentially fruitful avenues for theorizing and research in educational technology.<br>

Author(s): van DongenAbstract: In this article, I consider narratives told within a clinical setting. I argue that personnel in a day center for people with acquired brain damage are constantly involved in narrating about the disabled participants. The negotiation of who the participant is, and foremost will be, is in constant negotiation in regard to issues of hope. I further argue that hope is a meaning-making process and, as such, it has been defined as crucially connected to time. Hope has been said to enable a connection between the present and the future, because action taken in the present could bring about (positive) change in the future. However, I show that hope, in relation to narratives told about people with severe disabilities that are considered "incurable," must be understood within a realm of narrative foreclosure. Time seems to have lost the openness of its horizon for these people, and a narrative that tells of immediacy rather than chronology is created, resulting in hope being established within the present.<br>

Abstract: With positivist and technocratic notions still prevalent, Paul Healy's (1986) insightful effort to advance "interpretive policy inquiry" both underscores the limitations of conventional analysis and helps us to grasp the policy process in human terms. Yet the article falls short of a systematic presentation of the interpretive position and, in doing so, reveals the limitations of that approach: the need for an explicitly critical posture becomes clear. This point is made with particular attention to a pre-positivist figure, Machiavelli.<br>

Abstract: This article is an ethnographic exploration of the process through which citizens come to conceptualize their identities as political subjects in rapidly changing contexts. The focus of the article is the lifting, in 2003, of a ban on crossing between the northern and southern parts of the island of Cyprus, which had been instituted in 1974. The article examines how this new political change affected state rhetoric, and concentrates on the reactions of Greek-Cypriot citizens to this shift. These data are related to the wider discussion on the political theory of subjectivity and the concept of 'event', where, it is argued, anthropology has a significant contribution to make. / Le présent article est une exploration ethnographique des processus par lequel les citoyens en viennent à conceptualiser leurs identités comme sujets politiques dans des contextes de changements rapides. Il est centré sur l'abolition, en 2003, de l'interdiction de passage imposée en 1974 entre les parties Nord et Sud de L'île de Chypre. L'auteur examine la manière dont ce nouveau changement politique a affecté la rhétorique étatique, et se concentre sur les réactions des Chypriotes Grecs à cette évolution. Ces données sont replacées dans un cadre de discussion plus large sur la théorie politique de la subjectivité et le concept « d'événement », auquel l'anthropologie peut, selon l'auteur, apporter une contribution importante.<br>

Abstract: The frames that Lewis Carroll provided for the two Alice books have largely been ignored, when not simply dismissed, in recent Carroll criticism. Their conventional form and diction may account for this negative response, but examination of their provenance, their function within the structure of the two books, and the artistry evident in the individual frame components indicate how and why the frames are important to our understanding of Carroll's vision and purpose. The frame poems are designed to lead the reader into and away from the central dream tales through a process of lyric transformation and estrangement.<br>

Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The question of human rights in modern literary theory is closely connected to its concept of the "subject"; the paper outlines Barthes' concept of the centrality of the human subject and Derrida's concept of différance and its impact on his understanding of the concept of the subject. With Derrida's différance, which means both difference and deferral, it became impossible to talk about the concept of the "subject" in isolation from that of the "other," whether one is dealing with the national aspects of the subject or with its gender issues. The deconstruction of the concept of the "subject" brings into the fore the omitted, marginalised and neglected aspects pertinent to its composition and accentuates both the processes of difference and deferral inherent in it. The representation of the subject implies its difference from, and indeed suppression of, the other. It also shows how Derrida's concept of différance dealt a devastating blow to the various philosophical absolutes and social hierarchies which controlled our thinking. The paper then examines the implications of these new critical and philosophical concepts for two different "others": the similar other within the culture (women) and the different other, the stranger/outsider to the dominant Western culture. It demonstrates how modern literary theory helped women to liberate themselves from cultural oppression by deconstructing patriarchal binary thinking and its inherent bias against women and so consolidate their human rights. It limits itself in this domain to a discussion of the contribution of French feminist literary theory, particularly the work of Hélèn Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva. Their work shows how the literary, philosophical and critical canon perpetuated patriarchy and oppressed women. As for the different other, the paper refers to the work of Edward Said in his deconstruction of Orientalism and its discourse which subjects the other to the demands, needs and visions of the Western "self" and sacrifices in the process his identity and human rights. It also studies the work of the African American critic Henry Louis Gates and shows how his attempt to develop a literary theory based on, and deriving its conceptual framework from, the literature of African and Afro-American writers played a significant role in liberating the African American, undermining their biased representation in the culture, and upholding their human rights.<br>

Abstract: This article develops parallels between how individuals make sense of both lived experience and narrative performance in order to suggest how the process of following a narrative can give rise to affectively engaging states of mind or flows of thought that I term experiential meanings. Although potentiated through the artistry of performance, these meanings result from listeners' own interpretational processes and therefore become experiential resources available for use in their lives.<br>

Abstract: An approach to sociocultural analysis based on the ideas of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and others is used to provide the foundation for discussing narratives as "cultural tools." The production of official, state sponsored historical narratives is examined from this perspective, and it is argued that this production process may be shaped as much by dialogic encounters with other narratives as by archival information. These claims are harnessed to examine the production of post-Soviet Russian history textbooks, especially their presentation of the events surrounding the Russian Civil War of 1918-20.<br>

Abstract: Psychoanalytic anthropologists assume that folktales often reflect unconscious beliefs and attitudes of listeners, who can tolerate anxiety-provoking images and messages (perhaps wish fulfillments) because these have been projected at a safe distance into the characters in the story. Here I argue that our theory for how such a process occurs is inadequate in terms of contemporary psychoanalytic theory. We need to reexamine a number of questions for which we may have assumed we already have answers, including the nature of repression and how it is accomplished; who or what "hears" an unconscious idea that has been collectively repressed when it is expressed in a folktale; and whether Freud's structural model of id-ego-super-ego can provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding how unconscious ideas find their way into "expressive culture." I examine these questions in light of a folktale collected among Brazilian peasants. I conclude by questioning the central importance of the ego in repression, and propose a concept of a whole, or supraordinate, self to describe the actual agency in charge of repression.<br>

Abstract: Embodied memories of terror and violence create new meaning and reorder the world, but in doing so they encompass the inexplicable aspects of cultural processes that have allowed the world one lives in to become an unspeakable place, hostile and death-ridden. In this article, we examine the narratives of Cambodian refugees' experiences of the Khmer Rouge regime against the backdrop of an ethnographic study of older Cambodians' lives in an inner-city neighborhood. The stories from this study of 40 Cambodians between the ages of 50 and 79 illustrate the relationship between bodily distress and memory, and between personal history and collective experience. These narratives reveal how people strive to create continuity in their lives but under certain circumstances are unable to do so.<br>

Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Abstract: This study among the Maneo (Seram, Indonesia) focuses on the pragmatics of kinship knowledge. Through an extended investigation of a stranger's arrival, I untangle processes of recognition from those guiding the determination of relatedness. Recognition establishes the continuity of experience; as such, verity is a measure of the adequacy as opposed to accuracy of observation: a fact that contributes to the possibility of misrecognition. By contrast, relatedness is contingent upon the expression and suppression of different, sometimes contradictory historical ties. [kinship, knowledge, pragmatism, Maneo, Indonesia]<br>

Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Abstract: Kalapalo warrior biographies are concerned with dialogical processes of challenge, resistance, debate, and the negotiation of meaning - with the struggles that take place as people try to understand and experience anew. Although warriors were trained to aggressively defend their communities against enemies, these narratives describe how they attempted to refashion ideological forms connected with ethnic allegiance and moral community. The personalities of warriors, closely connected to the training they underwent in adolescence, are particularly important in this regard. While biographies are often understood as texts in which history is merely a context surrounding the progress of individuals, descriptions of personal development are shown here to constitute testimony about historical processes themselves, in this case the experiences of refugees fleeing from centers of European expansion in lowland South America.<br>

Abstract: Cultural cognition is the product of two different sorts of meaning: (a) the (objective) semiotic organization of cultural texts or models, and (b) the (subjective) processes of meaning construction through which cultural symbols become available to consciousness as "experience." This article proposes a way to bridge these two kinds of meaning by considering how cultural knowledge is grounded in sensory experience. Several cognitive processes (schematization, synesthesia, secondary intersubjectivity) are proposed for linking the objectively available schemata found in cultural practices and the processes of meaning construction by which individuals appropriate symbols to consciousness. The nature of the relation between public symbols and individual experience is discussed in relation to a number of current issues in post-structuralist culture theory.<br>

Abstract: This exploration of a Himalayan Sherpa ritual engages contemporary cultural anthropology debates concerning ethnographic essentialism, positivism, and so-called postmodernist approaches. The author notes a parallelism between Buddhist Sherpa ritual processes that call upon patrons to engage in mimesis with idealized images of themselves and ethnographic representations that call for Sherpas to become that which is desired by foreign others. A positivist reading of Sherpas thus leads us toward both a necessary reflexivity about the effects of our writing upon them and the adoption of a strategic essentialism aware of its karmic consequences.<br>

Abstract: An ethnographic study of a shelter in downtown Boston for people considered homeless and mentally ill documents the way in which the category of "experience," which many have taken to be universal and natural, is culturally and historically constituted. The residents of the shelter tend not to experience - defined here as an inwardly reflexive process that proceeds, coheres, and transforms through temporally integrative forms - but rather "struggle along" by way of an acutely tactile mode of perception that attends to episodic, temporally finite encounters. The fact that experience in the shelter is only a possibility, not a given, points to the need for a critical phenomenology that would help us to consider how this and other ways of being come about through specific social, cultural, political, and material forces.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses the work of psychoanalyst Melanie Klein to reopen the dialogue between anthropology and psychoanalysis. It argues that Kleinian concepts enhance an anthropology that seeks out both intersubjective and intrasubjective difference and disjuncture, and it demonstrates the uses of major Kleinian concepts for addressing classic anthropological problems, including gender classification and the analysis of persecution in witchcraft and sorcery systems. Applying Kleinian concepts to the analysis of cultural-historical process, it shows how splitting and denial may be central to the reproduction and hegemony of dominant cultural systems through time and addresses the question of how to theorize the relationship among dominant cultural systems, social differentiation, and individual subjectivities.<br>

Abstract: Graph-related practices are central to scientific endeavors, and graphing has long been hailed as one of the core "general process skills" that set scientists apart. We use two case studies from a large study among scientists to exemplify our findings that graphing is not a context-independent skill. Rather, scientists' competencies with respect to graph interpretation are highly contextual and are a function of their familiarity with the phenomena to which the graph pertains. If graphing practices are not general but are tied to embodied understandings and familiarity with representation practices, then there are implications for teaching graphing in school mathematics and science settings.<br>

Abstract: Studies of gender in the XIX century have privileged women writers. To approach these discourses there are several theories in the literary and feminist fields. However, this incidence of class, race, sex in gender relations and in the formation of feminine subjectivities is a theme which has been less studied. In this article I aim to relate these concepts with a focus on Black and Brown-skinned slaves, without abandoning the wider social interpretation. The written sources on this issue are fragmentary, in addition to distortions suffered by the interpretation of a third person: public prosecutor, liquidator of slaves, scribe and even historians and editors who participated in the organization of these written sources. The study presented deals with the processes of transformation of gender relations and feminine subjectivities with the unusual increase in the number of slaves in the nineteenth century Cuban.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the concepts of deliberative democracy and African palaver to conceptually (re) formulate and make intelligible the practices and performance of governance in Africa, with the aim of achieving a genuine normalization of societal behavior. Based on an analysis of the texts and a synthesis of texts analyzed, and drawing on the evidence at the present time, this is about establishing that the African palaver, often excluded from the cartography of official epistemology and relegated to the level of indigenous knowledge and practice, can define the conditions of possibility and feasibility for deliberative democracy, a political paradigm deemed dominant universal. However, the issue is that of cognitive decentering. How can one imagine that African conceptual categories, labeled as cheesy and reduced to the mere field of ethnological studies, can interact and correlate with modern recipes, with the idea of starting a process of governability, the realization of which is resilient democracy?<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/utopianstudies.25.1.0001">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/utopianstudies.25.1.0001</a>

Abstract: In this article, Ilya Kliger and Nasser Zakariya treat Lev Tolstoi’s conception of brotherhood from a narratological perspective. In the process, they trace the outlines of late Tolstoian narrative poetics, situating it within a variegated landscape of Tolstoi’s own more properly “realist” literary practice, and offering broader suggestions on the workings of narrative in its capacity to model social relations and ethical action. A narratological focus here allows them to elucidate how stories take part in contemporary understandings of social influence, human connectedness, and alienation—not only on the level of themes but also, and more deeply, on the level of the narrative organization of events. Their main focus is on one of Tolstoi’s late novellas “The Forged Coupon” and his last novel
         Resurrection.<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>

Abstract: Examining Agamben's reception of Hannah Arendt, and especially
         The Human Condition, in his theorization of biopolitics, this essay argues thatHomo Sacer I, by identifying Arendt with a quasi-Straussian “political philosophy,” fails to acknowledge the complexity of her conception of history. Far from simply affirming the normative force of classical political categories, Arendt regards these as emerging from a living power of distinction that thinking, by showing the historical process that brings about the effacement of these distinctions, seeks to bring into view. Nevertheless, Arendt's conception of history is not without contradiction: while arguing that metaphysics went astray by subordinating praxis to poiesis, her very account of history suggests that this subordination is inevitable, since only a “poetic,” indeed violent, act of making a distinction can distinguish praxis from poiesis. Precisely this problem lies at the center of Agamben's early engagement with Arendt inThe Man without Content.<br>
