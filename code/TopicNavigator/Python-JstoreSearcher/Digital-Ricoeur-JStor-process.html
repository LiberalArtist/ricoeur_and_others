  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Abstract: In a press conference two days after his election to a second term, President Bush assessed the import of his victory: “I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it.” President Bush interpreted the election results as a clear expression of public opinion. Through their votes, citizens indicated their support for his policy agenda: “After hundreds of speeches and three debates and interviews and the whole process, where you keep basically saying the same thing over and over again, that—when you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: One rewrites in order to improve a text. Sometimes the result is thought to be the better expression of an original meaning; at other times, it extends the idea in a new direction. In any case, textual revision is a process characterized by imperfection, change, negotiation, and fallibility. Traditionally, realism has seemed to be above this process: One identifies the relations of power or suffers the consequences. This attitude is reflected in the standard invocation of the classics of realism, which are seen as equivalent statements of a core doctrine of universal truths. From Thucydides to Machiavelli to Morgenthau, there<br>

  Book Title: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity-Trajectories of Israeli & Palestinian Symbol Use<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frank David A.<br>
  Abstract: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity: Trajectories of Israeli and Palestinian Symbol Useargues that rhetoric, ideology, and myth have played key roles in influencing the development of the 100-year conflict between first the Zionist settlers and the current Israeli people and the Palestinian residents in what is now Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is usually treated as an issue of land and water. While these elements are the core of the conflict, they are heavily influenced by the symbols used by both peoples to describe, understand, and persuade each other. The authors argue that symbolic practices deeply influenced the Oslo Accords, and that the breakthrough in the peace process that led to Oslo could not have occurred without a breakthrough in communication styles.Rowland and Frank develop four crucial ideas on social development: the roles of rhetoric, ideology, and myth; the influence of symbolic factors; specific symbolic factors that played a key role in peace negotiations; and the identification and value of criteria for evaluating symbolic practices in any society.<br>

  Abstract: The slightly more than five-year period from Menachem Begin’s election as prime minister of Israel in 1977 through the war in Lebanon represents one of the most crucial periods in symbolic development in the history of Israel. This period was dominated by conflicting aspects of the Revisionist symbol system. On the one hand, Begin led Israel first to the Camp David Accords and then to a peace treaty with Egypt. In the development of the peace process, Begin’s rhetoric reflected the underlying myth of Holocaust and Redemption, including a strong commitment to maintaining Israeli control over Eretz Israel, but also<br>

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Abstract: While they were held in detention facilities or treatment centers, most teenagers expressed an inflated sense of agency. Relying on the cultural narrative of the “American Dream,” they believed in their ability to desist from crime, even if the odds were stacked against them. Criminologists often overlook the role agency plays in the desistance process. Structural conditions can be measured and quantified reliably. Operationalizing agency is more difficult. Direct observations of criminal acts are ethically dubious. Even if researchers were able to witness a crime in the making, it would be impossible to generalize from isolated instances.

  Abstract: In this chapter we examine the problem of subjectivity as a transformation of lived experience in the wake of civil warfare and formation of the postcolonial nation-state. The specific terms of subjective alteration—collectively imprinted as a clash of political ethos¹ and personally imprinted as a shattering of identity and sentiment—are considered in relation to a culturally produced anguish in the aftermath of a conflict. Our ethnographic illustration of this process is the well-known case of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.² Prior to this political formation in 1975, multiparty warfare was waged throughout a fractured nation, as anticommunist armies<br>

  Book Title: Carnal Thoughts-Embodiment and Moving Image Culture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Sobchack Vivian<br>
  Abstract: In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,
      Carnal Thoughtsshows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.Carnal Thoughtsprovides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.<br>

  Abstract: Scholars of Hindutva have argued that in the context of communal violence in India a heightened sense of vulnerability among members of the Hindu middle and lower middle class is integral to the legitimization of violence, where a “majority” feels threatened by a “minority” (Jaffrelot 1996; Hansen 1999; Nussbaum 2007).

Though it is yet too early to speak of a genre of modern history, the development of new linguistic resources, in fact an entire semantic field, was the crucial and final element that brought the historicization process to a mature point.

Any traditional ambience that becomes a cosmos does so because it has been structured into a field for the perception of metonymies, has been organized, we might say, by the metonymizing process. Modernization (or disenchantment) is then the transformation of metonymies into metaphors; to modernize is to de-metonymize, to metaphorize.

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Author(s): Lee Kyoo<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the first four images of the Other mobilized in Descartes' Meditations--namely, the blind, the mad, the dreamy, and the bad--Reading Descartes Otherwise casts light on what have heretofore been the phenomenological shadows of "Cartesian rationality." In doing so, it discovers dynamic signs of spectral alterity lodged both at the core and on the edges of modern Cartesian subjectivity. Calling for a Copernican reorientation of the very notion "Cartesianism," the book's series of close, creatively critical readings of Descartes' signature images brings the dramatic forces, moments, and scenes of the cogito into our own contemporary moment. The author patiently unravels the knotted skeins of ambiguity that have been spun within philosophical modernity out of such cliches as "Descartes, the abstract modern subject" and "Descartes, the father of modern philosophy"--a figure who is at once everywhere and nowhere. In the process, she revitalizes and reframes the legacy of Cartesian modernity, in a way more mindful of its proto-phenomenological traces.<br>

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamenta~<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed.

  Abstract: The book begins with a methodological chapter that sets out the assumptions and procedures of the approach. This is followed by analyses of Poe's major works, exploring such special problems as Poe's treatment of the material world, including technology; the interrelation of body and consciousness; poetic voice; attitudes toward women; and the will to affirmation, plenitude, and unity. The center of interest is neither Poe's biography nor environment but always the meaning of Poe's words. Because these works are shaped by a single imagination and because they are experienced in time, as a process, each work has its own "way of going." The aim of the interpretation is to find this way and go along with it; to live each work dynamically, as it "happens," while tracing its interaction with other works.<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash again~<br>

I wrote this book because I felt a similar fatigue with the rhetoric of forgiveness, closure, and reconciliation, and I wanted to challenge a certain cluster of unquestioned assumptions and implied inferences. This book offers examples from various contexts, but the rhetoric and logic against which it objects are part of a global<br>

  Abstract: The terms “globalization” and “imperialism” signify two features of contemporary world politics that are regarded as antagonistic to each other. The former stands for a seemingly autonomous process of globe shrinking or stretching (depending on how you look at it), whereas the latter indicates a self-conscious extraction and movement of profit from some places to others through political domination and coercion more than economic rationality. If advocates of the first tend to have a postmodern, depoliticized view of the world, those of the latter tend to have a profoundly modernist geopolitical view in which dominant states (above all, the United<br>

  Abstract: The first chapter in this part is Ann Margaret Sharp’s “Discovering Yourself a Person.” Here she examines Chapter One of Harry Stottlemeier’s Discovery. In it, Sharp finds that because the first chapter relies heavily on the analysis of concepts like reasoning, reflecting, falsifying, inquiring, and so on, it is an appropriate place for the discovery (or invention, it might be added) of who and what we are. As one watches the characters in Harry begin the process of inquiry and as one watches them stumble toward the formation ofa community, one finds them formulating individual ways or styles of thinking.<br>

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

Yet, if we leave aside the important distinction that exists between the reverent contrition of Augustine and the self-aggrandizement associated with, say, contemporary “hooli-lit” (Fischer 2006), it is clear that, as long as society has recognized the concept of crime, a shadow process of making sense<br>

  Abstract: This article surveys Bonhoeffer’s early education in biblical studies, with a focus on his different encounters with Adolf Schlatter and Karl Barth. I propose that Bonhoeffer’s understanding of the tools of the historical-critical method in relation to a theologically focussed form of biblical interpretation was formed in this initial period, and that the relationship between history and revelation that he landed upon was not antithetical but complementary. Historical criticism was the servant of interpreting the Bible as revealed Scripture, but it was nevertheless an essential aspect of the interpretative process.

It is easy to make archaeological, geographical, and historical comments or to note critical and linguistic issues. It is quite another question to lay bare one’s conviction as to a text’s meaning.

In retrospect, the relationship can appear inevitable, even foreordained. My choice of field sites had more to do with day care than serendipity.<br>

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization.

Or perhaps ‘reservations’ is too strong a term. My unease is not about what cultural studies does, and does well, but about the areas it appears to leave out.

  Abstract: The events of 28 July 2005 alter our perspective. If we are to believe the statements of intent, and all concerned pass this high test of character, the announcement by the Irish Republican Army that it will decommission its arms marks an end of the Troubles and, albeit less significantly, a defining moment in the Irish culture wars of the last 40 years. Perhaps this sanguine vision is deceptive and the protracted peace process will persist in being characterised by sporadic slides into crisis. If so, then this vision of an end to the culture wars will also deceive; but<br>

  Author(s) Liep John<br>
  Abstract: How does one locate ‘cultural creativity’? Where does one search? Just trying to define the phrase – so one has a clear sense of what one is after – is enough to muddle the process. Regarding culture, for example, Hatch notes: ‘Even though the term has been discussed in countless books and articles, there is still a large degree of uncertainty in its use – anthropologists employ the notion in fundamentally different ways’ (1973:1). Likewise, ambiguity surrounds creativity. My dictionary equates creativity with inventiveness, bringing something new into being, originating.

  Book Title: Practicing the City: Early Modern London on Stage-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Levine Nina<br>
  Abstract: In late-sixteenth-century London, the commercial theaters undertook a novel experiment, fueling a fashion for plays that trafficked in the contemporary urban scene. But beyond the stage's representing the everyday activities of the expanding metropolis, its unprecedented urban turn introduced a new dimension into theatrical experience, opening up a reflexive space within which an increasingly diverse population might begin to "practice" the city. In this, the London stage began to operate as a medium as well as a model for urban understanding. Practicing the City traces a range of local engagements, onstage and off, in which the city's population came to practice new forms of urban sociability and belonging. With this practice, Levine suggests, city residents became more self-conscious about their place within the expanding metropolis and, in the process, began to experiment in new forms of collective association. Reading an array of materials, from Shakespeare and Middleton to plague bills and French-language manuals, Levine explores urban practices that push against the exclusions of civic tradition and look instead to the more fluid relations playing out in the disruptive encounters of urban plurality.<br>

                  métissage, as the process and outcome of racial mixing, was most particularly associated with women characters, and largely characterized by sexual permissiveness and biological degeneration. The earliest written literature in New Caledonia was, for the most part, produced by Metropolitan French people passing through. Louise Michel, considered in Chapters 1 and 2, spent eight years in the country’s penitentiary system, leaving New Caledonia after the general amnesty to rejoin her ailing mother in France. Jacques and Marie Nervat came to the colony a decade later, where they lived from 1898 to 1902.<br>

  Book Title: Leaving the North-Migration and Memory, Northern Ireland 1921–2011<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Trew Johanne Devlin<br>
  Abstract: Leaving the North is the first book that provides a comprehensive survey of Northern Ireland migration since 1921. Based largely on the personal memories of emigrants who left Northern Ireland from the 1920s to the 2000s, approximately half of whom eventually returned, the book traces their multigenerational experiences of leaving Northern Ireland and adapting to life abroad, with some later returning to a society still mired in conflict. Contextualised by a review of the statistical and policy record, the emigrants’ stories reveal that contrary to its well-worn image as an inward-looking place – 'such narrow ground' – Northern Ireland has a rather dynamic migration history, demonstrating that its people have long been looking outward as well as inward, well connected with the wider world. But how many departed and where did they go? And what of the Northern Ireland Diaspora? How has the view of the ‘troubled’ homeland from abroad, especially among expatriates, contributed to progress along the road to peace? In addressing these questions, the book treats the relationship between migration, sectarianism and conflict, immigration and racism, repatriation and the Peace Process, with particular attention to the experience of Northern Ireland migrants in the two principal receiving societies – Britain and Canada. With the emigration of young people once again on the increase due to the economic downturn, it is perhaps timely to learn from the experiences of the people who have been ‘leaving the North’ over many decades; not only to acknowledge their departure but in the hope that we might better understand the challenges and opportunities that migration and Diaspora can present.<br>

  Book Title: Horror and Its Aftermath-Reconsidering Theology and Human Experience<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Stamper Sally<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology often brings psychology to bear on the contingent nature of human existence in relationship to God. In this volume, Sally Stamper articulates one modern trajectory of theological recourse to psychology (comprising Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, and Tillich) as the ground on which she brings clinical psychoanalytic theory and early childhood studies into conversation with fundamental questions about the relationship of God to human suffering and its remediation. She develops her argument from the assertions that human experience evolves within an awareness of human vulnerability to profound suffering and that insight into consequent human anxiety is a powerful resource for soteriology, eschatology, and theological anthropology. Stamper narrates this “normative anxiety" by integrating object relations theories of early childhood development and critical readings of literary texts for young children. She gestures toward a new eschatological vision that poses the radical otherness of a transcendent God as key to divine remediation of human suffering, in the process building on Marilyn McCord Adams’s soteriological response to human horror-participation and on Jonathan Lear’s assertion of radical hope in response to catastrophic collapse of cultural resources for making meaning.<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Abstract: Free individuality, human capacities, and inner state of mind most directly involve the personal space of the self but also in a broader sense the distinction and interaction between the individual domain and the public sphere. As interrelated aspects of the social world, the individual domain and its connection to the public sphere also sets the concrete background for the historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things. As the actual mode of being, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is never separable from diverse social resources, and the acquisition, possession, and distribution of resources involves the issue of social justice.<br>

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

In the process of structuring social experience, narrative necessarily reinvents itself in each epoch, offering an historically specific experience.

  Book Title: Early Cinema and the "National"-  Publisher: John Libbey Publishing<br>
  Author(s): King Rob<br>
  Abstract: While many studies have been written on national cinemas, Early Cinema and the "National" is the first anthology to focus on the concept of national film culture from a wide methodological spectrum of interests, including not only visual and narrative forms, but also international geopolitics, exhibition and marketing practices, and pressing linkages to national imageries. The essays in this richly illustrated, landmark anthology are devoted to reconsidering the nation as a framing category for writing cinema history. Many of the 34 contributors show that concepts of a national identity played a role in establishing the parameters of cinema's early development, from technological change to discourses of stardom, from emerging genres to intertitling practices. Yet, as others attest, national meanings could often become knotty in other contexts, when concepts of nationhood were contested in relation to colonial/imperial histories and regional configurations. Early Cinema and the "National" takes stock of a formative moment in cinema history, tracing the beginnings of the process whereby nations learned to imagine themselves through moving images.<br>

This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

  Abstract: Traditionally, social studies of factories have focused on issues of discrimination, oppression, and resistance. The earliest studies in industrial anthropology, the Hawthorne research projects, examined the ways in which workers controlled the production process against the interests of management (Baba 1986). More recently, the work of Roberts et al.,
                  Language and Discrimination(1992) focused on ways in which English managers unconsciously exclude their non-English workers through the use of language and communication, and Westwood’s (1984)All Day, Every Dayanalyses how women from a variety of ethnic origins gain empowerment against their male relatives and bosses through subversive practices.

  Abstract: White supremacy holds that the interests of people of European descent are superior to those of people who believe, act, or look differently than” normal.” It perpetuates the stratification of class, race, religion, sexual orientation, and gender. It embraces Nazism, fascism, and violence. Its open manifestations are extremist hate groups; its results are political and social systems based not on the democratic ideals of majority rule, tolerance, diversity, equality, and justice, but on “white is right.” White supremacists are America’s deepest nightmare because they attack not only individuals and groups, but the legitimacy of our democratic process itself.<br>

  Abstract: This essay is concerned with “religion and ecology,” or religious environmentalism. It analyzes how religious traditions are used to understand and interact with the environment and environmental issues, suggesting ways of relating to these that are different from and possibly less destructive and ecologically harmful than those of the modern secular worldview. It argues that religious traditions may thereby be gaining new private and public relevance, while perhaps also being changed in the process, becoming more environmentally friendly and ecumenical.

  Author(s) McKeane John<br>
  Abstract: Whereas Part III deals with how the self-deconstruction of monotheism and Christianity entails a poetic mode of language and sense, this part examines how this self-deconstructive moment plays out in art and the image. Nancy suggests that art does not merely illustrate religion. Instead, the two are involved in the same self-deconstructive movement or in a process of a mutual dis-enclosure. Whereas art provides the sensible articulation of the internal destabilization of the religious mode, the unstable core in religion—an origin in its displacement—forms an integral part of the condition of art.<br>

  Abstract: To describe biblical performance criticism, I start by explaining how human beings communicate. Performance criticism analyzes and practices certain kinds of communication, specifically repeated behaviors for an audience. Inquiry, imagination, and intervention are three aspects of a performance and its analysis. Biblical performance criticism is the analysis and practice of performances of biblical traditions. The basic method of biblical performance criticism is to prepare, internalize, and perform a biblical text.

  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: In
      Freud's
            Mosesa distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

  Author(s): O’Connor Terry<br>
  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: The powers’ dynamic autonomization never escapes the grip of providence. The fallen powers are created powers. As neither wholly good, nor wholly evil, the shape of the powers must be discerned. Yoder’s theological method privileges a form of discernment rooted in the practical encounter between specific Christian communities and specific powers. Discernment is ultimately a function of mission. Theologians’ contribution to this mission is limited, according to Yoder, yet indispensable for the discernment process. The theologian’s gifts of linguistic analysis and scriptural and historical memory are useful because they facilitate a comparison of the powers with the way of Jesus.<br>

Historically, how the experiences are named determined the types of treatment that were deemed to be appropriate.

  Book Title: Dealing with Dictators-The United States, Hungary, and East Central Europe, 1942-1989<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): VINCZ JASON<br>
  Abstract: Dealing with Dictators explores America's Cold War efforts to make the dictatorships of Eastern Europe less tyrannical and more responsive to the country's international interests. During this period, US policies were a mix of economic and psychological warfare, subversion, cultural and economic penetration, and coercive diplomacy. Through careful examination of American and Hungarian sources, László Borhi assesses why some policies toward Hungary achieved their goals while others were not successful. When George H. W. Bush exclaimed to Mikhail Gorbachev on the day the Soviet Union collapsed, "Together we liberated Eastern Europe and unified Germany," he was hardly doing justice to the complicated history of the era. The story of the process by which the transition from Soviet satellite to independent state occurred in Hungary sheds light on the dynamics of systemic change in international politics at the end of the Cold War.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. Initially, we looked at several different modes of speech, the univocal, equivocal, analogical, and metaphorical, looking at their approach to speaking of a transcendent being. The univocal approach treated language for God and for humans as having the same sense. This immediately runs into problems, however, as God is a non-created Being and His attributes are neither contingent nor finite in nature. Process theologians attempt to<br>

  Abstract: In his categorial semiotics and phenomenology, Charles Sanders Peirce arrives at a fundamental triadic structure that, he claims, shapes all possible experience and reality alike. The subject—seen as the “interpretant” in a triadic semiotic process—becomes an instance in the self-interpretation of the universe of signs. Thus, perception of reality and reality itself coincide. This can be experienced in what Peirce calls the category of “Firstness.” Following Peirce, the contemplation of reality in the immediate experience of its quality (Firstness) is a phenomenological task. In Peirce’s “humble argument” for the reality of God, the experience of Firstness can account<br>

  Book Title: The Helping Relationship-Healing and Change in Community Context<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rovers Martin<br>
  Abstract: The increased use of and emphasis on managed care, manualized treatment protocols, evidence-based treatments and quick treatments have marginalized the role of the helping relationship in the helping professions. This shift has sparked a debate within the helping professions over whether the helping relationship or technique is primarily responsible for healing and change.
      The Helping Relationshipweighs in on this debate, arguing that healing and change always take place within the context of relationships and that the relationship is more important than the technique. While recognizing the value of techniques, the authors valorize the helping relationship, considering it in unconventional contexts, such as formal education, supervision, and faith communities to show its flexibility and efficacy. This alternative approach adds a new perspective on the helping relationship debate, shedding new light on the roles of relationship and technique in the healing process.<br>

  Abstract: Today’s prevalent political theories describe the task of social institutions, such as the market and the political process, as aggregating the preferences of society’s members. (See, for instance, Chapter 2.) Social institutions themselves, however, influence the preferences that they are then supposed to aggregate.¹ It is difficult to understand how the aggregation can coherently take place when preferences are not exogenous to the institutions.<br>

Through their different political perspectives, the two quotations raise questions about, first, indigenous accounts of what Zygmunt Bauman calls the “human” and “social consequences of the globalizing process” (1), and, second, the theoretical and pedagogical value of diverse concepts and metaphors of cultural hybridity in an indigenous context. But they are also a reminder that “epigraph[s],” in Jacques Derrida’s words, “will never make a beginning” but comprise an indefinite network of texts (

The answer may lie in the British assertion of cultural purity that sought to create the colonial human being and Acadia itself, and that, paradoxically, constituted the foundation of calls for the civilization of aboriginal peoples. The claim to be firmly British was clearly problematic. These peoples’ European identity had been transformed in the process of becoming colonials.

  Book Title: Comparing Faithfully-Insights for Systematic Theological Reflection<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: Every generation of theologians must respond to its context by rearticulating the central tenets of the faith. Interreligious comparison has been integral to this process from the start of the Christian tradition and is especially salient today. The emerging field of comparative theology, in which close study of another religious tradition yields new questions and categories for theological reflection in the scholar's home tradition, embodies the ecumenical spirit of this moment. This discipline has the potential to enrich systematic theology and, by extension, theological education, at its foundations. This resource for pastors and theology students reconsiders five central doctrines of the Christian faith in light of focused interreligious investigations. The dialogical format of the book builds conversation about the doctrine of God, theodicy, humanity, Christology, and soteriology. Its comparative essays span examples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Jain, and Confucian traditions, indigenous Aztec theology, and contemporary "spiritual but not religious" thought, to offer exciting new perspectives on Christian doctrine. The essays in this volume demonstrate that engagement with religious diversity need not be an afterthought in the study of Christian systematic theology; rather, it can be a way into systematic theological thinking. Each section invites students to test theological categories, to consider Christian doctrine in relation to specific comparisons, and to take up comparative study in their own contexts.<br>

Together they express the centrality and sui generis nature—in short, the uniqueness—of Jesus for Christian faith.

  Book Title: Ethos and Narrative Interpretation-The Negotiation of Values in Fiction<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Herman David<br>
  Abstract: Ethos and Narrative Interpretationexamines the fruitfulness of the concept of ethos for the theory and analysis of literary narrative. The notion of ethos refers to the broadly persuasive effects of the image one may have of a speaker's psychology, world view, and emotional or ethical stance. How and why do readers attribute an ethos (of, for example, sincerity, reliability, authority, or irony) to literary characters, narrators, and even to authors? Are there particular conditions under which it is more appropriate for interpreters to attribute an ethos to authors, rather than to narrators? In the answer Liesbeth Korthals Altes proposes to such questions, ethos attributions are deeply implicated in the process of interpreting and evaluating narrative texts.<br>

  Book Title: Useful Fictions-Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): AUSTIN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on evolutionary biology, anthropology, narrative theory, cognitive psychology, game theory, and evolutionary aesthetics, Austin develops the concept of a "useful fiction," a simple narrative that serves an adaptive function unrelated to its factual one. In his work we see how these useful fictions play a key role in neutralizing the overwhelming anxiety that humans can experience as their minds gather and process information. Rudimentary narratives constructed for this purpose, Austin suggests, provided a cognitive scaffold that might have become the basis for our well-documented love of fictional stories. Written in clear, jargon-free prose and employing abundant literary examples-from the Bible to
      One Thousand and One Arabian NightsandDon QuixotetoNo Exit-Austin's work offers a new way of understanding the relationship between fiction and evolutionary processes-and, perhaps, the very origins of literature.<br>

  Book Title: Public Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: In early imperial China, the dead were remembered by stereotyping them, by relating them to the existing public memory and not by vaunting what made each person individually distinct and extraordinary in his or her lifetime. Their posthumous names were chosen from a limited predetermined pool; their descriptors were derived from set phrases in the classical tradition; and their identities were explicitly categorized as being like this cultural hero or that sage official in antiquity. In other words, postmortem remembrance was a process of pouring new ancestors into prefabricated molds or stamping them with rigid cookie cutters. Public Memory in Early China is an examination of this pouring and stamping process. After surveying ways in which learning in the early imperial period relied upon memorization and recitation, K. E. Brashier treats three definitive parameters of identity—name, age, and kinship—as ways of negotiating a person’s relative position within the collective consciousness. He then examines both the tangible and intangible media responsible for keeping that defined identity welded into the infrastructure of Han public memory.<br>

  Book Title: Forms of Life-Character and Moral Imagination in the Novel<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PRICE MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

  Abstract: Narratives need time to tell their stories. In fact, without time, a narrative is not a narrative. This is because in order to tell a story, the storyteller must relay to the hearer or reader at least one process or event. For example, “Everett” is not a narrative. “Everett walks” is not much of a narrative, though the present tense “walks” in English implies a motion that occurs in time. A better narrative would be, “Everett drove the car to the store, picked up groceries, and came home.” This is the beginning of a “real” narrative because it entails multiple<br>

  Book Title: Assia Djebar-Out of Algeria<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: For more than fifty years, Assia Djebar, former Silver Chair of French at New York University and winner of the Neustadt Prize for Contribution to World Literature, used the tools of poetry, fiction, drama and film to vividly portray the world of Muslim women in all its complexity. In the process, she became one of the most important figures in North African literature. In
      Assia Djebar, Jane Hiddleston traces Djebar's development as a writer against the backdrop of North Africa's tumultuous history. Whereas Djebar's early writings were largely an attempt to delineate clearly the experience of being a woman, an intellectual, and an Algerian embedded in that often violent history, she had in her more recent work evinced a growing sense that the influence of French culture on Algerian letters may make such a project impossible. The first book-length study of this significant writer,Assia Djebarwill be of tremendous interest to anyone studying post-colonial literature, women's studies or Francophone culture in general.<br>

During this process, the simplifying notions are modified and, eventually, they may disappear. For example, economics assumes scarcity, and hence the need to rationalize and economize; politics presupposes the existence of struggles to maximize power; and sociology insists upon the necessity of social solidarity. Taking our cue from the etymology of socius , sociology is the science of companionship or friendship. For social science as a whole, civil society is the space in which these somewhat<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

It is distinct from the process of “secularization” whereby the state, professions such as medicine and law, and academic fields such as archeology gradually take over areas of human life once governed by religion and the church.

This indicates the diminishing ascendancy of Catholicism over our societies, an ‘exculturation’ that testifies to a further step in the secularization process.¹ Indeed, in the last quarter of the 20 th and<br>

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

  Abstract: If, as Benedict Anderson has suggested, the idea of a nation is in large measure imagined retrospectively, the Soviet Union offers an interesting counterpoint—that of a nation imagined prospectively.¹ The Soviet Union literally had to be invented. As is well known, cinema was expected to play a crucial role in this process. Surely it was for such a purpose that Lenin anointed cinema the premier socialist artform. Many Soviet films of the twenties were devoted to consolidating a tradition for the new nation, commemorating its revolutionary founding in historical spectacles, like V. I. Pudovkin’s

  Abstract: In a book that ranges from St. Augustine to alcoholism, Thomas Aquinas to Thomas Mann, Shakespeare to the Holocaust, Eagleton investigates the frightful plight of those doomed souls who apparently destroy for no reason. In the process, he poses a set of intriguing questions. Is evil really a kind of nothingness? Why should it appear so glamorous and seductive? Why does goodness seem so boring? Is it really possible for human beings to delight in destruction for no reason at all?<br>

  Abstract: The same process of modernization and industrialization that successfully transformed the entire world by materializing the project of the Enlightenment has always co-existed with a tradition of critique of civilization that aims to disclose a darker reality beneath the surface of this success story.

  Abstract: Karl Jaspers’ theory of delusion (

Based on Jaspers’ casuistic observations of nihilistic delusion and nihilistic worldview, as presented in 1919, we first analyze the relationship between delusion and worldview – a relationship analogous to that between “psychotic process” and “development of personality” in his concept of psychopathology. We then scrutinize this categorical distinction and its underlying methodical assumptions and consider possible links between delusion and worldview. Our conclusion is that,<br>

Given how utterly mega-novel text overwhelms our limited working memory and how often it dissolves its most important text into a large amount of cruft, I have argued that we must hone our ability to modulate attention to an extremely fine degree, filtering the latter so as to better perceive the former.

A historical and comparative overview of related terms – exile, émigré, expatriation, travel, emigration/immigration, diaspora, and nomadism – helps us understand displacement as a dynamic migrant experience that may range from being totally negative to very positive. Exiles are reconciled to their present predicament and have nostalgic feelings for the past; émigrés are actively involved in the contemporary literary process in the homeland and seek to return; emigrants/immigrants integrate and adapt themselves<br>

For them, building a theory of it means proposing an alternative system of information-processing, paratactic to the everyday rational system. They revert to the lower orders of the soul by a process of elimination. Since divination seems not to have a place in the normal modes of thinking, they propose that some other form of insight dwells in the soul’s other parts, situated closely to our creaturely selves.

  Author(s): White Harrison C.<br>
  Abstract: In this completely revised edition of one of the foundational texts of network sociology, Harrison White refines and enlarges his groundbreaking theory of how social structure and culture emerge from the chaos and uncertainty of social life. Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro,
      Identity and Controlpresents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.<br>

  Author(s) DECKERT JENNIFER CHAPPELL<br>
  Abstract: Motherhood is an identity common to women in all societies, but the expression of it varies greatly both within and across social groups. Mothering emerges from the intersection of a woman’s personality, her life experiences, and choices available to her, and is embedded in gender role expectations shaped by religion, culture, and historical context. Every woman constructs her own expression of motherhood through a process of accepting and resisting role expectations. The process of establishing individual motherhood priorities may be covert or overt—likely influenced by the consequences of the choices. Thus the social construction of motherhood is dynamic and<br>

  Abstract: Noted anthropologist clifford geertz defines culture as “the ensemble of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves” (448). In keeping with this theory, Fred Inglis suggests that identity is formed through a process whereby we observe and “inhabit the narratives of how to live” available within a given culture (“Culture and Sentiment” 2). Such narratives generally reflect the dominant discourse and accepted range of meanings in relation to socially defined roles. In terms of the negotiated meaning of motherhood, however, there is a growing tension between competing narratives and representations that highlight the juxtaposition between culturally constructed fantasies of maternal perfection<br>

  Abstract: How do we sustain agency and identity amidst the frailty of advanced old age? What role does care play in this process? Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by age and infirmity. It begins with a theoretical examination of the fourth age, interrogating notions of agency, identity and personhood, as well as the impact of frailty, abjection and ‘othering’. It then applies this analysis to issues of care. Exploring our collective hopes and fears concerning old age and the ends of people’s lives, this is essential reading on one of the biggest social issues of our time.Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by ageing, and the associated problems of mental and physical frailty in later life.<br>

In the 17th century, a territorial administration was created to implement the rational organisation of space through centralised infrastructure as the cornerstone of the new-born nation state and, from the late 18th century, a vector for republican values (Foucault, 1975). In the late 20th century, despite a shift towards decentralisation that saw private actors taking a central role in urban planning, things remained fundamentally unchanged. By defining and implementing urban laws, including the process for the declaration of public utility, national and local government remain responsible for orchestrating spatial planning.¹ This<br>

To realise this goal, they endeavour to prevent the decay – or further decay – of their artefacts by, first, treating these objects with extreme caution and trying, as much as possible, to limit the destructive impact of environmental factors (Pomian, 1988: 14); and, second, cleaning and restoring them, repairing the damage that inevitably accrues over time.

  Abstract: New thinking in queer temporalities and affects outside of the (temporally, affectively charged) field of religion constitutes a challenge and invitation to stretch queer thinking in theology yet again, and further. Although feminist, womanist, process, and other theorists in religion and theology have been working around the fuzzy borders and stubborn impasses that fleshy experiences—bodies and histories of bodies—present, queerly inflected affect theory expands these moves into a complex materialism.¹ Affect theory’s approach to embodiment in terms of the deeply constitutive dynamics of temporality, proximity, touch, and even elemental gravitation provides a conceptual framework that helpfully limits any<br>

  An Overview from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sbd">Piaget's Theory of Knowledge</a><br>
  Abstract: We know things, Piaget claims, because we construct epistemic structures, which function as necessary conditions for knowledge. In this process our epistemic structures become progressively more adequate. This constructivism, whatever conceptual flaws it may have, lies at the heart of Piaget’s theory of knowledge. An attempt to provide such a theory of knowledge we labelled “epistemology proper” or “normative epistemology.” Piaget’s constructivism, I suggested, is a theory about how we actually know. Constructivism can be viewed as an answer to the earlier (transcendental) question; how is it possible (developmentally) for us to have the knowledge we have? Piaget answers that<br>

  Abstract: Elizabeth Bishop extends Stevens’s revision of Emerson and his bipartite career by engaging in a process of “constant re-adjustment” between subject and object, mind and nature, rhetoric and meters. The seemingly contradictory commentary that her work sustains proves her success in “con-fusing” romantic and modernist oppositions: she has been read as an autobiographical poet with an impersonal touch, as a surrealist given to meticulous observations of natural facts, and as a formalist whose poems are open-ended accumulations of detail.¹ Her distinction is to have developed the kind of diction and formal flexibility that enable her to be at home on<br>

  Variations across Multiple Groups in Forms of Dreaming from:

  Abstract: It is quite clear that Freud’s and Jung’s dreams differed markedly in style or form-yet with enough overlap to suggest that they represent variations within a single dreaming process. The old saw that Freudian patients dream Freudian dreams, and Jungians dream Jungian, also seems likely, although causation is less clear. Dreaming is socially malleable, but given the differences in the dreams of the founders, it may well be that people are drawn to one tradition or the other because it mirrors their lives (awake and asleep).<br>

  Abstract: The Missionary Oblate Sisters of the Sacred Heart and Mary Immaculate (mo), a bilingual (French and English) teaching congregation, was founded by Archbishop Adélard Langevin in 1904, in Manitoba, Canada. The foundation was Langevin’s practical way of expressing his commitment to a culturally dual French-English vision of Canada, and of addressing his fears of Anglicization, which were heightened after the Manitoba government withdrew financial support for confessional schools in 1890. It was also a way to respond to the needs of the Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate in relation to the process of colonization of the Aboriginal peoples, mainly through<br>

  Book Title: Points of Departure-Rethinking Student Source Use and Writing Studies Research Methods<br>
  Publisher: Utah State University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAMIESON SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: Points of Departureencourages a return to empirical research about writing, presenting a wealth of transparent, reproducible studies of student sources. The volume shows how to develop methods for coding and characterizing student texts, their choice of source material, and the resources used to teach information literacy. In so doing, the volume advances our understanding of how students actually write.The contributors offer methodologies, techniques, and suggestions for research that move beyond decontextualized guides to grapple with the messiness of research-in-process, as well as design, development, and expansion. Serviss and Jamieson's model of RAD writing studies research is transcontextual and based on hybridized or mixed methods. Among these methods are citation context analysis, research-aloud protocols, textual and genre analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups, with an emphasis on process and knowledge as contingent. Chapters report on research projects at different stages and across institution types-from pilot to multi-site, from community college to research university-focusing on the methods and artifacts employed.A rich mosaic of research about research,Points of Departureadvances knowledge about student writing and serves as a guide for both new and experienced researchers in writing studies.Contributors: Crystal Benedicks, Katt Blackwell-Starnes, Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch, Kristi Murray Costello, Anne Diekema, Rebecca Moore Howard, Sandra Jamieson, Elizabeth Kleinfeld, Brian N.

  Author(s) Gerigk Horst-Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: Three things may be said about the lifelong polemic of Maxim Gorky (1868–1936) with Dostoevsky. First, it had deep psychological roots in a confrontation with aspects of his own nature; overcoming Dostoevsky, for Gorky, was a process of self-overcoming. Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Abstract: Debates about the legacy of colonialism in France are not new, but they have taken on new urgency in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Responding to acts of religious and racial violence in 2005, 2010, and 2015 and beyond, the essays in this volume pit French ideals against government-sponsored revisionist decrees that have exacerbated tensions, complicated the process of establishing and recording national memory, and triggered divisive debates on what it means to identify as French. As they document the checkered legacy of French colonialism, the contributors raise questions about France and the contemporary role of Islam, the banlieues, immigration, race, history, pedagogy, and the future of the Republic. This innovative volume reconsiders the cultural, economic, political, and social realities facing global French citizens today and includes contributions by Achille Mbembe, Benjamin Stora, Françoise Vergès, Alec Hargreaves,Elsa Dorlin,and Alain Mabanckou, among others.<br>

  Abstract: When it comes to the question of colonialism in France, more often than not, the tendency is to conjure a range of “philanthropic” or “humanist” measures. This is somehow deemed necessary in the process of extracting populations residing is farflung places out of the heart of darkness, and thereby justifying overseas colonial expansion. As a consequence, there has been no real debate on these and related questions, even though formerly colonized peoples and their descendants continue to be the object of racial prejudice and subjected to humiliation.

  Abstract: Levinas’s critique of narrative and the conception of the narrating subject that underlies it leads him to the issue of how time is synchronized in the philosophy of history, where the process of abstraction from the singular other is most prominent. By interpreting the significance of disparate events and integrating them into a coherent account, the disciplinary approaches of history typically assume a formal conception of time, in which a linear chronology can be represented by consciousness. In other words, past events are treated as intentional objects. This synchronization of time entails generalizing from people’s experiences, selectively emphasizing certain elements<br>

  Abstract: As techniques for conceptual modelling, enterprise modelling, and business process modelling have proliferated over the years (e.g. Olle et al., 1991), researchers and practitioners alike have attempted to determine objective bases on which to compare, evaluate, and determine when to use these different techniques (e.g. Karam and Casselman, 1993; Gorla et al., 1995) . However, throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and into the new millennium, it has become increasingly apparent to many researchers that without a theoretical foundation on which to base the specification for these various modelling techniques, incomplete evaluative frameworks of factors, features, and facets will continue to proliferate.<br>

How far back in time can such élites be traced and can their genesis be related in any way to the colonization process itself? And how were the social systems of the earliest Austronesian groups, especially in Melanesia, affected by contact with pre-existing societies, perhaps similar in terms of economy and technology but fundamentally different in terms of social ideology?<br>

  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts. Global in nature, these "culture wars" exacerbate the tensions between tradition and innovation, virtue and freedom. Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

  Abstract: As the saying goes: the center does not hold. If one were to highlight a central feature of the modern age, one could plausibly point to its centrifugal momentum, its tendency toward fragmentation. In the intellectual domain, the tendency is patently evident in the process of specialization, the relentless segregation of fields of knowledge. However, the trend exceeds the knowledge domain. Together with other thinkers of his time, the philosopher Hegel saw modernity marked by radical “diremptions” or divisions (
                  Entzweiungen)—divisions between knowledge and action, thinking and feeling, private self-interest and the common good—with the prospects of reconciliation growing<br>

  Abstract: “Mobilizing democracy” is a stirring catchphrase, and it was a well-chosen theme for the 2005 meeting of one of the largest social science associations in the United States.¹ In choosing that theme, the organizers obviously wanted to establish a broad agenda, both nationally and globally. In fact, although couched as an ongoing process, the motto can readily be translated into a directive or even an imperative that postulates “mobilize democracy” or “spread democracy everywhere” or simply “democratize the world.” The directive is stirring and captivating—but also disorienting, given the serious malaise afflicting contemporary democracy both at home and abroad.<br>

  Abstract: The process of hermeneutical retrieval presupposes that the one who is attempting the retrieval is dealing adequately and fairly with the classic text, doctrine, or principle in question. While this is obvious, it offers a challenge to the one who would engage in a process of retrieval. A worthy process of retrieval demands that the classic element be dealt with in as balanced a manner as possible, without giving up the integrity of the process by highlighting only those aspects of the classic element that one either endorses or reviles.

  Abstract: Angelo Roncalli became Pope John XXIII when I was sixteen. After eight years of parochial school and three years in a Jesuit high school, I thought I knew what it meant to be Catholic. And in one sense I did. I knew the liturgy of the Mass, the biblical stories, the seven sacraments, the Apostles’ Creed, a partial history of the Church, the importance of love and forgiveness. This early formation begun at home has never deserted me. Still, the unexpected selection of Pope John XXIII began a process of personal transformation that continues to this day.

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

Muslims and Christians alike know themselves to be mandated by divine imperatives, informed by divine values, which must be offered to the task of reshaping the world in which they live. It is questionable indeed whether the process of interpretation and application that enables this can be straightforward even in religiously homogeneous contexts; it certainly is much more complex in societies marked by both religious diversity and a measure of<br>

  Book Title: Ethics in Light of Childhood-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall John<br>
  Abstract: Childhood faces humanity with its own deepest and most perplexing questions. An ethics that truly includes the world's childhoods would transcend pre-modern traditional communities and modern rational autonomy with a postmodern aim of growing responsibility. It would understand human relations in a poetic rather than universalistic sense as openly and interdependently creative. As a consequence, it would produce new understandings of moral being, time, and otherness, as well as of religion, rights, narrative, families, obligation, and power.
      Ethics in Light of Childhoodfundamentally reimagines ethical thought and practice in light of the experiences of the third of humanity who are children. Much like humanism, feminism, womanism, and environmentalism, Wall argues, a new childism is required that transforms moral thinking, relations, and societies in fundamental ways. Wall explores childhood's varied impacts on ethical thinking throughout history, advances the emerging interdisciplinary field of childhood studies, and reexamines basic assumptions in contemporary moral theory and practice. In the process, he does not just apply ethics to childhood but applies childhood to ethics-in order to imagine a more expansive humanity.<br>

  Abstract: Bridge concepts aim to provoke accounts of widely separated figures in terms of a common set of topics that highlight particular points of similarity and difference. By creating more precise points of contact, the comparativist can provide the basis for an imaginary dialogue between the two positions thus articulated and thereby pursue more substantive investigations of the general topic the bridge concept specifies. Thus a bridge concept like “human nature” can serve to generate what might be called a

  Book Title: Genuine Multiculturalism-The Tragedy and Comedy of Diversity<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): FOSTER CECIL<br>
  Abstract: While many modern societies are noted for their diversity, the resulting challenge is to determine how citizens from different backgrounds and cultures can see themselves and each other as equals, and be treated equally. In Genuine Multiculturalism, Cecil Foster shows that a society's failure to bridge these differences is the tragedy of modern living and that pretending it is possible to mechanically develop fraternity and solidarity among diverse groups is akin to seeking out comedy. Arguing that genuine multiculturalism is the search for social justice by individuals who have been trapped by ascribed identities or newcomers who have been shut out of perceived ethnic homelands, Foster details how this process, in essence, is the story of the Americas. Reconceptionalizing the terms of multiculturalism, he offers an intervention into Canada's claim that its definition and practice are based on recognizing equality of citizenship. Identifying genuine multiculturalism as an ongoing work in progress, rather than a tightly defined policy position, Foster challenges readers to imagine a greater and more harmonious ideal. A necessary theoretical reconsideration of diversity within society, Genuine Multiculturalism refocuses the debate about ideals and practices in modern societies.<br>

Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

This movement, however, has also been answered with renewed versions of the traditional functionalist and behaviorist rejections of the study of consciousness as anything other than an incidental by-product of computational capacity (Dennett, 1991). Consciousness is seen as private and hence outside scientific scrutiny, confabulated and deluded in its pretended access to cognitive process, and ultimately nonfunctional.

In contrast to clear and distinct conceptual knowledge, sensuous knowledge is acognitio confusa, a confused knowledge form. “It is not aimed at distinctions; it pursues an animated intertwinement of aspects even when it is a matter of a stationary object. It lingers at a process of appearing,” Martin Seel remarks.¹ These processes of aesthetic appearing involve compounds of sensation or what I will call figures of sensation.<br>

  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

  Author(s) BLADOW KYLE<br>
  Abstract: If bioregionalism is viewed narrowly, with a bioregion seen as a distinct natural region or a local place touted for its specialities, the feral may function as an unwelcome or invasive intrusion. In this narrow view, the energy of the local is focused on expelling, demonizing, marginalizing, and even destroying the feral. Generally, the feral can be understood as a state that lies somewhere between domesticated and wild. Ferality is implicitly accepted as a natural process: what happens when a domestic escapes, is released, or is transported into another bioregion; or conversely, what happens when the wild thing shifts or<br>

  Author(s) Deacon Belle<br>
  Abstract: Ethnographies always begin as conversations between anthropologists and our hosts, who are, in turn, in conversation with each other. If we are fortunate, some of these conversations take unexpected turns, develop into genuine dialogues, and continue over many years. Dialogues open the possibility that we may learn something about the process of communication, about how words can be used to construct meaningful accounts of life experience. In this way, they differ fundamentally from structured interviews, where one of the participants claims rights both to pose the questions and interpret the responses.<br>

  Book Title: The Sacredness of the Person-A New Genealogy of Human Rights<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: According to Joas, every single human being has increasingly been viewed as sacred. He discusses the abolition of torture and slavery, once common practice in the pre-18th century west, as two milestones in modern human history. The author concludes by portraying the emergence of the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 as a successful process of value generalization. Joas demonstrates that the history of human rights cannot adequately be described as a history of ideas or as legal history, but as a complex transformation in which diverse cultural traditions had to be articulated, legally codified, and assimilated into practices of everyday life. The sacralization of the person and universal human rights will only be secure in the future, warns Joas, through continued support by institutions and society, vigorous discourse in their defense, and their incarnation in everyday life and practice.<br>

  Abstract: So far in my attempt to construct an affirmative genealogy of human rights I have placed great emphasis on the importance of subjective certainty, the sense of self-evidence and affective intensity of the kind characteristic of the sacred. I have portrayed the genesis and development of human rights as a history of the relocating of such self-evidence, a process that straddles the spheres of practices, values, and institutions. So experiences are an important driving force in this history—everyday experiences, but above all experiences that transcend the everyday, that fill actors with enthusiasm or affect them profoundly as their horror<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Abstract: Taken together, the essays make four important and interrelated contributions to our understanding of the mental status of the elderly. First, cross-cultural data show that the aging process, while biologically influenced, is also culturally constructed. Second, ethnographic reports raise questions about the diagnostic criteria used for defining the elderly as demented. Third, case studies show how a diagnosis affects a patient's treatment in both clinical and familial settings. Finally, the collection highlights the gap that separates current biological understandings of aging from its cultural meanings.<br>

In a dialogical theological conversation, it instills a “tragic vision” that contributes to a “fullness of insight into the human condition” (1992, 9).

  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Hattam Victoria<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on the rich cache of antidualist theoretical traditions, from poststructuralism and ecological theory to constructivism and pragmatism, a diverse group of scholars probes acts of social innovation in many locations: land boards in Botswana, Russian labor relations, international statistics, global supply chains, Islamic economics in Algeria, Islamic sects and state authority in Senegal, and civil rights reform, colonization, industrial policy, and political consulting in the United States. These political scientists reconceptualize

  Abstract: In this chapter, we argue that the origins of both institutional order and change lie in human creativity. In a previous article, we looked at institutions from the inside out.¹ From that perspective, we showed how people experience institutional rules as bundles of resources available for creative reinterpretation and recombination. We called this process “creative syncretism” and conjectured that it produced institutional order and change simultaneously. In this work, we unpack creative syncretism by conceptualizing the interplay among creative projects undertaken by the powerful and the weak in the name of both seat-of-the-pants problem solving and grand institutional engineering.

  Abstract: Rather than place Coleridge in the narrative of rhetoric’s retreat and return, either in retreat as Richard Young does or in return as James Berlin does, Paul Kameen’s reading seems to place Coleridge elsewhere. Certainly Kameen is interested in the ways Coleridge can expand the field’s conceptions of rhetorical invention and the composing process, but his rearticulation of Coleridge goes beyond the revaluation of the romantic individual. If Coleridge is read as espousing a complex relationship among the world, the body, the mind, and writing, then his importance clearly goes beyond mystical genius.

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

  Abstract: Insofar as film scholarship followed literary studies, in the 1980s and 1990s, in taking up Benedict Anderson’s work on the construction of national identity through imagined communities, much attention has been devoted to looking at French films that participate in that process by construing colonized peoples as primitive and frequently feminized ‘Others’, in opposition to whom the French define themselves as rational, enlightened and civilized. Like the films themselves, the analyses vary in the degree to which they see colonizer/colonized relations in terms of stark binaries or in terms of ambiguous hybrid identities on both sides.

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

Unlike the geographical journey of migration, however, narrative is not a linear process. Instead, it possesses an inherent temporal elasticity that often enables writers to deploy inventive methods and modes of storytelling and characterization. Rather than simply providing a series of period snapshots, these texts reveal how identities are configured over time as well as space. In other words, they<br>

  Abstract: Wittgenstein is said (by the editors of his

  Abstract: New knowledge may take many forms, ranging from art works to personal narratives to mathematical theorems to scientific findings. Such knowledge emerging from the research process is most often in the form of theory. Theory, like research, has many definitions and applications. Some of these are narrow and restrictive, requiring a theory to be derived from quantifiable data and capable of being tested. Other definitions are more inclusive and consider a theory to be a systematically organized set of statements that analyze and explain the nature and behavior of a specified set of phenomena. This understanding includes those theories resulting<br>

For the writing of art history one used to be able to rely on the art objects. When artworks become prone to obsolescence or are only meant to exist for a short period, documentation is the only thing people can fall back on.

Because the conflict occurred during a time of statelessness in Bougainville, space was opened for a renaissance of nonstate customary institutions and processes.

  Book Title: Relative Histories-Mediating History in Asian American Family Memoirs<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Rocío G.<br>
  Abstract: Relative Histories focuses on the Asian American memoir that specifically recounts the story of at least three generations of the same family. This form of auto/biography concentrates as much on other members of one’s family as on oneself, generally collapses the boundaries conventionally established between biography and autobiography, and in many cases—as Rocío G. Davis proposes for the auto/biographies of ethnic writers—crosses the frontier into history, promoting collective memory. Davis centers on how Asian American family memoirs expand the limits and function of life writing by reclaiming history and promoting community cohesion. She argues that identity is shaped by not only the stories we have been told, but also the stories we tell, making these narratives important examples of the ways we remember our family’s past and tell our community’s story. In the context of auto/biographical writing or filmmaking that explores specific ethnic experiences of diaspora, assimilation, and integration, this work considers two important aspects: These texts re-imagine the past by creating a work that exists both in history and as a historical document, making the creative process a form of re-enactment of the past itself. Each chapter centers on a thematic concern germane to the Asian American experience: the narrative of twentieth-century Asian wars and revolutions, which has become the subtext of a significant number of Asian American family memoirs (Pang-Mei Natasha Chang’s Bound Feet and Western Dress, May-lee and Winberg Chai’s The Girl from Purple Mountain, K. Connie Kang’s Home Was The Land of Morning Calm, Doung Van Mai Elliott’s The Sacred Willow); family experiences of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which unveil a history of multiple diasporas that are often elided after families immigrate to the United States (Helie Lee’s Still Life With Rice, Jael Silliman’s Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames, Mira Kamdar’s M~<br>

  Book Title: Out of the Margins-The Rise of Chinese Vernacular Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Ge Liangyan<br>
  Abstract: The novel Water Margin (Shuihu zhuan), China's earliest full-length narrative in vernacular prose, first appeared in print in the sixteenth century. The tale of one hundred and eight bandit heroes evolved from a long oral tradition; in its novelized form, it played a pivotal role in the rise of Chinese vernacular fiction, which flourished during the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) periods. Liangyan Ge's multidimensional study considers the evolution of Water Margin and the rise of vernacular fiction against the background of the vernacularization of premodern Chinese literature as a whole. This gradual and arduous process, as the book convincingly shows, was driven by sustained contact and interaction between written culture and popular orality. Ge examines the stylistic and linguistic features of the novel against those of other works of early Chinese vernacular literature (stories, in particular), revealing an accretion of features typical of different historical periods and a prolonged and cumulative process of textualization. In addition to providing a meticulous philological study, his work offers a new reading of the novel that interprets some of its salient characteristics in terms of the interplay between audience, storytellers, and men of letters associated with popular orality.<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

Insofar as the Bali Aga have been portrayed with a negative bias by other, more powerful Balinese people, I assume that there is a moral responsibility to amplify their counterdiscourses. At the same time, Balinese identities are the product of a historical and intersubjective process in which the Bali Aga have participated with an ambivalent attitude of competition as well as cooperation. In adopting this perspective, I aim to prevent a fetishization<br>

Doing Justice to Mercy challenges this assumption by presenting the reader with an urgent conversation between the law and religion that yields a constructive approach, both theoretically and practically, to the complex role of mercy in our legal process.<br>

Simply, self-consciousness is enacted through self-reflexivity, and in this process of self-awareness, identity emerges. But the word “reflexivity” has a more circumscribed history. Reflexivity appears as a paradigm of understanding the self during the early modern period, coincident with the preoccupation with optics and the birth of a new physics of light. “Reflexivity” was first applied to cognitive introspection, in referring to “thought as bending back upon itself,” in the 1640s, when theologians,<br>

  Abstract: After Quebec, our attention turns to Mexico and Latin America (Map 1). Considering the continent’s diversity, it might appear surprising that this inquiry starts with Mexico and then spills into the whole of Latin America.¹ Yet, beyond their important distinguishing features, I believe that the collectivities of this continent shared dreams, problems, and historical experiences that legitimize my approach. Moreover, the act of recognizing elements of a common narrative can, in turn, shed light on particular trajectories. In describing the process whereby European immigrants appropriated these new spaces between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, I use the concept of “Americanization”<br>

However, whereas Ernest Gellner said of nationalism that it is able to invent nations even where they do not exist, Anderson (1983, 6) asserts that the process of nation-creating is not so much one of false fabrication as it is one of active creation: in a sense there are no “true” communities that can be juxtaposed to “false,” or invented,<br>

  Abstract: While the plays that follow the tragedies and conclude Shakespeare’s career seem to belong to a different world from the tragedies, the differences do not eradicate some fundamental social continuities. The romances still observe Renaissance social decorum, bestowing the most serious roles on the social elite and depicting them in greater numbers than their inferiors, in defiance of Jacobean social reality. In contrast to the tragedies, redemptive symbols in the late plays are vindicated, and hard won self-knowledge is cherished by cosmic hope.

  Abstract: Investigating autobiographical writing of Mary McCarthy, Henry James, Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Friedlander, and Maxine Hong Kingston, this book argues that autobiographical truth is not a fixed but an evolving content in a process of self-creation. Further, Paul John Eakin contends, the self at the center of all autobiography is necessarily fictive. Professor Eakin shows that the autobiographical impulse is simply a special form of reflexive consciousness: from a developmental viewpoint, the autobiographical act is a mode of self-invention always practiced first in living and only eventually, and occasionally, in writing.<br>

  Abstract: Recent insights into the nature of representation and power relations have signaled an important shift in perspective on anthropology: from a fieldwork-based "science" of culture to an interpretive activity bound to the discursive and ideological process called "text-making." This collection of essays reflects the ongoing cross-fertilization between literary criticism and anthropology. Focusing on texts written or influenced by anthropologists between 1900 and 1945, the work relates current perspectives on anthropology's discursive nature to the literary period known as "Modernism.".<br>

Despite the bleakness of Hardy’s outlook—his view of life as an inherently unsanctioned process, an empty sequence of happenstances—he retained an enabling attachment (however complicated) to his native Dorset countryside. He absorbed its legends, its history, its customs, its landscape; and these absorptions may account for the modulated tone of even his darkest utterances. He is not surprised, his tone keeps repeating, because what is human history if not the immemorial story of expectation drained dry by time’s passage?<br>

  Author(s): RUTLAND BARRY<br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine a community that is not divided into at least two gender groups. It is equally impossible to imagine a community that does not tell or enact stories. The relationship between these universal aspects of human culture is the mainspring of Gender and Narrativity. From Genesis to Freud, the Western narrative tradition tells the same old story of masculine dominance/feminine subservience as a matter of divine will or natural truth. Here, nine Canadian scholars challenge and interpret this tradition, in effect "re-telling" the story of gender, and themselves intervening in the narrative process. Critical readings from a wide range of literary texts - medieval and modern, European and Canadian - replace abstract theory in these studies, while sociology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and new history are the axes of discussion. This book exemplifies the current range and diversity of Canadian critical writing.<br>

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): SMYTHE KAREN E.<br>
  Abstract: The title, Figuring Grief, refers to the narrative process whereby mourning is depicted. In her textual analysis, Smythe explores various connections between representation and consolation. Drawing on genre and narratological theory, she outlines the development of the "fiction-elegy" as a sub-genre and suggests that the modernist writings of Woolf and Joyce are paradigmatic examples of the form. She then uses these paradigms as suggestive "reading models" for the interpretation of works by Gallant, Munro, and other contemporary fiction-elegists. Figuring Grief offers new readings of specific works and suggests that new ways of reading are both demanded and rewarded by a poetics of elegy.<br>

  Contemporary Fiction-Elegy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt818sp">Figuring Grief</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 2 I argued that Gallant figures the elegiac in her fiction in a variety of ways, including the use of plot as trope, experimentation with contrasting points of view, and the subversion of sequential chronology. The work of mourning is demonstrated in Gallant’s stories to be a form of “narrative thinking,” which, according to John Robinson and Linda Hawpe, “consists of creating a fit between a situation and the story schema. Establishing a fit, that is, making a story out of experience, is a heuristic process,” they continue, “one which requires skill, judgment, and experience.”¹ The reader, too,<br>

  Book Title: Ghost Brothers-Adoption of a French Tribe by Bereaved Native America: A Transdisciplinary Longitudinal Multilevel Integrated Analysis<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): BLUM RONY<br>
  Abstract: Devastating losses caused by diseases such as smallpox led to an epidemic of bereavement among the Natives. This loss resonated with the French, who had dealt with smaller epidemics in France and were also mourning their absent communities through a nostalgia for home. Blum traces how ghosts provided transgenerational and transcultural links that guided understanding rather than encouraging violence. Ghost Brothers insightfully examines the process of this colonial interdependent alliance between Native and European worlds.<br>

  Abstract: The debate on Asian values has expanded considerably in the last couple of decades. At the core of Asian values lies Confucian familism, with its emphasis on human-relatedness. Feminists have exposed the oppressive potential of the resurgence of Confucian familism and challenged the Confucian concept of family. In this chapter, I first will juxtapose Confucian and Christian familism, and critically reevaluate them from a feminist perspective. In the process, I will explore the similarities and differences between the two concepts of familism. Second, I shall put Confucian familism under scrutiny, and show how people in Korea have practiced it in<br>

  Subversive Eschatology and “Indirect Ecumenism” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0t4j">Hope in Action</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 1, we saw that Metz’s eschatological project developed out of his theological analysis of the modern process of secularization, was unduly limited by his transcendental-linear theology of history, and gradually emerged as a practical-critical hope for the future. Now, turning to Edward Schillebeeckx’s efforts to address the apologetic consequences of secularization during the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, we will trace similar developments that unfold over significantly different terrain; Schillebeeckx offered a distinctive response to the same historical challenges, yet during this period the doctrine of eschatology also would move to the center of his theological project.<br>

  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, various themes arose to prominence within the mind of the church. Some surfaced from within, by the natural process of maturation and development, while others resulted from sharp reminders given by a rapidly changing secular world. Among these, perhaps the most significant, and that because its influence was so far-reaching, was the awakening to a sense of history.¹ This questioned fundamentally the prevailing certainties of knowledge, and had the potential to transform the intellectual disciplines completely. To become aware of historicity is to acknowledge a sense of contingency, pluralism, and the possibility of change. Much that<br>

  Book Title: Reading Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Reading is one of the basic skills a student needs. But reading is not just an activity of the eyes and the brain. Reading Theologically, edited by Eric D. Barreto, brings together eight seminary educators from a variety of backgrounds to explore what it means to be a reader in a seminary context--to read theologically. Reading theologically involves a specific minset adn posture towards texts and ideas, people and communities alike. Reading theologically is not just about academic skill building but about the formation of a ministerial leader who can engage scholarship critically, interpret Scripture and tradition faithfully, welcome different perspectives, and help lead others to do the same. This brief, readable, edited volume emphasizes the vital skills, habits, practices, and values involved in reading theologically. Reading Theologically is a vital resource for students beginning the seminary process and professors of introductory level seminary courses.<br>

In recent history, this genealogy finds its advent in the seminal work of John Milbank, and it is upon the foundation of his work that others have constructed edifices built on the narrative of Scotus astheprotomodern antagonist. Displacing the early modern Enlightenment thinkers, Scotus serves as the inaugurator of all that is ill with modernity.

Undeniably, dialogue may be the means by which a theological work comes into being as a published product,¹ but the emphasis and priority often lie not on this process but on the goal—the end result that entails distinct, definitive claims that can be accessed online or sent to press. In other words, as it concerns theological method, most theological work is primarily teleological in focus,² and while such an approach<br>

For, if the symbiotic relationship between the natural and the supernatural order of events is working properly, then there should be no need for God to suspend or even to tinker with the normal workings of nature so as to help human beings to deal with some catastrophic series of events in the world of nature<br>

  Abstract: Since his own assent to the Adversary’s acts of torture in Job 2, God has not spoken—a haunting silence. As Paul Ricoeur explains, the process of narrativization can proceed with two distinct effects: (1) The narrative interprets by way of amplification or explanation, by providing a “why” (God did this
                  because…), or (2) the “inverse of amplification,” or “reticence.”¹ Opacity has its own power—the longer the Joban characters have argued about Job’s personal relationship to nature and wrongdoing, the longer God is silent, and the more intensely the characters must wonder about the divine perspective.

  Abstract: Inspired by the Rhetoric Culture Project, this volume focuses on the use of imagery, narrative, and cultural schemes to deal with predicaments that arise during the course of life. The contributors explore how people muster their resources to understand and deal with emergencies such as illness, displacement, or genocide. In dealing with such circumstances, people can develop new rhetorical forms and, in the process, establish new cultural resources for succeeding generations. Several of the contributions show how rhetorical cultural forms can themselves create emergencies. The contributors bring expertise from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology and communications studies, underlining the volume's wider relevance as a reflection on the human condition.<br>

The catastrophic experiences of the first half of the twentieth century contributed considerably to this. They created, according to Dan Diner in his European-oriented, universalhistorical attempt to understand this period, a separate ‘time of remembrance’, whose ‘negative telos’ overlaid other experiences and taught us to view history differently (Diner 2000: 17).

Rather, representing something by remembering it creates an experiential context along the lines of “Things are just like they were back then.” Genuine remembering is a process of transporting oneself back, of retrieving a past emotional situation.

  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Archer Neil<br>
  Abstract: The traditionally American genre of the road movie has been explored and reconfigured in the French context since the later 1960s. Comparative in its approach, this book studies the inter-relationship between American and French culture and cinemas, and in the process considers and challenges histories of the road movie. It combines film history with film theory methodologies, analysing transformations in social, political and film-industrial contexts alongside changing perspectives on the meaning and possibilities of film. At once chronological and thematic in structure,
      The French Road Movieprovides in each chapter a comprehensive introduction to key themes emerging from the genre in the French context - liberty, identity and citizenship, masculinity, femininity, border-crossing - followed by detailed, innovative and often revisionist readings of the chosen films. Through these readings the author justifies the place of the road genre within French cinema histories and reinvigorates this often neglected and misunderstood area of study.<br>

  Abstract: If what we understand by ‘transnational cinema’ is to a large extent still a definition in progress, the connection between mobility and travel within the terms of the transnational has assumed critical currency. To suggest that this is a necessary connection is really to beg the question, in fact, of what transnational means, and more specifically what is at stake in the process of naming it. This is an important task, given that the recent topicality of transnational cinema, as far as its academic study is concerned, is based less on its status as a cinematic trend, than on the<br>

  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

Pushing these kind of “social” responsibilities on schools is a process that has been under way for a long time and coincides with the role of education in the formation of the modern nation-state.

  Author(s) VISSER-FUCHS Livia<br>
  Abstract: ‘Compilation’ is a largely self-explanatory term. Used of a medieval literary activity, it refers to a recycling process whereby extracts culled from a variety of manuscript sources are cobbled together to create new texts. In a crude, although convenient, analogy, one might suggest that compiling is the textual equivalent of creating a mosaic – the fragments originally belong to very different contexts, a certain amount of compiler-provided ‘grout’ holds the entirety together, and the end product is a quite distinct artefact in itself. In the twelfth and thirteen centuries, learned Irishmen expended a great deal of energy in this direction,<br>

  Author(s) De Kesel Marc<br>
  Abstract: Griesinger and Kraepelin qualified paranoia as one of the three major psychotic disorders, together with schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis (Griesinger 1845, Kraepelin 1915). In psychoanalytic thinking, paranoia even became the paradigmatic form of psychosis. Freud’s only case-studies of psychotic patients, for instance, were devoted to paranoid individuals (Freud 1911, Freud 1915). Jacques Lacan (1988), and to a lesser degree Melanie Klein (1946), pursued this line of thinking by considering paranoia as the essence of the psychotic process (Roudinesco & Plon 1997). Contemporary psychiatric nosography, however, handles schizophrenia as the central taxon. In fact, schizophrenia has become a more or less generic<br>

  Abstract: In some Muslim quarters, there is a lingering, and even increasing skepticism over the universal validity of human rights. those quarters may consider human rights as vehicles of Western arrogance and supremacy that run roughshod over deeply held cultural and religious convictions. Such skepticism demonstrates that human rights are still in what An Na’im has termed ‘a process of universalization’. Their full realization is an aim to which all States have committed themselves, and which is dependent on (1) domestic political willingness and strong institutions, (2) grassroots support, (3) international assistance, and (4) evenhandedness.

  Author(s) Wilson Lee<br>
  Abstract: Consumption has been theorized as a process of appropriation (Miller 1997) where consumers adjust, reframe, hack, or otherwise infuse their own meanings and intentions into the commodities they buy and use. Information and communications technologies (ICTs) are no exception (Horst and Miller 2006; Burrell 2011). Designers of ICTs are increasingly recognizing consumer appropriation in various ways. One way is to hire anthropologists and user experience researchers to conduct what is called user-centered design. This enables firms to better understand and anticipate the ways consumers might appropriate their products. Although fully predicting those uses is impossible, the premise of user-centered design<br>

  Abstract: The “Afro” style of movement and performance began in Brazil in the seventies among radicalized sectors of the Black-mixtured community as a way to recuperate and politicize inherited African cultural practices that had been co-opted by the dictatorship as simply folklore, part of “our Brazilian Heritage.” Twenty years later, it appears that this particular style of dance has a fixed set of codes from which the dancer may construct/choreograph meaning into a performance. This position, however, reinstates the paradigm of the “folk” into a dynamic process of identification, communication, and insertion within transnational discourses about the various cultures of people<br>

  Abstract: The jurisprudential movements of the 1980s deepened and advanced a process of crisis and transition in modern jurisprudence. The most striking facet of this transformation has been the success of new forms of jurisprudential discourse or “law talk” in penetrating, subverting, and decentering the conventional forms of legal discourse. The proliferation of different jurisprudential discourses has erased the lines between description and advocacy, making it much more difficult for traditionalists to maintain their belief in neutral and objective law.

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: This study argues that the political and legislative process of forgetting internal differences, undertaken in France after the civil wars of the sixteenth century, leads to subtle yet fundamental shifts in the broader conception of the relationship between readers or spectators on the one hand, and the matter of history, on the other. These shifts, occasioned by the desire for communal reconciliation and generally associated with an increasingly modern sensibility, will nonetheless prove useful to the ideologies of cultural and political absolutism.<br>

  Abstract: To rehearse: what has been established under the heading of differential narratology is becoming as it pertains to narrative, narrativity in constant variation generating ever new variants of narrative; the virtual dance of narrative differentials producing actual, numerically differentiated narratives; the intensive sensations and forces of transcendental Narrative (affects, percepts, forces) bringing about the extensive states of affairs and networks of empirical narratives (events, existents, plots). In short, becoming, the dynamic and continuous process of selecting and gathering heterogeneous elements to be expressed, has been revealed as the ontologically primary virtual realm of any given actual narrative.

  Abstract: Philosophies of difference, where difference holds its ground without being subordinated to identity, are exceedingly rare. It is not by chance that the fortunes of philosophical heterologies are better served inside process philosophies. Although to be a process philosopher is not a guarantee that one will also be a philosopher of pure difference, movement and the reflection on movement that constitute the raison d’être of the philosophies of process offer a rich soil for the nurture of difference. But a process philosophy, in order to support a purely heterological thought, has to be capable of doing without subjects steering the<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will examine social philosophy in the nineteenth century in terms of three interrelated processes: the consolidation of a conception of society or the social; the reformulation of issues of poverty and inequality in the form of ‘the social question’ and related attempts at social regulation; and the emergence of the social sciences ‘between literature and science’ (see Lepenies [1985] 1988). Although the term ‘rise’ may seem to suggest an inevitable or desirable process, we shall see that the status of the social sciences and the relation between the social and the political were no less contentious at the<br>

  Abstract: The democratisation of South Africa has become widely celebrated. Apartheid, a legalised system of white domination over a majority black population imposed by post-1948 National Party (NP) governments, was peculiarly vilified in a post-Nazi, post-colonial world. By the 1980s, the polarisation between pro-democratic forces and the regime was threatening conflagration of the most advanced industrial economy in Africa. Yet in 1994 South Africa held a first democratic election following a four-year transition process whereby previously warring parties negotiated a highly praised constitution founded upon human equality, liberal democracy, a separation of powers, minority representation and socio-economic as well as individual<br>

The Czech language itself, as a network of concepts, conceptual links and linguistic habits, had been remodelled by the forces of the Marxist–Leninist worldview. This was by no means a one-way process: on the contrary, the concepts of ‘people’, ‘folk’ and ‘nation’ which were fundamental to the communist worldview were modelled using the plastic material of the Czech imagination, an<br>

  Book Title: Memory and the Moving Image-French Film in the Digital Era<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): McNeill Isabelle<br>
  Abstract: A vital rethinking of memory and the moving image for the digital age, Isabelle McNeill investigates the role of the moving image in cultural memory, considering the impact of digital technologies on visual culture. Drawing on an interdisciplinary range of theoretical resources and an unusual body of films and moving image works, the author examines the ways in which recent French filmmaking conceptualises both the past and the workings of memory. Ultimately the author argues that memory is an intersubjective process, in which filmic forms continue to play a crucial role even as new media come to dominate our contemporary experience.Memory and the Moving Image:*Introduces new ways of thinking about the relation between film and memory, arising from a compelling, interdisciplinary study of theories and films*Subtly explores the French context while drawing theoretical conclusions with wider implications and applicability*Provides detailed and illuminating close readings of varied moving image works to aid theoretical explorations*Moves away from auteurist approaches, examining work by canonical directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Chris Marker and Agnès Varda alongside that of less well-known filmmakers such as Claire Simon and Yamina Benguigui*Brings together thinkers such as Bergson, Deleuze, Bazin and Barthes with, for example, Rodowick and Mulvey, in an engaging interweaving of theories.Works considered include Jean-Luc Godard's Histoire(s) du Cinéma (1989-98), Yamina Benguigui's Mémoires d'Immigrés (1997), Chris Marker's CD-ROM Immemory (1998), Claire Simon's Mimi (2003), Michael Haneke's Caché (2005) and Agnès Varda's multi-media exhibition, L'Île et Elle (2006).<br>

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

Joseph Agassi argues that magic consists of techniques, though unscientific ones.¹ The swing-era ballad “Oh, Look At Me Now” mentions “technique of kisses.” But techniques can also be much more narrowly defined to include only fully articulated and independently recognized practices that are specifically identified and studied as techniques (the “Alexander technique”).<br>

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Book Title: Microdramas-Crucibles for Theater and Time<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Muse John H.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Microdramas, John H. Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater.Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamental and about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance.<br>

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars.

  Abstract: Whether or not we remember our dreams upon waking, it is part of the human condition to dream when we sleep. For some of us, this natural brain function brings powerful somatic experiences that demand our immediate attention. Those images that haunt us long after the visual stimulus has disappeared are often very vivid somatic sensations that rush through our bodies and shock us into an awareness of a highly significant psychic process at work within us. In dreamtime, an embodied image can be experienced on a somatic level with a wide variety of possible manifestations. These physical responses of<br>

This new currency series—like the two that preceded it in 1969–79 and 1986—was publicized as bearing increased security features that would be difficult to counterfeit, news welcomed by many Canadians. While the upgrading of banknotes is a routine occurrence, this particular one became the subject of controversy nearly a year later when several news outlets revealed that, during the design process for this new banknote, the bank’s focus groups<br>

  Abstract: The historical chapters of this work provide a narrative frame that informs this chapter’s discussion of continuity and change in olonkho performance. Measuring change for intangible cultural heritage remains a complicated process, but sociolinguists have found ways to address issues of language shift that may contribute helpful models for assessing music shift as well. Without drawing overly strict, problematic parallels between language and music (Tilley 2014, 487), sociolinguistic and other communication-based models can be modified effectively for measuring change in forms of artistic expression. In addition, these approaches highlight key factors related to resilience, thereby providing strategic insights into encouraging<br>

  Abstract: Dance is usually considered the most ephemeral form of art in Western society. This transitory character of dance dominates both historical and contemporary discourse. Nonetheless, historical investigations trace not only the history of dance, but also demonstrate how dance embodies historic and cultural corporealities. Only in more recent years, however, has a focus on history and memory appeared in research on contemporary European concert dance.

  Abstract: From Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke, to Jürgen Habermas, social theorists have long argued that political transformations rest on a foundation of reasoned public critiques. Habermas contended that widespread public debate about—and criticism of—official government policies first developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through a process of rational disputation conducted via the press. For Habermas, emotion had no part to play in this idealized political process. Instead, he applauded “the critical judgment of the public making use of its reason.” From his contemporary eighteenth-century vantage point, Bolingbroke too saw little efficacy in emotion.

Take for instance, biology, a historical discipline if there ever was one: since its object is understood to change through time, it would be impossible without this ground (arche).

  Abstract: Khalaf concludes that Lebanon is now at a crossroads in its process of political and social transformation, and proposes some strategies to re-create a vibrant civil and political culture that can accommodate profound transformations in the internal, domestic sphere as well as mediate developments taking place internationally. Throughout, Khalaf demonstrates how the internal and external currents must be considered simultaneously in order to understand the complex and tragic history of the country. This deeply considered and subtle analysis of the interplay of complex historical forces helps us to imagine a viable future not only for Lebanon but also for the Middle East as a whole.<br>

  Abstract: All human action, all political and subjective agency, entails a conceptual framework within which actors make sense of their actions and projects. The concepts I have discussed in this book entailed the disclosure of a new way of thinking about politics during the eighteenth century, which transformed the way social agents saw themselves, their experiences, and their future.¹ This process allowed them to imagine concepts such as critique, emancipation, and the political role of civil society as part of negotiating the space between their expectations and their actual political experiences. After examining six different models of secularization, it is appropriate<br>

  Abstract: The collection undertakes extensive readings of major scriptural catalogs from the early manuscript era as well as major printed editions, including the Kaibao Canon, Qisha Canon, Goryeo Canon, and Taisho Canon. Contributors add fascinating depth to such understudied issues as the historical process of compilation, textual manipulation, physical production and management, sponsorship, the dissemination of various editions, cultic activities surrounding the canon, and the canon's reception in different East Asian societies. The Chinese Buddhist canon is one of the most enduring textual traditions in East Asian religion and culture, and through this exhaustive, multifaceted effort, an essential body of work becomes part of a new, versatile narrative of East Asian Buddhism that has far-reaching implications for world history.<br>

  Book Title: Cosmopolitanism in Mexican Visual Culture-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández María<br>
  Abstract: Since the colonial era, Mexican art has emerged from an ongoing process of negotiation between the local and the global, which frequently involves invention, synthesis, and transformation of diverse discursive and artistic traditions. In this pathfinding book, María Fernández uses the concept of cosmopolitanism to explore this important aspect of Mexican art, in which visual culture and power relations unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. She argues that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization constructed power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent nation-state. Accordingly, Fernández presents not only the visual qualities of objects, but also the discourses, ideas, desires, and practices that are fundamental to the very existence of visual objects.<br>

  Abstract: Reading the lives of the saints not primarily as historical documents but as iconic expressions of original artworks fashioned by the eucharistic Christ, Astell puts the "faceless" Host in a dynamic relationship with these icons. With the advent of each new spirituality, the Christian idea of beauty expanded to include, first, the marred beauty of the saint and, finally, that of the church torn by division-an anti-aesthetic beauty embracing process, suffering, deformity, and disappearance, as well as the radiant lightness of the resurrected body. This astonishing work of intellectual and religious history is illustrated with telling artistic examples ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to sculptures by Michelangelo and paintings by Salvador Dalí. Astell puts the lives of medieval saints in conversation with modern philosophers as disparate as Simone Weil and G. W. F. Hegel.<br>

  Abstract: The limitations of rights analysis were not unknown to the reformers who challenged the institutional treatment of mentally retarded people. They worked within a rights framework but also looked to other disciplines to reimagine the legal entitlements of marginalized people. Litigators developed an argument that the label of mental retardation is a stigma that deprives individuals of their liberty; therefore, the right to due process applies before the label can be assigned.¹ To build this argument, the critics of labeling drew on a theory developed by sociologists and shifted the focus from the deviant person to the process by which<br>

  Book Title: Outlaw Rhetoric-Figuring Vernacular Eloquence in Shakespeare's England<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mann Jenny C.<br>
  Abstract: Outlaw Rhetoricexamines the substantial and largely unexplored archive of vernacular rhetorical guides produced in England between 1500 and 1700. Writers of these guides drew on classical training as they translated Greek and Latin figures of speech into an everyday English that could serve the ends of literary and national invention. In the process, however, they confronted aspects of rhetoric that run counter to its civilizing impulse. For instance, Mann finds repeated references to Robin Hood, indicating an ongoing concern that vernacular rhetoric is "outlaw" to the classical tradition because it is common, popular, and ephemeral. As this book shows, however, such allusions hint at a growing acceptance of the nonclassical along with a new esteem for literary production that can be identified as native to England. Working across a range of genres, Mann demonstrates the effects of this tension between classical rhetoric and English outlawry in works by Spenser, Shakespeare, Sidney, Jonson, and Cavendish. In so doing she reveals the political stakes of the vernacular rhetorical project in the age of Shakespeare.<br>

Ecocriticism’s rapid theorization has allowed the field to move beyond the political activism that characterized its origins, and now offers an opportunity to begin academic study of the fictional environments in neomedievalisms.² Consequently, this essay<br>

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world.

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century.

  Book Title: Medievalist Enlightenment-From Charles Perrault to Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: Literary medievalism played a vital role in the construction of the French Enlightenment. Starting with the Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns, it influenced movements leading to the Romantic rediscovery of the Middle Ages, and helped to shape new literary genres, from the epistolary novel to the fairy tale and opera. Indeed, the dominant mode of the early Enlightenment, 'galanterie', was of medievalist inspiration. Moreover, the academic study of medieval texts underlay modern ideals of scholarship, institutionalized at the royal academies. The Middle Ages polemically functioned as an alternative site, allowing authors to rethink their age's political and social ideologies. At the centre of these debates was the notion of historical progress. Was progress possible, as the 'philosophes' held, or was human history a process of degeneration, with the Middle Ages as a lost Golden Age? From the re-evaluation of the medieval thus emerged not only the seeds of a new poetics, but also the central questions that preoccupied Enlightenment thinkers from Montesquieu to Rousseau. This book shows how, in order to understand the aesthetic and intellectual transformations that marked modernity, it is essential to examine how this period conceived of the past, and particularly those "Dark Ages" that served as the defining foil for the modern Age of Light.

  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them.

  Author(s) Bale Anthony<br>
  Abstract: An increasing emphasis on the otherness of the Jews in twelfth- and thirteenth-century ecclesiastical sources seems to coincide with a revival of the study of Hebrew among Christian scholars. While this revival, which forms part of a wider intensification of interest in language, rhetoric and the study of the biblical text, is visible all over Western Europe, scholars and texts of English origin are particularly well-represented in the extant source material.¹ This chapter focuses on the learning process involved in this type of cross-religious language acquisition. Examining Hebrew and Hebraist texts from pre-expulsion England, it aims to reconstruct, in so<br>

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship. Silvio J. dos Santos is assistant professor of musicology at the University of Florida.<br>

Perhaps the most significant aspect of this ending is that Berg places Lulu’s death offstage; the only victim onstage, and therefore seen and heard by the audience, is Geschwitz. Berg even considered, at some point during the compositional process, leaving Lulu alive, making Geschwitz the only fatal victim of Jack the Ripper.¹ This subtle<br>

The exploratory nature of Plato’s writings, as well as their apparent inconsistencies, are well documented.¹ His contradictory attitude, for instance, to poetry’s relationship to the polity has not only dogged disciplinary discourse in terms of a centuries-long quarrel between philosophy and literature, but has also given rise to a provocative paradigm that connects order within the self to the construction of a utopian state.

The production and reception of a national Canadian literature gained significant impetus during the 1960s and 1970s. The process of maturity for Canadian literature was greatly influenced by the cultural atmosphere surrounding the centenary of the Canadian Confederation in 1967, but the process itself had begun much earlier, as is indicated by the active support for Canadian literature by the Canada Council for the Arts from the late 1950s onwards.

Like Thomas, Marlatt disrupts surface structures to defamiliarize accepted notions of femininity and to question the coherence and continuity of gender and sexual identity.

Ends, means, and resources are caught up in an interdependent feedback process.”
                  12What is significant is Turner’s insistence that social dramas are not merely a representation (oral or written) of discord or conflict in society, and as such only a story with its “discernible inaugural, transitional, and terminal motifs” to use Hayden White’s terminology.13For<br>

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

  Abstract: Remembering Communism examines the formation and transformation of the memory of communism in the post-communist period. The majority of the articles focus on memory practices in the post-Stalinist era in Bulgaria and Romania, with occasional references to the cases of Poland and the GDR. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, including history, anthropology, cultural studies and sociology, the volume examines the mechanisms and processes that influence, determine and mint the private and public memory of communism in the post-1989 era. The common denominator to all essays is the emphasis on the process of remembering in the present, and the modalities by means of which the present perspective shapes processes of remembering, including practices of commemoration and representation of the past.<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

Abstract: This article aims (1) to analytically disaggregate agency into its several component elements (though these are interrelated empirically), (2) to demonstrate the ways in which these agentic dimensions interpenetrate with forms of structure, and (3) to point out the implications of such a conception of agency for empirical research. The authors conceptualize agency as a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past (in its “iterational” or habitual aspect) but also oriented toward the future (as a “projective” capacity to imagine alternative possibilities) and toward the present (as a “practical‐evaluative” capacity to contextualize past habits and future projects within the contingencies of the moment).<br>

Abstract: “On ne se détache pas du merveilleux, quand une fois on lui a donné sa créance, et pendant longtemps on s’acharne à rationaliser la merveille plutôt qu’à la réduire.”
         122Gaston Bachelard’s astute observation on the difficulty of dissolving wonder may sum up the history of attempts at naturalizing the resurrection. Yet the raising of the dead is a special case. It may be, if it ever happens, the wonder of wonders, but it also stands apart from the natural and preternatural marvels the Enlightenment sought to discredit and domesticate.123The criteria of testimony used to judge miracles or extraordinary phenomena can apply only indirectly to an event supposed to be outside time and space and one supposed to signal the end of nature and the universe. Although the intrinsic plausibility of resurrection could be questioned, belief in its probability or certainty did not count as the superstitious or “enthusiastic” product of a diseased imagination. The Enlightenment contributed to make the miraculous less prominent in theology and faith and to leave it behind as a silent and unsettled question on the edges of culture, ignored, like marvels, rather than debunked. In the process, the body was lost.<br>

Abstract: Important insights into group style come from the focus on group identity in social identity theories (Tajfel
            1982; Farr and Moscovici1984; Hewitt1989; Jenkins1996; see also McCall and Simmons1978; Melucci1988) and the “symbolic boundary” perspective (Lamont1999,1992; Lamont and Fournier1992; Lamont and Thevenot2000). These approaches alerted us at the outset to the fact that groups draw boundaries that identify “people like us,” and exclude others as different, or less worthy, in the process. For instance, upper‐middle‐class people draw socioeconomic, cultural, and moral boundaries between themselves and other groups (Lamont1992); people develop musical preferences by contrasting themselves with others who have different preferences (Bryson1996); moral entrepreneurs enforce boundaries between art and “obscenity” with specific social groups, not just society in general, in mind (Beisel1997). People imagine their tangible, face‐to‐face group on a broader, less tangible social map. This “mapping” is one of the three dimensions of group style—the “group boundaries” dimension—introduced at the start and illustrated in our cases. And as Lamont argues (1992), a group’s social map has many overlapping kinds of distinctions, not just class distinctions.<br>

Abstract: The third paradigm, while it deepens and widens the range of cultural and social events under investigation, at times risks abandoning detailed linguistic analysis in favor of discourse and rhetorical study as sufficient to uncover the politics of language use. In this way, it seems, each new paradigm rejects the previous one in order to highlight its new ideas. We would argue that, while the notion of paradigm is useful in revealing historical continuities and discontinuities, Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. As a consequence, it is easier to see the existence of paradigms in past work, from the position of an heir to and archivist of a tradition, than in the process of creation of new work. Duranti himself points out, sometimes with apparent surprise, that much of the work that he considers important overlaps the paradigms, especially the second and third. He is aware that in the third it is precisely the carryover of the detailed work on language in use that is becoming deepened by the new work on the relationships of language and institutional structuring, with the study of linguistic ideologies and language socialization.<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: The God‐term in Luhmann’s universe is “autopoesis,” essentially the self‐direction of the systems of society, including that of art, toward greater autonomy and complexity. Although Luhmann was a student of Talcott Parsons and his work bears the evolutionary interest of the functionalist paradigm, it is what many partisans of the older version might consider to be a mutant functionalism. As Luhmann avers, he considers “system differentiation” as “the heart of Parsons’s theory” (p. 350, n. 4) yet unlike Parsons’s optimistic sense that differentiation was undergirded by functional imperatives such as adaptive upgrading, Luhmann’s own sense is that the process of societal evolution “does not presuppose central norms, no matter how generalized” (p. 2). Essentially what this means is that society is composed of a set of systems (economy, politics, law, and art, among others) that evolve and complexify but not toward any unified state, such as Parsons’s “societal community.” Rather, each system tends toward its own independence and standards, and thus much of Luhmann’s book explores what he calls “the autonomy of art,” that is, the ability of the art system to develop its own “self‐description.”<br>

Abstract: This argument is found explicitly formalized in this manner by Gregory of Nyssa, among other authors:
         
               Knowing man thus requires referring him to God the incomprehensible and thus by derivation to grounding incomprehensibility in the incomprehensible, by virtue of man’s being its image and likeness. Augustine, too, comes to this conclusion: whereas Saint Paul, for his part, writes that no one “among men knows the secrets of man except the spirit of man which is in him” (1 Cor. 2:11) and thus assumed that man comprehends the secrets of man, Augustine does not hesitate to write on the contrary that “tamen est aliquid hominis, quod nec ipse scit spiritus hominis, qui in ipso est, tu autem. Domine, scis ejus omnia, quia eum fecisti” (“yet there is something of the human person which is unknown even to the ‘spirit of man which is in him.’ But you, Lord, know everything about the human person; for you made humanity”). Beginning from this unknowing of myself, who is nevertheless known by another—God alone—it is necessary to make use of the process ofThe icon is properly an icon so long as it fails in none of those attributes which we perceive in the archetype … therefore, since one of the attributes we contemplate in the Divine nature is incomprehensibility of essence (τὸ 'ακατάληπτον τῆς οὐσίας), it is clearly necessary that in this point the icon should be able to show its imitation of the archetype. For if, while the archetype transcends comprehension, the nature of the icon were comprehended, the contrary character of the attributes we behold in them would prove the defect of the icon; but since the nature of our mind, which is according to the icon of the Creator (τῷ κατ' εἰκόνα του κτίσαντος), evades our knowledge, it keeps an accurate resemblance to the superior nature, retaining the imprint of the incomprehensible [fixed] by the unknown within it (τῷ καθ` ἑαυτόν 'αγνώστῳ).

Abstract: Beginning in the early 1960s, and punctuated by Foucault’s 1966
         Les mots et les choses(The Order of Things) and his 1969L’archéologie du savoir(The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language), poststructuralist critiques of truth claims and the imperialism of global history, a rethinking of the certainty of words and concepts in an “archeology (that is, a deconstruction) of the social sciences” struck at the heart of long‐standingAnnalisteprinciples.91Whether studying social control, discipline, power, or sexuality, old assumptions were dissected and new agendas initiated. The 1976Il formaggio e i vermi(The Cheese and the Worms) by Carlo Ginzburg and the 1979 launching ofmicrostoriaby Ginzburg, Carlo Poni, and Edoardo Grendi—practiced in France by Le Roy Ladurie in his 1975Montaillouand 1979Carnival in Romans—fostered a new kind of ethnographic history of everyday life that focused on the individual.92“The revival of narrative,” whether from Lawrence Stone’s famous 1979Past and Presentarticle or Paul Ricoeur’s 1983–85Time and Narrative,was to restore the story to history and to return to the event, as Pierre Nora had called for in his 1974 essay inFaire de l’histoire.
            93Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979La distinctionpushed for a reconciliation between events and structure.94By emphasizing that systems of oppositions are not stable structures but are constantly in the process of becoming, being made and remade, Bourdieu’s project to understand how social reality is constructed gets us closer to incorporating practice and perception with objective categories and suggests a way of bridging the gap between the endless details of one thing after another and causal explanation. This list of keyAnnalisteideas and methods derived from theMéditerranée’s problematic could include sharp criticism like that of François Dosse; the constructive response of Jacques Revel on theAnnalesparadigms, the social sciences, and the construction of the social; Pierre N~<br>

Abstract: Looking back on the critique of rhetoric that emerged in early modernity, it is evident that it was just the motive of persuasion that came to be suspect. In a prescient hypothesis about the significance of this development, Wilbur Samuel Howell argues in his history of British rhetoric that the originality of Adam Smith’s
         Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettresconsisted in his “position that the new rhetoric must define its function as broadly communicative rather than narrowly persuasive.”32At last, a theory of communication! To communicate, in whatever genre of speech or writing, means that Itransmitmy thoughts or sentiments to you with minimal loss (or, as we say now, noise).33To persuade does not require that you know my thoughts or sentiments at all, only that you believe what I want you to believe or feel what I want you to feel. It is on the basis of this distinction that rhetoric was indicted, as a corruption of the communicative function, which was in a real sensediscoveredin the very process of formulating the critique.<br>

Abstract: By affirming the constructive aspect of comparison and its heuristic value, comparative theology avoids falling into the trap of casting an imaginatively constructed link as a natural or historical connection in a vain effort to lend “scientific” legitimacy to the former.
         51Thus disencumbered of the scientific prejudice that would tempt us into assuming a preexisting, objective foundation for every illuminating parallel, comparative theology is not committed to any dubious assumptions regarding a culturally independent experience of reality allegedly shared by the world’s faiths in order to justify its comparisons. Nor is its field of application restricted to those traditions for which there are established historical links.52Far from constituting a metalevel of discourse that simply records and analyzes past historical encounters, comparative theology itself represents a constitutive moment in an ongoing process of cross‐cultural transformation. Whether the imaginatively forged links of comparative theology overcome their arbitrary character and attain historical reality depends on whether they are supported by larger, historical forces through which the compared cultures effectively encounter each other. Without this support, these tenuous, imaginative links remain historically inert, confined to the mind of the scholar.53With it, they function performatively in the context of an effective encounter in the course of which the insights of one tradition become a constitutive part of another.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: In
         Bodies That Matter(1993), a book that begins, significantly, with an epigraph from Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1991), Butler begins to ponder the problems of the analogical model, although race is arguably still added to arguments about gender and sexuality. The bulk of the introduction theorizes the constructedness of “sex” and interrogates the critical assumption of a prior, unmarked category of sex onto which gender is culturally imposed. Instead of constructedness, Butler proposes the notion of matter, a process that “produce[s]the effect of boundary, fixity, and surface we call matter” (1993, 9). Sex and the contours of the body, Butler argues, are regulated by the heterosexual imperative. It is only much later in the introduction, after the theorizations of the body, sex, and matter have been made, that Butler introduces, as part of her chapter summaries, the idea that “normative heterosexuality is clearly not the only regulatory regime in the production of bodily contours” (1993, 17). Structurally, that is, body, sex, and matter are constituted as the main items of theory to which race is added. As Butler argues, race is not simply another domain separable from sexual difference, “but … its ‘addition’ subverts the monolithic workings of the heterosexual imperative as I have described it so far” (18). Although Butler is clearly aware of the problems of simply adding race to the understandings of the body and of sex, her own positioning of race in the introduction is nonetheless additive. Yet Butler goes on to suggest a focus on the specificities as well as intersections of race and gender construction: “It seems crucial to resist the model of power that would set up racism and homophobia and misogyny as parallel or analogical relations. The assertion of their abstract or structural equivalence not only misses the specific history of their construction and elaboration, but also delays the important work of thinking through the ways in which thes~<br>

Abstract: See Homi K. Bhabha,
            Location of Culture(London and New York: Routledge, 1994). Following in Fanon’s footsteps, he provides a pertinent analysis of how the identity‐shaping recognitive process within the concrete historical conditions of colonialism and its postcolonial aftermath has worked to suppress the play of difference within each cultural identity. Part of the strategy of colonial rule and ideological justification for the European colonizers, he points out, was always to construct rules and standards of recognition around the notions of “modernity,” “rationality,” and “progress” and to produce a totalizing and hierarchically structured binary opposition between the colonizers and the colonized by recognizing the full presence of modernity and rationality in the former while assigning to the latter their complete absence or merely partial presence. The colonizing Europe accomplished this by disavowing the presence of heterogeneity within itself, such as the feminine and the irrational, and symbolically constructing and representing the colonized cultures as the essentialized Other of its now homogeneous rational self (and civilized, muscular Christianity)—e.g., the bestially sexual Africans, the duplicitous Chinese, and the effeminate and degenerate Hindus. But the artificial construction of such a binary opposition is inherently unstable, Bhabha argues, as can be seen for instance from the self‐contradictory nature of the colonizers’ attempt to convert the subject population to Christianity and to create a class of colonial elites educated in the ways of Europe, which was tantamount to an implicit recognition of the capacity of the colonized for rationality and self‐government, while at the same time deprecating and deriding that recognized presence of the “civilized” qualities in them as mere mimicry or even mockery of the authentic European, Christian identity. According to Bhabha, it is precisely the practice of mimicry on the part of the colon~<br>

Abstract: Ultimately, Frei’s analysis leads to the conclusion that understanding the grammar of the text in terms of its historical linguistic context—in other words, with reference to the culture outside the text itself—divorces the meaning or subject matter of the text from the narrative cohesion of scripture, such that a practice that finds “meaning” in the ascriptive, figural resonances between passages fades from view. “Where hermeneutics and interpretation are governed by the conviction that the interpreter’s unique stance and process of understanding are face to face with that same motion within the discourse to be interpreted, and that this affinity alone (apart from the `linguistic stock’) is the ground for understanding what is being said, such ‘surface’ reading, finding character and society firmly related—a reading, moreover, which discovers the continuity of the narrative in its very contingency—must be viewed as superficial or worse.”
         39In the conclusion toEclipse, Frei suggests that if one divorces grammatical interpretation from its psychological cohort, it may serve as a more appropriate interpretive approach for recovering a narrative sense: “If they are not [united], it still does not necessarily follow that grammatical interpretation can do justice to the obviously narrative features of such realistic texts as the biblical stories. But it does follow that of these two it alone is a candidate, since it alone is concerned with verbal connections.”40<br>

Abstract: When interviewed a few days later, one of the students in the class echoed Mrs. Barrett’s inclusive attitude. Not only should the attackers be prayed for, Reba explained, but they should be forgiven. Reba was in the process of describing what moral lessons ought to be drawn from catastrophes when she explained, “Just ‘cause some Arab or Palestinian did this, it doesn’t mean we should hate all Arabians.” Reba seemed to think that the point of the lesson was to teach kids not to stereotype. Illuminating the message “how you shouldn’t hate,” she enlarged her point: “My mom’s 100 percent German, so I don’t hate the Germans even though what they did to the Jews. I think you have to forgive them just like you need to forgive the people who bombed the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon.” It is not clear to me from the interview with Reba whether she considered Holocaust atrocities to be similar to the attacks on September 11; it could well be simply the timing involved—the coincidence of studying the Holocaust on September 11—that provoked Reba’s comparison. Regardless, the New Testament’s injunction to “love enemies” provided the conceptualizing framework for this student’s and teacher’s initial response to the attacks on 9/11.<br>

Abstract: Thus the process of judgment entails, in the first stage, a participant self‐perspective and other perspective, in the second an observer perspective, and in the third a dual perspective exchange—one between the participant self‐perspective and other perspective and one between the participant and observer perspectives. This vividly illustrates the importance of maintaining a distinction between the two sets of paired contrasts. As noted already, the observer and participant perspectives fall in the sociospatial category of distance and proximity, while the two participant perspectives, self‐perspective and other perspective, fall under interpersonal dialogue aimed at interpersonal participation.<br>

Abstract: To follow up on Koselleck, the centerpiece of the memory process is not the material object. The structure of King Mausolus at Halicarnassus has perished but its name has not, and many of us carry memories of its imagined reconstructed appearance from art and history textbooks. Examples can be added ad infinitum, but the objection rests not only on analogies. In contemporary work on memory, significant attention is also paid to the role of imagery. Until about a century ago, the dogma was that “memory is a present image within which one must discern pastness and valid indications of the past.” Philosophers like Wittgenstein, Ryle, and J. L. Austin demonstrated, however, that remembering has little to do with imagery: “The recall may leave us with images; images of the past need not have provided the recall.”

Abstract: A similar poetic reading of the Genesis 2–3 story of Adam and Eve helps us relate this command for original creativity to original sin. When read as an eternal pattern for the human moral order, this story has of course been used for millennia to uphold deep structures of gender oppression. But read poetically, the sexual difference instead mythologizes human moral tension in its profound creative ambiguity. Adam and Eve’s fall is precisely into “shame” at their generative difference. In hiding their “reproductive” capabilities from one another, humankind in the process hides (in the bushes) from its own very Creator. Human relations lose their dynamic tensionality and crouch in silent stasis.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The problem that Ricoeur relentlessly puts forth in his final chapter is that of the asymmetry of agents in the process of recognition. Like the making of a promise, one party is in debt, while the other is in demand. And contrary to appearances, neither the act of recognizing nor the act of promising end once the demand or the promise is fulfilled. Ricoeur insists on the moral motivations that bring together the recognizing and the recognized party. At the end of the book, these moral motivations are analyzed under the triple heading of states of peace, gift exchange, and mutual recognition. Here, recognition takes the form of “gratitude,” as exemplified by festive undertakings of recognition. The virtues of giving and of receiving are real, and they express, in the eyes of Ricoeur, the limits of an always asymmetrical recognition bounded by peace and gratitude.<br>

Abstract: A genuine atmosphere of deliberation requires three principles: “The basic premise of reciprocity is that citizens owe one another justifications for the institutions, laws, and public policies that collectively bind them. … Together with reciprocity, two other principles specify the conditions of democratic deliberation. The principle of publicity requires that reason‐giving be public in order that it may be mutually justifiable. The principle of accountability specifies that officials who make decisions on behalf of other people, whether or not they are electoral constituents, should be accountable to those people” [
      34, pp. 133, 135]. Within the framework of rights (encompassing justice as fairness) and the process of deliberation according to a discourse ethical approach, librarianship can be better able to address the difficult issues it faces. The reality of pluralism necessitates both rights and deliberation. Deliberation, as a process, cannot help but be dialectical. As has been shown here, there are differing conceptions of right and good, of intellectual freedom and censorship, even of ethical theories. To at least some extent, the discussion and controversy surrounding these issues are antinomies, contradictions between statements that each has reasonable grounds. Dialectics, as a means of resolving contradictions and reconciling division, has its foundations in Hegel. Steven Smith ably summarizes the key elements of a dialectical approach:
               It is by such an approach that we, as a profession, can arrive at a fully formed practical and normative ethics. It would be fruitless to ignore the divisions and disagreements; they must be addressed dialogically. Further, the dialogue is inescapably phenomenological (as described above) in that legitimacy, which includes beliefs and voice, must be assumed by all, with regard to all. The foregoing is an attempt to further the dialogue.Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. ~<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Omissions are plentiful in these accounts: the selection of a field, the routines of teaching, squabbles with colleagues, rivalries, ambition and desire for recognition. Exceptions surface here too—women who discuss gender bias in their profession, authors from the working class who struggle to adapt to the academic world—but most authors keep mute on the same questions. Popkin offers several explanations for these silences, ranging from shame to fear of colleagues’ reactions to narrative concerns (tedium, lack of drama). The most significant and fascinating factor, however, is that these authors write autobiographies as, first and foremost, members of a profession. They free themselves, it is true, from this profession’s norm of self‐effacement by expressing their individuality and discussing private matters. But they do not shed their disciplinary identity in the process. On the contrary, their autobiographies sustain the profession’s norms and values. They minimize conflicts, belittle individual achievements (in the classroom, for instance), and omit mention of aspirations that question the ideal of fraternal, disinterested scholars who live a pure life of the mind. This is true of other disciplines as well, but history, reliant as it is on cumulative, collective scholarship, finds it especially difficult to celebrate individual achievement. Autobiography, this most personal of genres, hence services collective authority, professional community, and an ostensible containment of the self.<br>

Abstract: The current return to a historical present teeming with competing temporalities from the past recalls both repetitions from other times and places and what perceiving them meant for social theory. Specifically, this recognition refers to those attempts envisaged by people like Tosaka and Maurice Halbwachs before World War II who sought to account for the spectacle of mixed temporalities in the present. Both, it is important to acknowledge, discounted the veracity of history’s claims to a true time and proposed conceptions of temporality they believed to be emanating from the historical process itself (as they conceived it). The consequence of Halbwachs’s and Tosaka’s interventions was to deprivilege state archives and thus shifted the order of the Hegelian allegory symbolizing the conflict between Chronos, the god of Time, and Zeus, the god of politics who created state and hearth. In this struggle, Chronos, who inevitably devours his own, engulfing all in his passage, is ultimately dominated by Zeus, who creates the state, which in turn conquers time. Just as important is the state’s capacity to transform in history all that Mnemosyne—the goddess of memory—had been able to collect after the rampaging passage of time.
         25It is also worth mentioning that while Halbwachs codified the separation of history from memory and upheld the claims of the latter over the former (that is to say, the claims of time over space) the effort to rematerialize time—yet retain its qualitative character—by freeing it from an interiorized, psychological consciousness was not attempted in Europe or America, but Japan. Tosaka’s critique of what he called “borrowed time,”26referring to history’s reliance on conceptions of time from other disciplines—the physical sciences, but especially the inner time consciousness of phenomenology and even mythology—and his identification of the everyday (especially as lived by the worker) revealed the real source of historical time, the “mystery of~<br>

Article Title: Two Apologetic Moments in Śaṅkara’s Concept of Brahman<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: In this article I hope to show that an appreciation of the commentarial and apologetic dimensions of Śaṅkara’s
      Bhāṣyais essential to a proper understanding of the Advaita concept of brahman. Here I follow the lead of Francis Clooney, who warns against the temptation to reduce the teaching of Advaita to an easily accessible set of conclusions or propositions.10A set of propositions cannot be abstracted from the exegetical practices and apologetic strategies from which they emerge without suffering a loss of meaning. Advaita doctrine is properly understood only when it is seen as the outcome of a careful negotiation of meaning with authoritative texts and competing interpretations of those texts. In keeping with Clooney’s insistence on the “intratextual” nature of Advaita doctrine, I would like to suggest that we view the concept of brahman, particularly with reference to its transcendental character, as generated out of the tension among the multiple voices that constitute the Advaita “Text.”11Here I find it helpful to relate the development of the Advaitic concept of brahman as recorded in the stratified text of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyato the metaphorical process by which the transcendent concept of God is constructed through the “qualification” (Ian Ramsey) of a basic conceptual model.12The concept of brahman is gradually built up from the successive qualifications the founding teachers of Vedānta impart to the conceptual models they inherit from the brahmanical tradition. These qualifications, moreover, typically are apologetically motivated. The reception of traditional teachings occurs in a polemical context in which the meaning of those teachings is inflected by contemporary apologetic concerns. In the pages that follow, I shall identify two such apologetic “moments” in the development of the concept of brahman as it is found in the text of Śaṅkara’sBhāṣya.<br>

Abstract: Rewritings of texts that are still under copyright illuminate this process. First published in Italian in 1995 and subsequently issued in a Dutch translation in 1996, Pera’s rewriting of
         Lolitafrom the eponymous character’s perspective was blocked from publication in the United States by Vladimir Nabokov’s son, Dmitri, who claimed copyright infringement. The case was settled with Dmitri Nabokov writing a preface to the novel and half of Pera’s royalties going to PEN (Poets, Playwrights, Essayists, and Novelists).13According to Nabokov, Pera is trading on the celebrity ofLolita, “seek[ing] inspiration, fortune and fame” from his father’s world‐famous novel. Taking Pera’s lawyer up on his argument thatLo’s Diaryis a “transformative” work, Nabokov observes: “My Fair Lady,West Side Story, Stoppard’sRosencrantz and Guildenstern, Updike’sS, Jean Rhys’sWide Sargasso Sea… all had been safely tucked into the public domain when the ‘transformations’ were penned.Lolitaisn’t in the public domain, and won’t be until well into the next millennium when its copyright expires” (Nabokov1999, viii). The distinction, no doubt, is important; texts under copyright require dues to be paid, and their authors or estates can file suit to see their rights honored. Yet in their attempts to keep unauthorized rewritings at bay, they reveal a mechanism that is inherent to all rewriting, the effects of which are of the order of brand recognition.<br>

Abstract: Radford [
            7] also considered the issue of truth in librarianship by using the work of Foucault [34] to explore how truth‐seeking behaviors in the library are representative of a broader process of creating new knowledge beyond the content of individual texts. Radford examined the modern research library environment by considering the representative relationship between the library as place and contemporary views of knowledge. One view sees the librarian as operating in a world of “individual facts.” In this construct, the librarian acts as both the guardian and broker of information as commodity. The other interpretation is borrowed from Umberto Eco’s novel,The Name of the Rose. In this work, according to Radford, the librarian is portrayed as a “quasi‐mystical guardian of a great temple of knowledge” [7, p. 409]. Radford argues that these conceptions of the library are grounded in a positivist view of knowledge, where knowledge as text can be archived, classified, and arranged in a logical manner and the purpose of the librarian is to preserve and protect the text as the receptacle of knowledge.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: In conjuring up the conceptual field of such effects, we might turn to set theory and picture a Venn diagram by which narratography is defined as exactly the zone of overlap between narratology and stylistics. Narratography would be shaded in there by the very shadings and incremental gradations of prose in the thick and thin of its own action as linguistic incident. Here emerges, in sum, the heuristic value of a so-called
         Story Left Behindin staging by exaggeration the everyday wake of narrativity in verbal process. Any narrative sentence may have its dramatic prehistory. It need not necessarily be distended or suddenly truncated, not by definition brutal or suppressed or moving or any one thing in particular, and not necessarily longer than the plotted tension of the preceding paragraph or even sentence. But narrative prehistory is manifest as a forward pressure nonetheless. That's why this essay's approach is in fact “narratival” rather than strictly stylistic (whatever that might mean)—and often dialectical as such. And why its instinct for intensive reading comes into sync with the impetus of plotted structure rather than just local representation. And why, further, even in imagining an entire shadow plot, the inflated exception developed in the fictional phase of this essay can still prove the rule of the minuscule. Whole lives, of course, don't usually lie battered, absented, and returned by deformation under the tread of suchfrictionin prose. Broad swaths of plot aside, it is rather in the immediate pace of reading that some aspect or facet of an advancing story is often bent noticeably out of shape. Narratography becomes, in this sense, the tracking of syntax and of the words it marshals for the impinging microplots, one after the other, of their own proximate backstories.<br>

Abstract: In the episode of his grandmother’s dream, for example, the theory of involuntary memory is grafted onto the theory of dreams developed especially in
         Le Côté de GuermantesI and inÀ l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleursII. In sleep Marcel’smoi“dies” and then, upon awakening, finds itself slightly modified by its dreams. Marcel recognizes himself by self‐recollection, yet it is a partially different self that he “remembers again,” when his memory “resurrects” it after the self‐forgetfulness of sleep. At first the “immersion” into a “leaden sleep” entails for Marcel a state, close to death, of radical absence from himself: “the attack of mental derangement that we call sleep” provokes in him a condition of complete self‐amnesia. In turn, this self‐amnesia gives him access to “the dark walls of that chamber which opens up on our dreams,” wherein “the drive to forget amorous sorrows works away incessantly.” Finally, thanks to his intrusion into this realm of constantly eroded remembrance, Marcel may disable the process of oneiric deterioration; he brings away with him “memories of dreams” that, although “shrouded in shadows” by the drive to forget, will become recognizable to him when the coincidence of some similar occurrence in the daytime will “strike them like a ray of light.” It is at the epiphanic stage of this “fortuitous” coming together of oneiric relic and present impression that the work of involuntary memory coalesces with the work of dreams. In the specific case of his grandmother’s dream, Marcel’smoi, after the deliberate rarefaction obtained in sleep, is resurrected as the self that used to exist in a condition of mutual cohesion with the soul of his grandmother.62<br>

Abstract: In modern democracies, the
         ars memoriaehave been placed in the hands of the people, dispersed across various roles, ceremonies, institutions, and commemorative practices.85Understood self‐reflexively, just‐war morality can work in such contexts to ensure that war is remembered for the right reasons or, put more accurately, that what is remembered about war is right. In that way citizens can assess war and public history with habits and norms that enable us to resist the twin perils of self‐aggrandizement and self‐deception. That is no small need given how memories of past wars shape how subsequent wars are conceived, authorized, and fought. Viewed as an exercise of ascesis, just‐war morality can discipline passions and actions that risk imposing on fellow citizens and others the ultimate sacrifice. In the process, it enables us to address Anscombe’s anxious premonition: “The death of men, the curtailment of liberty, the destruction of property, the diminution of culture, the obscuring of judgment by passion and interest, the neglect of truth and charity, the decrease in belief and in the practice of religion—all these are the normal accompaniments of a war.”86<br>

Abstract: The tether to the vertical pole of theory having loosened in the 1980s, film studies spread out from its traditional center. Deleuze's and Bordwell's books may stand out from that era because their ideas took shape in and around a longstanding corpus—the art film and classical Hollywood—but that corpus was on the verge of exploding under the pressure of cultural studies. For anglophone film studies in that decade dove straight into this rising river, trying not to drown in the process. Not only were new modes and genres dredged up for discussion, films themselves were increasingly set aside in favor of other objects of study (audiences, television, advertising).
         59As for cinema studies, it has lost much of the vague definition it had, yet as an institution, a “society,” it swelled with new types of scholars, many of whom found movies and related phenomena to be a fine—even an exceptional—site to monitor social processes.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: The studies under review represent significant revisions to the narrative of secularization. Their point of departure, as this essay has argued, is Enlightenment-era reactions to the inaccessibility of a radically transcendent, hidden God. By investing temporal concepts and institutions with new meanings that approximated religion's function of legitimizing human existence, eighteenth-century philosophers and theologians made the imperatives of the temporal sphere as binding as divine hierarchies once had been. Of course, the operative elements of this process varied, depending on the monograph in question: for Bell and Sepinwall, it was the regeneration of the nation-state and its inhabitants; for Sutcliffe, it was the Enlightenment's efforts to transcend Judaism; for Sheehan, it was the translation and repackaging of Scripture; for Dupré, it was the human person's emergence as the fundamental source of meaning. Yet each of these scholars insists that religious culture had a decisive influence on the formation of “secular” ideals and institutions. Enlightenment and religion, so long regarded as antithetical to each other, are now viewed as overlapping and interdependent agents of historical change.<br>

Abstract: Aiding in this iconical reconfiguration were the microadjusting features of ritual performance. Procedures such as shaving, showering, praying, and blowing Quranic verses helped to heighten the register of the ritual event, and ultimately to instantiate an irreversible commitment to the end goal. Indeed, the entire ritual process might be seen as secondary to, or at least supportive of, the oath unto death in section 1. No differently than oaths in ancient war literature, the oath of the last instructions was a highly sanctified liturgical order that aimed to instantiate a commitment and to communicate binding intent.<br>

Abstract: The process of reading and interpreting the Talmud provided Lévinas with the appropriate medium through which he was able to name the essence of Judaism and to act as its spokesperson. The irony is that Lévinas is ultimately unable in his own interpretations to demonstrate the very principle that authorizes his engagement with the rabbinic corpus. While it is the fecundity of the text that accommodates untraditional meanings, his desire to disseminate a particular interpretation of Judaism disallows him from upholding the text's plurivocity.<br>

Abstract: Dante's use of the animal simile brings nonhuman and human creatures together, either as analogies, through the breakdown of sign and signified, or in a process whereby “the other”—in this case a nonhuman creature—is the “locus of transcendence” that actually “calls into question the
         Iin its existence as a being for itself,” as Levinas posits. For in Levinas's understanding of alterity and transcendence, the “I” paradoxically finds within itself “the other as such.”51This parallels what Badiou argues in “The Age of Poets.” In this poetic process, time collapses, as the eschatological future and the prelapsarian past exist in the eternal present of the actions of nonhuman creatures.<br>

Abstract: What is left, then, of memory's scope and power? one might ask. How to handle the flow of memory and oblivion, the lengthy stretches of desire, the postponement of fulfillment, of the “tomorrow, tomorrow” versus the instantaneous pressure of the present: “Why not now? Why not now an end to my impure life in this very hour?”?
      
            Only the verticality of oblivion:17
         
            Now, there is no denying that this text sounds utterly seducing, expressing longing and desire, falling short and finding fulfillment all at once. As such, it can be called representative of the pulse of the Augustinian language. Yet putting things this way would fail to do justice to the tight nature of

You were with me, and I was not with you. The lovely things kept me far from you, though if they did not have their existence in you, they had no existence at all. You called and cried out loud and shattered my deafness. You were radiant and resplendent, you put to flight my blindness. You were fragrant, and I drew in my breath and now pant after you. I tasted you, and I feel but hunger and thirst for you. You touched me, and I am set on fire to attain the peace which is yours.

Abstract: Although this account is promising, I see three problems or issues needing clarification in it. First, while insisting that their function is not cognitive, Larmore describes such avowals as “an exercise of practical reflection” (128). This suggests that it is by a kind of thought that someone deliberately commits herself or takes “responsibility for what she is doing” (63). It would be clearer to say that this is a process of will that sets new final ends or shores up motivation to follow intentions already formed. Luther may have performed an act of practical reflection in “expressing his resolution to pursue the path on which he had set out” (63), but the resolution in which he took his stand and set his personal policies was not itself constituted by the reflective expression of them. Larmore’s account misses what I have called the “projective motivation” function of willing that Ricoeur at least implicitly recognizes. He does such a good job of arguing that the constitutive self-relation is not a “cognitive” or knowledge-aimed relationship (131) that he does not draw key distinctions between different practical or “performative” operations of mind (134). However, perhaps the problem is simply that Larmore’s terminology reflects his aversion to any “acts of will” distinct from beliefs and desires, as we saw above. For, in arguing that the object of practical reflecting is “in no way cognitive,” he briefly distinguishes it from
      practical reasoningin which we “conclude that certain actions are obligatory, permissible, or prudent” (70). While practical reasoning is cognitive and aims at objective correctness in judgment, practical reflection instead aims at “an explicit intention to do this or that” (71)—which sounds like Aristotle’s concept ofprohairesis(usually translated as rational “choice”). Why not then recognize that such an intention-forming process normally mediates between belief-desire sets and the intentions that express them?<br>

Abstract: The “infection” model has been discussed above at length. It pertains to a select group of conditions which were associated with a fear of contagion. This fear element can account for the more complex purificatory process and the need for sacrificial offerings. As noted above, the manner of infection is modeled after the concrete expression of this Defilement (e.g., genital emission, odor).<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Csordas’s stress on the analysis of humanly commissioned evil as the route to understanding morality is justified. However, I also see it as modified by instances of human culpability being displaced onto nonhuman agents, thereafter regarded as responsible for the evil. Csordas cites Kapferer’s observation that, while Sinhalese regard sorcery as immoral, it is displaced onto demons (“supramundane agents”). But does such a process of displacement actually exonerate humans of their culpability, or is it another way of referring to human culpability within a wider sphere of alternating explanations, a kind of transposed or deferred moral blame? For instance, sickness or misfortune in many African communities may successively be attributed to spirits, impiety, broken prohibitions, ancestral negligence, and witches. That these many agents of alleged evil may alternate as explanations within a single case suggests a kind of equivalence between human and nonhuman agents, for example, spirits and witches standing in for each other. This further suggests that “our” notion of human culpability should be broadened to include its apparently nonhuman manifestations. We can see them all as a single human/transhuman discourse.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Hanford, whose edition I cite, clearly segregates the three intersecting voices through his use of double and single quotation marks. But do these marks adequately reflect what happens in this climactic scene? Stanley Fish describes it: “‘Tempt not the Lord thy God; he said.’ Who said? The Son, of course, since the sounds issue from his mouth, but the words are not his…except in the sense that he has identified himself with their speaker. It is not that he appropriates the words, but that they, and their source, appropriate him.”
         
               The great critical question about these two lines is whether, when Jesus says “Tempt not the Lord thy God,” he simply means the Father or whether he now understands his true identity and is essentially telling Satan, “don’t tempt me.”43
            
               Fish’s reading is helpful because it redirects the thorny theological questions of substance, essence, and consubstantiation to the simpler question of quotation. The Son is able to speak the words of the Father so selflessly that he merges with the divine source, becoming the Word of God. We might say that Jesus begins the sentence in quotation marks but that the Son concludes them in his own voice—just as Adam begins speaking the words of Satan only to discover that they are unfortunately his own. In both cases, Milton demands something beyond the powers of our everyday typographical equipment. What we need in such instances is a mark to signify diminishing quotation—the process whereby words attributed to another gradually become, in the act of enunciation, the speaker’s own. If44
            Paradise Lostillustrates how easily this may happen in the case of satanic speech,Paradise Regainedoffers the possibility that it can work in the opposite direction. When the Son speaks, the divisive quotes miraculously slip away as the human and the divine merge in the space of a single utterance. This is the nature of real union with God on the poem: you start qu~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Now, it has to be underscored that, unlike Bonhoeffer, Badiou talks about weakness not in a sense of a personal vulnerability that is an expression of the conformity to Christ through his cross but in the sense of the “formal” weakness of the Christian message. As Zerbe phrases it, in Badiou “evental truth declaration in the modality of weakness does not correspond to one of lived weakness.”
            
                  This results in consequent divergences between Bonhoeffer’s thought and his own. First of all, for Badiou the Christian subject is instituted not by solidarity with the world’s sufferings but through the subject’s own declaration of the event. This aspect of Badiou’s reflection points to the fundamental role of the act of declaration: “It is not the singularity of the subject that validates what the subject says; it is what he says that founds the singularity of the subject.”143
               
                  Paul himself became the subject of the Christian truth suddenly, on the road to Damascus, his “conversion” being the subjective sign of the event proper, that is, the resurrection of Christ. “Truth, event, subject, and fidelity are thus all part of a single process: truth comes into being via subjects who declare an event and, in so doing, are constituted (‘subjectivated’ Badiou likes to say) precisely by their faithful and continuous response to the irruption of that revolutionary event.”144

Date: 09 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Bosola’s figure is only one of the play’s many attempts to make sense out of seemingly senseless cruelty. The same world of suffering that leads to his image of the stars’ tennis match inspires a very different response from Antonio. In conversation with the Duchess, Antonio delivers one of the most notable of the play’s many “wise” statements: “Man (like to
      Cassia) is prov’d best, being bruiz’d” (3.5.71). In a precursor to Bradley’s meditations on the fragrance of a crushed flower, Antonio also responds to tragic events with an argument that our best selves are revealed through suffering, making pain a valuable experience and tragedy a process of identity formation. Antonio’s perspective, like Bradley’s, grows out of confrontation with a tragic world that appears destined to crush its inhabitants and through associations that find value in that process. But just as the play casts doubt on the ability of the senses to perceive reality, it also questions the capacity of metaphor to make sense of suffering. Webster’s strongest character, the Duchess, rejects Antonio’s philosophy—although even she cannot escape the metaphorical thinking ingrained in the world of the play. In response to Antonio, she produces two images of her own:
            Though she initially rejects Antonio’s philosophy outright, the Duchess reveals her own uncertainty about the nature and meaning of her suffering by introducing a second figurative interpretation. Her images inject the play with what could be seen as an optimistic view of divine involvement in human life, and she asserts her own ability to make “sense” of her pain through concepts developed out of her personal experience, not generalized

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak’s account of philosophy as conversation emphasizes a few key themes. First, he defends the view that the history of philosophy is an integral part of the practice of philosophy. A tradition in his account is a living conversation in which philosophical sources are not simply transmitted but transformed in the process. Speaking to his fellow Catholic philosophers, Peperzak at once defends the legitimacy of appeal to the historical traditions of communities for citizens of the “Republic of philosophy” (176) and insists that tradition cannot simply canonize past thinkers but must become part of the ongoing conversation of the present. Second, Peperzak emphasizes more than most philosophers the significance of philosophical style. For him, style is the particularization of philosophical tradition and thematics in lived conversations. It marks my individual way of offering my voice to a philosophical companion—a unique event, even if what is Said may repeat inherited propositions (90–91).<br>

Author(s): Eubanks Cecil<br>
Abstract: This theme of a postliberal order is explored in
         Eric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmoderns, which attempts to understand Voegelin as a postmodern thinker in search of a philosophical foundation but without foundationalism: to see whether a society can recover a sense of transcendence without resorting to metaphysical certainty (21). In “Voegelin and Ricoeur,” Peter Petrakis opens the book with the belief that such a recovery is possible. By showing how both thinkers believed that stories and symbols can serve as a foundation for politics and ethics, Petrakis demonstrates how both Voegelin and Rioecur can recover transcendence without returning to metaphysical certainty. Both Voegelin and Ricoeur cite a “unified self” who symbolizes or creates a narrative out of his experiences that can be verified both externally and internally. Critical to this understanding is that the “unified self” is one that respects the mystery of being and therefore does not attempt to place himself outside of reality to survey all of it: The self exists within a historical or linguistic process not of his own making and must accept it. By accepting this epistemologically limited position, the “unified self” protects himself against charges of metaphysical reductionism.<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: Anderson’s argument covers a lot of ground — from the works of Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne to the Vestiarian Controversy of the 1560s and the economic writings of Gerrard de Malynes — but she takes her first bearings from the twentieth-century theorists Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur. Derrida offers her an account of the persistence of the etymological trace, a theory of metaphor grounded in words. Ricoeur — from whom she also borrows a sense of metaphorical productivity as Hegelian sublation — describes the process of “lexicalization” through which a lively metaphor loses its polyvalence, governed by its role in particular sentences (and, by extension, in particular rhetorical and cultural contexts). The contest between surplus and lexicalization is this book’s subject, and Anderson teaches us how to measure the pressures in each direction. If she takes a side, it is Derrida’s, and her reasons are historical: the vernacular ferment of the period, its polylingualism, and the humanist grammarians’ emphasis on

Abstract: Analogy or proportion is when the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. We may then use the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth. Sometimes too we qualify the metaphor by adding the term to which the proper word is relative. Thus the cup is to Dionysus as the shield to Ares. The cup may, therefore, be called “the shield of Dionysus”, and the shield “the cup of Ares”. Or, again, as old age is to life, so is evening to day. Evening may therefore be called, “the old age of the day” and old age, “the evening of life”, or, in the phrase of Empedocles, “life’s setting sun”. For some of the terms of the proportion there is at times no word in existence; still the metaphor may be used. For instance, to scatter seed is called sowing: but the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed. Hence the expression of the poet “sowing the god-created light”. There is another way in which this kind of metaphor may be employed. We may apply an alien term, and then deny of that term one of its proper attributes; as if we were to call the shield, not “the cup of Ares” but “the wineless cup”. (

Abstract: The first chapter, “Spatiality,” addresses an age-old problem in the study of Chinese tombs. What factors caused the shift from the pre-Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) practice of burying the dead in wooden caskets set within deep vertical pits to the Han and post-Han preference for constructing chambered tombs positioned along a horizontal axis? Because in casket tombs the objects, not the architectonic space, give the tomb meaning, Wu reconceptualizes this transition as moving from an “object-oriented” to a “space-oriented” design, during which time tombs underwent a process of “architecturalization” (32). He attributes the shift to major changes in ancestral worship, conceptions of the soul and the afterlife, and the establishment of an underworld bureaucracy that occurred in or just before the Han. To this point, Wu informs us that whereas in pre-Han times immortality was equated with deathlessness, in the Han period immortality after death was believed possible. As a consequence, tombs were decorated with images of the home, the heavens, and the world of the immortals, thereby embodying “polycentric” spaces that offered the dead a rich variety of realms to inhabit (221).<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Article Title: The Apparatus of the Dark: Emily Dickinson and the Epistemology of Metaphor<br>
Publisher: The University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncl.2012.67.issue-1<br>
Date: 6 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Author(s): Newman Sara<br>
Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Abstract: Research on identity suggests that a critical factor in identity concerns presentation or the behaviors actors perform in order to convince others of their identity. Yet identity also involves the attributions others make on the basis of these behaviors. In this paper, I argue that all acts do not fare equally in the process of attribution. Rather, individuals making attributions engage in a process of mental weighing as a way to determine which acts “count” toward identity and to what extent. While various components of the act contribute to its social weight—its presence or absence, markedness, frequency, context, and the manner in which it is performed—the lens through which the attributer views the act also influences the weighing process.<br>

Article Title: Ways of Evaluating Teacher Cognition: Inferences concerning the Goldilocks Principle<br>
Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i249721<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Zumwalt Dona M.<br>
Abstract: Although research on teacher cognition is no longer in its infancy, it has largely failed to affect the ways in which programs and teachers are evaluated. In accordance with what Raths and Katz (1985) call the Goldilocks Principle, the notion of teacher cognition may simply be "too big" (too general and vague) for mundane application. This review was designed to compare alternative approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition and to consider ways in which the literature of this subfield may be discouraging its application. Teacher cognition is defined as pre- or inservice teachers' self-reflections; beliefs and knowledge about teaching, students, and content; and awareness of problem-solving strategies endemic to classroom teaching. This paper describes and critiques five different approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition: (a) direct and noninferential ways of assessing teacher belief, (b) methods that rely on contextual analyses of teachers' descriptive language, (c) taxonomies for assessing self-reflection and metacognition, (d) multimethod evaluations of pedagogical content knowledge and beliefs, and (e) concept mapping. In the final section, ambiguities and paradoxes inherent in this literature are discussed, particularly the continued use of rhetoric associated with process--product research. Questions regarding the ecological validity of measurement tools and tasks are raised. A suggestion is made that it may be politically exigent to begin relating measures of teacher cognition to valued student outcomes.<br>

Abstract: An assumed link between language and experience prompted the narrative collection and mutual interpretation of data between me and an immigrant from Iran whom I taught ESL. An underlying theme of the study was the quest for a helpful image of language. Realizing that dictionary meanings were inadequate in the meaning-making process, we concentrated on illustrative examples for the meaning of words. We exploited mininarratives implicit in such examples-incipient stories based on the speaker's past, present, and imaginatively projected experiences. As we expanded these "experiential narratives," the student's personal practical knowledge emerged and helped clarify troublesome words and sentences. Viewing language as experiential narrative demonstrated the importance of the context of acquisition. It increased opportunities for the negotiation of meaning and highlighted the notion of agency in the constitution of meanings.<br>

naire"(25).

marks redefinition, re-examination, as of the terms used in a long, complex process of rea-
soning. ... These characters are not, we might say, quite in the same play or on the same
stage or even quite all there" (41)

Abstract: Longterm trends are examined for the population mass that occupied the central highlands of Palestine during the Iron Age. After 1200 B. C. the landscape of this sparsely populated "frontier" changed as newcomers established hilltop villages, cultivated intermontane valleys, and terraced the slopes. Spatial patterning within villages and certain toponyms were influenced by patrilineal kinship. Heads of household and their lineage mates exercised rights over inheritance and succession in landholding. Inequalities developed within "tribal" Israel long before the monarchy, probably through a process of "lineage capture;" and clientship, with its dyadic relationships between superiors and inferiors, became more common. Tensions developed within Israelite society from the interactions of kinship, clientship, and kingship. As the population grew under the monarchy, the highland frontier was effectively closed, and opportunities for acquiring new land diminished. Thus, many unmarried males had to look elsewhere for patrons and positions. From the ranks of these noble "youths" came recruits for the military, the government, and the priesthood.<br>

Publisher: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, Inc.<br>
Issue: i262141<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Tyler Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
Issue: i262178<br>
Date: 2 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Bozdogan Samuel<br>
Abstract: The following essay considers Josep Lluis Sert's American Embassy in Baghdad (1955-1961) as an attempt to project a new basis for American political influence abroad that was compatible with a rapidly changing postcolonial world. Although the United States began its program of embassy construction to accord with its new role as a world power, the government required architects to be sensitive to local conditions of the site and the host country. In Iraq, this meant distinguishing America from both a rival Soviet Union and from England, America's ally but increasingly despised by Iraqis for its uninvited sway over their government, as well as addressing questions of climate and local construction capacities. To negotiate political complexities of the cold war and to balance American ambitions with local conditions, Sert drew on a modernism that was itself in the process of transition due in part to its application to a broader range of building types and social tasks, of which the embassy program is an instance, and in part to the representational pressures such institutional patronage entails.<br>

Issue: i263715<br>

Author(s): Windisch William A.<br>
Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Article Title: Toward an Ontology of Relativism<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263706<br>
Date: 12 1, 1951<br>
Author(s): Makemson Laurence L.<br>
Abstract: The principal purpose of this essay is to examine the theory of culture (and the role of symbols of the sacred in culture) which is presupposed in Ricoeur's Symbolism of Evil. The examination is motivated by the question whether or not the etiology of the symbolism of evil which Ricoeur offers in his important text will stand up to the demands imposed by cross-cultural applications. It is argued that Ricoeur's exposition invites an assumption of the cross-cultural validity of his schema. The process of examination comprises two major sections. First, a synopsis of Ricoeur's text is offered to establish a working understanding of the concepts which offer themselves as integral to any cross-cultural evaluation of the "symbolism of evil." Second, a "test-case" is defined: the religious symbolisms of Maya Indian culture. The definition of this test-case involves two secondary tasks: 1) a brief description of the general features of Maya religious symbolism; and, 2) an analysis of how Ricoeur's categories of the symbolism of evil fail to define accurately symbolisms of evil which occur in Maya mythology both before and after the conquest. This analysis leads finally to an assessment of the impact of western religious symbolisms on indigenous Maya symbolisms of evil. Ultimately, Ricoeur's analysis of the symbolism of evil is argued to be invalid for cross-cultural comparisons which extend beyond the cultural ambience of the western world.<br>

Article Title: Ideology and Alienation: Theses on the Interpretation and Evaluation of Theologies of Liberation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>
Date: 12 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Winter Charles R.<br>
Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have seldom avoided anecdotal data and included in their texts information about how they produce knowledge that they claim to be true. While considering fieldwork as the foundation of their discipline as well as their identity, they have removed this activity from analysis and overlooked its relationship with textualisation. This account of fieldwork in Quilombo Frechal (Maranhao, Brazil) purports to move from "participant observation to observation of participation" (Tedlock 1991), including in written texts the process of construction of anthropological knowledge. It attempts to represent the social reality of "Others" through an analysis of one's own experience in their world.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Abstract: The article describes and analyses the recruitment and training of young Zambians in the 1990s for Catholic religious Brotherhood. The consequences of the missionary employment of Euro-American concepts of personhood and self that involve particular understandings of narrative and the use of psychological testing are explored. The author argues that Zambian understandings of personhood and of individual experience of evil and suffering are silenced in the process of religious formation. This discussion raises salient issues about training for Catholic religious or priestly life in Africa because similar techniques have been commonly employed throughout the continent.<br>

Author(s): Wolf George Clement<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the relation of authority to legitimacy through the social construction of local histories that validate claims to 'authentic' rulership. Using the historical example of the Chiefdom of Uyombe in northern Zambia, I intend to argue that the construction of these local histories has been a crucial element in the process of domination, subjugation, resistance and collaboration between rulers and those they would rule. Exploring specific Gramscian concepts, I will also argue that historical narratives contain hegemonic and ideological components that are critical to relating authority to legitimacy in an active manner. These narratives contain African voices, which express varied local interests. Through the narratives, Africans may be seen as active agents in contributing to the making of their own local histories of rulership. Thus, authority and legitimacy are conjoined through the fabrication, inscription and recitation of historical narratives and are an essential part of governance.<br>

Abstract: How is metaphor possible? How is it interpreted? What is the place of the phenomenon of metaphor in a theory of meaning and in semantics? The following assumptions guide this study: (1) There is a semantics of metaphor; (2) metaphors are governed by rules that, in turn, govern the process of accepting and interpreting metaphorical utterances; (3) one theory should be able to deal with three kinds of metaphors-poetic metaphors, dead metaphors, and ordinary-discourse metaphors which are not completely dead, frozen, inventive, or innovative; (4) metaphors have a logical-semantic basis; (5) all modularities of language should be taken into account (age, exposure, dialect, context, open textures of meanings, etc.); and (6) a theory of metaphor should yield criteria for evaluating the beauty and value of metaphors.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Tourangeau Raymond W.<br>
Abstract: My purpose in this article is to describe how and why theories of metaphor vary in the ways they do. I argue that theories of metaphor differ precisely because they emphasize different temporal stages in the process of understanding metaphorical expressions. The different temporal points at which theories propose that a metaphor has been understood, ranging from the first milliseconds of processing to extended, reflective analysis, distinguish rival accounts of metaphor. In this respect, metaphor theories do not necessarily compete with one another, but can best be evaluated through an appreciation of the specific time-course that underlies metaphor understanding. My discussion reviews some of the major theoretical approaches to metaphor and reveals their (mostly implicit) assumptions about the time-course of interpretation. I suggest that most theories of metaphor draw unjustified conclusions about the entire time-course of metaphor understanding because of the particular temporal stage of understanding that each attempts to describe. Thinking about metaphor in terms of the time-course of comprehension should permit much of the theoretical pluralism presently seen in the multidisciplinary study of metaphor.<br>

Abstract: J. Martin and R. Harr&: "There is, however,

form, cannot. This is to supply a term where one is lacking in our vocabulary, the process
of catachresis. .... In the language of the linguists, catachresis is the activity of filling lexical
gaps. Simile cannot, for reasons of syntactic form, be easily used in catachresis. One may
say of the voluble guide 'He's just like Cicero used to be,' but the catachretical form will be
'He's a cicerone' " (1982: 101)<br>

Abstract: Perhaps the greatest challenge to an existential phenomenological account of perception is that posed by the argument from illusions. Recent developments in research on the behaviour of subjects suffering from illusions together with some seminal ideas found in Merleau-Ponty's writings enable us to develop and corroborate an account of the phenomenon of illusions, one, which unlike the empiricist account, does not undermine our conviction that in perception we "reach the things themselves". The traditional argument from illusions derives its force from an uncritical assumption that the process of experience takes place in time conceived as an infinite series of distinct moments. Once this assumption has been bracketed we are able to recognise the paradoxical truth that in the disillusion something can become that which it has always been and can cease to be that which it has never been. Furthermore, through a reflection on our experience of others overcoming their illusions, and on psychological evidence, we are able to show that there is nothing to suggest that this description of the disillusion is a description of a private or subjective event.<br>

Abstract: Rwanda became a Belgian trusteeship under mandate of the Société des Nations after the first World War. With churches playing a prominent role in the political evolution of Rwanda, the two countries were closely bound together. After the 1959 revolution in Rwanda and independence in 1962, development cooperation with strong NGO input still linked them. While the genocide still has tragic influence on the new Rwanda, Belgium has undergone a political process leading to a federal state. The colonial past refers to a national past. Changes in Rwanda and Belgium question any collective attempt of mourning for a past that is very different for all parties involved. /// Le Rwanda devint une possession de la Belgique sous le mandat de la Société des Nations après la Première Guerre Mondiale. La conséquence du rôle proéminent des églises dans l'évolution politique du Rwanda fut la création de liens étroits entre les deux pays. Après la révolution de 1959 au Rwanda et l'indépendance en 1962, la coopération de développement avec l'impact des ONG ont maintenu ces liens entre les deux pays. Alors que le génocide a aujourd'hui toujours des conséquences sur le Rwanda moderne, la Belgique a, elle, a vécu une transformation politique menant à la formation d'un état fédéral. Le passé colonial se mire dans le passé national. Les transformations du Rwanda et de la Belgique mettent en question toute tentative collective de faire l'expérience du deuil d'un passé commun, vécu de manière très différente par les deux cultures.<br>

Author(s): Vion Antoine<br>
Abstract: Town twinning can be seen as the first activity to involve municipal institutions as such in wide-ranging and long-term international action. Twinning fits Eric Hobsbawm's definition of an 'invented tradition'. The French federalists played a decisive part in this process of invention, bringing European municipalities together in order to ensure an eventual European political union. Before long, however, the so-called bilingualist movement also turned to twinning as a way to further a universal mutual understanding that transcended the East-West divide. This resulted in a big clash between the French twinning organisations. Thus, the invention of town twinning needs to be studied alongside the dynamic political tensions that emerged on the French political scene during the Cold War. /// Les jumelages urbains peuvent être considérés comme la première activité à impliquer les institutions municipales en tant que telles dans une action internationale de grande ampleur et de long terme. Le jumelage est un de ces 'traditions inventées' définies par Eric Hobsbawm. Les Fédéralistes français jouèrent un rôle décisif dans cette invention, qui regroupa un nombre important de municipalités européennes dans la perspective de construire l'union politique de la région. Très vite, des mouvements et définitions concurrentes se mirent en place, notamment avec le 'mouvement bilingue' qui s'empara des jumelages pour en faire l'outil d'une compréhension universelle qui aurait transcendé la division Est-Ouest. Une 'guerre des jumelages' fit rage pendant plusieurs années sur la scène française, guerre dont la compréhension appelle à l'inscription de ses enjeux dans le contexte de la Guerre Froide, et dont le déroulement participe de la dynamique de cette période. /// Städtepartnerschaften können als erster Versuch, städtische Institutionen in weiterreichende und dauerhafte internationale Aktivitäten einzubeziehen, gesehen werden.

Issue: i20184615<br>
Date: 11 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Iguchi Kawori<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i20453076<br>
Date: 9 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Shalin Dmitri N.<br>
Abstract: This article offers an alternative to classical hermeneutics, which focuses on discursive products and grasps meaning as the play of difference between linguistic signs. Pragmatist hermeneutics reconstructs meaning through an indefinite triangulation, which brings symbols, icons, and indices to bear on each other and considers a meaningful occasion as an embodied semiotic process. To illuminate the word-body-action nexus, the discussion identifies three basic types of signifying media: (1) the symbolic-discursive, (2) the somatic-affective, and (3) the behavioral-performative, each one marked by a special relationship between signs and their objects. An argument is made that the tension between various type-signifying media is unavoidable, that the pragmatic-discursive misalignment is an ontological condition, and that bridging the gap between our discursive, affective, and behavioral outputs is at the heart of ethical life.<br>

Abstract: ¿Cómo estudiar las experiencias sociales cuyas demandas escapan de los canales político-institucionales? Para llevar adelante este tipo de investigaciones, se encuentran coordenadas interesantes en el estudio del proceso sociopolítico y la subpolítica. Se desarrollan los niveles y las dimensiones con las que identificar e indagar lo sociopolítico. Así, aludimos tanto a las emociones como a los recursos culturales y simbólicos con los que construimos un modelo de análisis para dichas investigaciones. Esta perspectiva compara las maneras de explicar la aparición de las experiencias sociales a partir de la espontaneidad. El "cacerolazo" y las asambleas barriales ocurridos en la Argentina se constituyen en la experiencia social a partir de la cual poder reflexionar sobre tales cuestiones. /// How to study social experiences whose demands do not run through the political institutional channels? So as to put forward this kind of research, there are available interesting coordinates in the socio-political process and subpolitics. Levels and dimensions with which to identify and probe into the socio-political are developed. So, we refer both to the emotions as well as to the cultural and symbolic resources with which we construct a model of analysis to carry out such research. This approach confronts the ways to explain the emergence of social experiences taking spontaneity as a point of departure. The "cacerolazo" and the asambleas barriales which took place in Argentina make up the social experience from which we can reflect on such questions.<br>

Article Title: A Socio-Cultural Theorisation of Formative Assessment<br>
Publisher: Routledge Journals, Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i20462366<br>
Date: 2 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Crossouard Barbara<br>
Abstract: Formative assessment has attracted increasing attention from both practitioners and scholars over the last decade. This paper draws on the authors' empirical research conducted over eleven years in educational situations ranging from infant schools to postgraduate education to propose a theorisation of formative assessment. Formative assessment is seen as taking place when teachers and learners seek to respond to student work, making judgements about what is good learning with a view to improving that learning. However, the theorisation emphasises formative assessment as being a discursive social practice, involving dialectical, sometimes conflictual, processes. These bring into play issues of power in which learners' and teachers' identities are implicated and what counts as legitimate knowledge is framed by institutional discourses and summative assessment demands. The paper argues that, rather than only paying attention to the content of learning, an ambition for formative assessment might be to deconstruct these contextual issues, allowing a critical consideration of learning as a wider process of becoming. The article suggests a model that might be useful to teachers and learners in achieving this.<br>

Abstract: The assertion of prescriptive and adjudicative universal jurisdictions by some countries in relation to a handful of offenses that are classified as international or universal crimes (e.g. genocide) has led to a great deal of controversy. Those who favor universal jurisdiction argue that certain acts (often crimes) affect all of us, not just the specific individual or group of victims or the country of which the victims are nationals. It is therefore legitimate, they argue, for any state to punish or suppress such acts regardless of any traditional jurisdictional connection between the alleged acts and the state asserting jurisdiction. The availability of universal jurisdiction is premised on the presumed effect of certain crimes on humanity as a whole. Those who commit these offenses are referred to as hostis humani generis--enemies of human kind. Skeptics argue that the idea of universal jurisdiction is conceptually incoherent, inconsistent with the principle of political self-determination, and has great potential to be an instrument of political mischief. While they disagree on the conceptual coherence and utility of the notion of universal jurisdiction, both proponents and opponents view its function in purely instrumental terms, to provide the condition for punishing or suppressing certain offenses that affect all of us. This article argues that universal jurisdiction also serves another, less articulated purpose. It has a constitutive function as well. It is partly a process through which the identity of the international community is imagined and enacted. It is an expression of a sense of ourselves (a community of humankind) at given moments of time. This article argues that neglect of this constitutive dimension leads to an incomplete analysis of universal jurisdiction.<br>

Abstract: The introduction to the symposium sets out a methodological framework for the apprehension of Southeast Asian rituals, languages, and literary texts so that they are at once open to cross-cultural comparative analysis and recorded in social and symbolic contextual detail. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur's use of the term "interpretation" is central here: he urges students of cultures to combine attention to structural features of language and culture (for example, grammatical patterns) with inquiries into social contextual features (for example, speech usage in real communities). Moving back and forth between the two sorts of analysis allows researchers to bring the insights of the one pole to the investigation of the other; the full hermeneutic process constitutes interpretation. This style of inquiry, a modification of the sort of interpretive social science developed by Geertz and Becker, allows Southeast Asianists to draw on careful ethnography to make crucial "course corrections" in anthropological and linguistic theory building in general.<br>

Abstract: Using the example of former Yugoslavia, specifically the Serbian and Croatian nations, this article examines the transformation of collective memory of aggression and victimhood by focusing on the content of national narratives. The article begins by examining narratives developed at the founding of Yugoslavia and proceeds to trace the reinterpretation of these narratives as a function of their political instrumentality—especially in Serbia and Croatia—for respective nationalist projects. In the end, the article provides tools with which to frame two questions: first, whether political and social stability is being created at the cost of forgetting and repression; second, whether a "policy of remembrance" is socially "desirable" in practice. Both forgetting and an instrumental "policy of remembrance" based on the power of revelation perpetuate aggressor—victim divisions: what is needed, rather, is a stable, systematic process of remembrance and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Chile's collective memory has been brutalized by state-implemented terrorism. This historical process has resulted in, among other things, a "torn collective memory." The history and memory of the period of so-called popular power (1970-1973) continue to be largely unknown. Oral history allows us to begin a slow process of historical reconstruction as well as to reflect on the construction of militant memories.<br>

Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: The contribution outlines a research programme which I have coined the "sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse). This approach to discourse integrates important insights of FOUCAULT's theory of discourse into the interpretative paradigm in the social sciences, especially the "German" approach of hermeneutic sociology of knowledge (Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie). Accordingly, in this approach discourses are considered as "structured and structuring structures" which shape social practices of enunciation. Unlike some Foucauldian approaches, this form of discourse analysis recognises the importance of socially constituted actors in the social production and circulation of knowledge. Furthermore, it combines research questions related to the concept of "discourse" with the methodical toolbox of qualitative social research. Going beyond questions of language in use, "the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse) addresses sociological interests, the analyses of social relations and politics of knowledge as well as the discursive construction of reality as an empirical ("material") process. For empirical research on discourse the approach proposes the use of analytical concepts from the sociology of knowledge tradition, such as interpretative schemes or frames (Deutungsmuster), "classifications", "phenomenal structure" (Phänomenstruktur), "narrative structure", "dispositif" etc., and the use of the methodological strategies of "grounded theory".<br>

Abstract: Some literary theorists have suggested that the process of reading is a complex one and is central to the interpretation of texts. These theorists do not ignore the creation of texts or the authors' creative activities, but place special emphasis on the role of the reader. This approach has relevance for the study of the use of libraries. This paper offers an analogy between text and library and between reader and library user. The analogy is possible because both reader and user adopt intentional stances with regard to that which is to be interpreted and employ cognitive and affective means in interpretation. At the heart of this approach is a phenomenological-hermeneutical way of thinking that treats reading and library use as an event consisting of varying intention and interpretive possibilities.<br>

Abstract: This close reading of one poem by Dickinson, « Crisis is sweet », wishes to demonstrate that the poet makes us share in a multiple experience of crisis combining sexual climax, mystical revelation, and the destruction of the poetic image. Positing a multi-level definition of crisis, the poem shows that the very process of definition — undoubtedly one of Dickinson's preferred modes of tackling with reality — entails a fundamental crisis and criticism of representation.<br>

Abstract: Interpretation is central to the social scientist's process of analysis, regardless of whether that analysis relies on quantitative or qualitative data. This essay presents a "reconstructed logic" of the interpretation process involved in quantitative data analysis. Drawing upon a broad literature on interpretation, the paper shows how the interpretive processes for quantitative "data" has significant similarities to interpretation in other settings. For example, both qualitative textual analysis and quantitative statistical analysis rely upon contextual and topological paradigms, although the specific conventions differ in many respects. The process of play employed by musicians and actors in developing an interpretation of a piece of music or a dramatic role suggests ways in which the quantitative analyst might let data perform to help in arriving at appropriate interpretations of statistical results. The lines between quantitative and qualitative social science are less clear than often presumed. Both types of analysis involve extensive interpretation, and tools of interpretation that have many fundamental similarities.<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical

sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une
semantique historique," in Melanges en honneur de F. Braudel [Toulouse, 1973],

Author(s): Kane Anne E.<br>
Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Abstract: The process by which a neophyte approaches a religious group has a particular interest. The importance of the relation between leader and followers is thus revealed. The symbolic manipulation of charisms is the fundamental instrument allowing to maintain leadership. The steps of conversion, testimony and prophecy are decisive. Thus the deep link between charism and word is unveiled: the talk involves different modalities in the use of the word, the final interpretation of whic is always given by the charismatic leader.<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the meaning of tattooing as a form of narration. Introducing the body as a text that can convey different forms of thought (derived both from philosophy and from sociology), the author maintains that the body modification is today as an open and living work whose interpretation has an influence on the individual identity and can be changed by means of the interaction with others. A thumbnail sketch of the history of the practice among traditional communities up to contemporary society is drawn to provide a series of fundamental usages for the inscription of the body. The concern here is to show tattooing as an expression of the whole individual (no longer divided into mind vs. body) and of his own perceived identity, underlying the relation of the chosen symbols (and of the symbolic ritual) with society, which remains the main source offering forms of representation and the main stage for the construction of identity. So that the whole final text can be read as the result of a process where the authorship is shattered among the society itself.<br>

Abstract: What role do emotions play in the way in which young people confront the history of the Holocaust? This article examines memorial sites and video interviews of survivors as interfaces of the representation and appropriation of the past. These contact zones satisfy the need for emotional participation and for information. Videos uploaded by youngsters on the internet following their visit to memorial sites, and short films extracted by pupils from survivor's video interviews, were used as examples in order to examine emotional strategies. These products of involvement point to stored images and ideas mediated by mass media. This repertoire of cultural knowledge and feelings can serve as a template for understanding how young people process the Holocaust emotionally.<br>

Abstract: This essay focuses on a strange medieval phenomenon, the so-called gift of tears—religious weeping that brings beatitude. This internal purifying process, which was embedded in the specific conditions of historical Christianity, was described and understood as a procedure in which God himself acts and, therefore, as a process that humankind cannot learn, formalize, or ritualize. However, the author analyzes religious weeping as a peculiar, 'intimate ritual' in which the formalized process took place in the soul or spirituality of the weeping person. This essay aims to describe and analyze this practice while examining the historical conditions that enabled such a cultural elaboration to develop.<br>

Abstract: This article explores socio-cultural practices with regard to aging women in Vārāṇāsī, a city in North India. It is based on 17 months of field research carried out in 1999—2000 among marginalized Hindu women. I argue that aging is a continuous process that is characterized by the specific psychological patterns that form throughout a woman's life history. These patterns are demonstrated by women's particular types of behaviors and demeanors and, in turn, permit others to ascribe to them—in varying combinations and ratios—specific cultural values or qualities. I argue that these attributes are the critical ones that inform the cultural construction and designation of being 'middle-aged' and 'older' as it pertains to Hindu women of Vārāṇāsī.<br>

Author(s): Chriss James J.<br>
Abstract: Alvin Gouldner's life and work is considered within the framework of his own attempt to fashion a reflexive sociology during the second half of his career. In the first half, Gouldner was a functionalist and dutifully contributed insights and theoretical innovations to the paradigm, even while remaining critical of Talcott Parsons' own version of structural-functionalism. Later, by 1962, Gouldner broke from the dominant tradition to become an outspoken critique of establishment sociology, in the process becoming more sympathetic to competing theories, especially Marxism. Eventually, Marxism, too, was found to be inadequate because of its lack of reflexivity, and Gouldner became further alienated from both traditions of sociology. Concomitantly, Gouldner was battling on personal and professional fronts in his role of social critic. He became increasingly hostile toward others for their willing compliance with prevailing cultural prescriptions, which he believed were robbing human beings of their agency, vitality, and will to power. Lacking authentic knowledge of oneself, one could not hope to create social theories which benefited society and contributed to the liberation of the human spirit. Gouldner was a tragic hero, for although he came to an understanding of the limitations of human strivings in creating socially beneficial social theory, and fought valiantly to establish a program to fill this lacuna, he ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of these insights because of his own hubris (on the personal front) and the internal paradoxes of reflexive sociology (on the professional front).<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): SLATMAN JENNY<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: The ultramodern condition represents the "third wave" in postmodernist-inspired philosophy and cultural practice. Two of ultramodernism's critical theoretical components are the human/social forces, flows, and assemblages that sustain transgression; and the human/social intensities, fluctuations, and thresholds that make transcendence possible as both will and way. In the ultramodern age, then, transcendence is about overcoming and transforming the conditions (i.e., forces, flows, and assemblages) that co-produce harm-generating (i.e., transgressive) tendencies. This manuscript problematizes transgression by way of ultramodern theory. This critical investigation represents "the phenomenology of the shadow," or the ultramodern philosophy of harm. To contextualize this phenomenology and philosophy, the intellectual history of ultramodern thought is recounted. This includes a review of the shadow construct by way of its prominent socio-cultural, psychoanalytic, and political-economic currents; and a chronicling of the reification process (regarding risk, captivity, and harm) since the modernist era (i.e., the industrial revolution). The article concludes with some very speculative observations concerning "the phenomenology of the stranger," or the ultramodern philosophy of transcendence as both will and way.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to define the nature of the metaphor in Berdiczewski's novel Miriam (1921). For this purpopse I examine the short story included in Miriam about the scholar who was studying a book entitled The Gate of Heaven. Comparing this story with other literary texts which present a hero who stands in a mystical or philosophical sense before the gate of Heaven illuminates the historic-generative essence of the above metaphor. Using the theoretical and methodological system developed by three scholars (P. Ricuer, D. Schon and B. Indurkyia) to follow the metaphorical process, I attempt to show that Berdiczewski's metaphors are not only figures of speech; they form our essential cultural and historical cognition (tolada in Hebrew). I therefore suggest applying to Berdiczewski's metaphor the form 'historic-generative metaphor.'<br>

Abstract: The paper examines the process of figurative reading in the presence of a marker (like / as), namely the unique cognitive impact caused by shaping figurative expressions as similes. The solution is sought through theoretical discussion and analysis of relevant excerpts from Hebrew poetry. Recently Bethlehem argued that a simile does not necessarily indicate the presence of resemblance of some sort; the simile only presents itself as such via its marker, like/as, but actually it can bear a variety of figurative relations, of which metaphoric relations are only one possible option. Consequently, simile has only coincidental relations with metaphor, if any (Bethlehem, 1996: 1997) First I address this criticism, trying to reinforce the widespread view that a simile is indeed a sub-type of metaphor, and that there is no fundamental difference between them, that is, comprehension processes in metaphor and simile are basically similar. Next I distinguish the simile from the literal comparison in a new comprehensive way. Finally I try to identify and study the special impression a figurative expression might create as a result of being shaped as a simile. Despite this basic sameness of simile and metaphor, the marker's presence in a simile has its unique cognitive effects, accumulating to a distinctive impact. I analyze the unique cognitive effects potentially evolved during the construction process of the simile's meaning. In this analysis this paper reexamines central issues pertaining to similes, their essence, and the cognitive processes they trigger in readers. Among these I focus on a problem never thoroughly explored so far: the essential nature of the coexistence of similarity and dissimilarity (without working against each other) in both metaphor and simile.<br>

Abstract: It has been argued that in higher education academic disciplines can be seen as communities of practices. This implies a focus on what constitutes identities in academic culture. In this article I argue that the transition from newcomer to a full participant in a community of practice of physicists entails a focus on how identities emerge in learning how to highlight certain aspects of personal life histories. The analysis of interviews with 55 physicists shows that physicists often perceive experiences in their childhood as the first step into their professional identities as physicists. These experiences involve recollections of the ability to think scientifically (e.g., 'go beyond the surface'), and the ability to play with toys which can be connected to the practical life of physics. The process of identity formation can be described as developing in a relational zone of proximal development, where old-timers recognize particular playful qualities in newcomers as a legitimate access to a physicist identity. The article discusses how play which physicists connects with a scientific mind can constitute a relational zone of proximal developments in a community of practice as a particular "space of authoring" in a physicist culture, which cut across other cultural differences. Il a été admis que les disciplines de l'éducation supérieure peuvent être considérées comme des communautés de pratique. Cela pose la question de savoir comment se constituent les identités dans la culture académique. Dans cet article, pour mettre en évidence la transition de nouveau venu à participant à part entière dans une communauté de pratique de physiciens, j'examine non seulement la manière dont des identités émergent au travers des pratiques, mais aussi les aspects biographiques que les participants identifient comme ayant facilité leur transition. Une cohorte de 55 physiciens a été interviewée et leurs analyses ont été comparées à des données supplémentaires, notamment tirées d'une ob~<br>

Abstract: Le patrimoine est devenu un terme particulièrement utilisé dans le vocabulaire politique et culturel tout autant qu'il est devenu très usité dans le monde académique. De l'avis de bien des auteurs, tout serait devenu patrimoine. Certains s'inquiètent de cette inflation patrimoniale, considérée comme un symptôme d'un nouveau rapport au temps présent. Cette contribution tente de montrer, en partant du champ d'investigation travaillé par les géographes, que toutes ces approches peuvent en réalité être reconsidérées de manière plus globale. Ce texte pose l'hypothèse qu'elles s'inscrivent dans une chronogenèse, c'est-à-dire une mise en récit des éléments épars grâce à la création d'un discours caractérisé par une accumulation de signes et d'éléments permettant de penser et de se représenter linéairement l'image-temps. En s'inspirant notamment du travail engagé par P. Ricœur sur la notion de temporalité, ce texte défend l'idée que les éléments patrimonialisés participent d'une logique de mise en intrigue, et plus largement d'une mise en cohérence d'éléments hétérogènes, servant à articuler des récits. Ceux-ci autorisent à repenser une certaine unité de l'histoire de l'humanité dans son rapport au monde physique. Heritage has become a very common term in political and cultural discourse, as well as a widely used term in the academic world. Numerous authors have pointed out that everything has become heritage, and expressed concern that such terminological inflation can be seen as a symptom of a new relationship to the present. Based on investigations conducted primarily by French geographers, this paper explores this academic research as revealing a process of "Chronogenesis" (Chronogenèse) : in this, scattered elements are embedded into a narrative, creating a discourse characterized by an accumulation of signs and elements that allows a linear conception and representation of the image and time. Inspired by the work of P. Ricœur on the notion of temporality, this article~<br>

Abstract: Archaeological examinations of symbolic meaning often have been hampered by the Saussurean concept of signs as coded messages of preexisting meanings. The arbitrary and imprecise manner by which meaning is represented in material culture according to Saussure tends to stymie archaeological investigations of symbolism. As an alternative, archaeologists recently have drawn on Peirce's semiotic to investigate how materiality is bound to the creation of meanings through the process of signification. This study examines how the symbolism expressed in pottery of the Middle Woodland period south-eastern United States, Swift Creek Complicated Stamped and Weeden Island effigy vessels, might be better explained as icons and indexes that were enlisted to have particular social effects. Examining the semiotic potentials of these objects helps explain their apparent uses and the significance of alternative representations of the same subjects. En repetidas ocasiones los estudios arqueológicos sobre el significado de símbolos han sido obstaculizados por el concepto Saussureano que define los signos como mensajes codificados con un significado preexistente. De acuerdo con Saussure, la manera arbitraria e imprecisa por la cual cierto significado se encuentra representado en la cultura material tiende a bloquear las investigaciones arqueológicas que estudian objetos simbólicos. Como alternativa los arqueólogos han comenzado a basarse en la semiótica de Peirce, con el fin de investigar de qué manera la materialidad está ligada a la creación de significados a través del proceso de creación de signos o significación. En este estudio se examinaron piezas de alfarería del sur oriente de los Estados Unidos, provenientes del periodo medio Woodland, de los complejos estampados Swift Creek y esfinges representadas en vasijas Weeden Island. El objetivo es demostrar que los símbolos expresados en dichas piezas podrían ser interpretados como iconos e índices que fueron establecidos para efectos~<br>

Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of interpreting the concepts of tradition and traditionalism with specific reference to the tradition of the Anatolian house and the recent erosion of place quality in Turkish towns. The Anatolian house provides a remarkable example of cultural diffusion and transformation. During the reign of the late Ottoman, a variety of cultures impinged on one another, giving rise to autochthonous traditions that were shared by different religious and ethnic groups. But during the Republican Period the process of Westernization interrupted the continuity of historic traditions, resulting in the emergence of a peculiar contemporary tradition. The majority of Turkish housing today displays characteristics of a "vernacular modernism" conditioned by the moral and technical orders of a market economy. The worldwide spread of such cultural mediocrity has often been attributed to the corrosive influence of a single world civilization. A number of recent attempts have been made to search for a national idiom in Turkey. But these attempts, often promoting a "vernacular historicism," have yet to account for any distinct revision of urban house-form. Argument today revolves around an old rhetorical opposition between universal civilization and national culture. Should a post-traditional society sustain its cultural tradition to attain universal values, or vice-versa? The conservative in this debate is more involved in the revival than in the preservation of tradition. The progressive, though an ardent defender of preservation, resists revivalism because of its chauvinistic connotations and pastiche effects. This paper attempts to resolve this argument by suggesting a simultaneous unfolding of the historical problems of the Anatolian house tradition and the theoretical problems of presumed dichotomies such as "traditional vs. modern." Finally, the paper advocates the development of research strategies to facilitate correct readings of cultural tradition and~<br>

Abstract: L'article aborde la question de l'universalisation que l'on attend du processus actuel de mondialisation, qui unifie la planète sur la base de l'économie du marché. Sous la poussée de la rationalité scientifique, la mondialisation réalise une universalisation de moyens susceptibles d'ouvrir potentiellement à toute l'humanité l'accès à des biens élémentaires qui améliorent son bien-être en libérant du besoin. On remarque toutefois que, sous l'influence de l'idéologie néolibérale, la prédominance de la dimension économique invertit la mondialisation en un projet instrumental de la part de ceux qui considèrent toute réalité, y compris l'homme, comme un moyen. La mondialisation produit ainsi une universalisation rationnelle qui concerne les choses ou les moyens, et non les hommes. Loin donc de réaliser la véritable universalisation de l'humanité, elle en pose tout au plus les conditions matérielles d'avènement et laisse de côté le problème crucial de la reconnaissance de l'homme par l'homme. The article addresses the question of the universalisation that can be expected from the current process of globalisation, which unifies the planet on the basis of the market economy. Propelled by scientific rationality, globalisation is producing a universalisation of resources that has the potential of providing all of humanity access to those basic goods which increase wellbeing by eliminating need. Nonetheless, it is observed that, under the influence of neoliberal ideology, the predominance of the economic dimension transforms globalisation into a project used by those who consider all reality, including human beings, as a means. Globalisation thus produces a rational universalisation that impacts things and resources but not human beings. Far from bringing about a true universalisation of humanity, globalisation at the most sets the material conditions of access but leaves to the side the crucial problem of the mutual recognition of man for man.<br>

Abstract: Johann Georg Hamann saw the written word of God as the ultimate consequence of his incarnation. The biblical texts as well also carry the death of Christ in their essence as a figure of incarnation. Roland Barthes called the process of putting these texts into writing, by which the text gains autonomy in relation to the author, the "death of the author". In terms of the theology of the Holy Scriptures, this idea can be connected to the way people have been talking about the death of God in the modern age. One must however distinguish between the death of the author and the death of the text. This occurs when exegesis does not want to accept the death of the author. When however during reading there is a new understanding of biblical texts, this means to a certain extent their resurrection.<br>

Article Title: LES CHEVAUX COLORÉS DE L'«APOCALYPSE» I : L'Apocalypse de Jean, Zacharie et les traditions de l'Iran<br>

Abstract: Comment expliquer la « fonctionnalité » des quatre cavaliers de l'Apocalypse de Jean? Si le passage fait référence à l'une des visions nocturnes du Proto-Zacharie, les couleurs (blanc, rouge, noir) et les attributs (arc, épée, balance) renvoient très nettement à un schéma indo-européen, celui des trois fonctions duméziliennes, auxquelles certains proposent d'ajouter une quatrième, qu'incarnerait ici le dernier cheval verdâtre. Il s'agit donc très probablement d'une création de l'auteur à partir d'une donnée empruntée à l'Iran. Cet emprunt est à replacer au sein des échanges entre traditions judéo-chrétiennes et indo-européennes, processus en partie responsable du développement de l'apocalyptique. How can we explain the « functional » pattern of the four riders, in the Revelation of John? If the passage refers to one of the night visions to be found in Proto-Zechariah, the colours — white, red, black — and the attributes — bow, sword, and a set of scales — clearly relate back to an Indo-European pattern, which corresponds to the three functions defined by Dumézil, to which some would propose to add a fourth function, embodied here by the last « pale » horse. One then can very likely infer that the text might have been devised by the author out of data borrowed from Iranian sources. Such borrowings are to be replaced within the current of exchanges that fared between Jewish-Christians traditions and Indo-Europeans ones, a process that partly led to the development of apocalyptic trends.<br>

Article Title: Inside and Outside the EU's "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice": Reflexive Identity and the Unity of Legal Space<br>
Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676298<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Lindahl Hans<br>
Abstract: "It is essential," Hans Kelsen asserts provocatively, "that one state also have one territory, that the territory of a state form a unity." What, then, determines the territorial unity a legal community necessarily claims for itself? And why is this claim to territorial unity irreducibly problematic? These questions are particularly pressing, both theoretically and practically, with respect to the European Union's "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice," set to be consolidated in the novel Constitution for Europe. Rejecting any attempt to make sense of legal space in terms of geography, this Paper argues that the spatial unity of the European Union emerges in the reflexive process by which this legal community stakes out a territory as its own. Probing the notion of an "own" legal space, this Paper points to, and offers examples of, a strong form of exteriority that is inside what the EU calls its own territory: "another Europe" is — literally — elsewhere. This strong form of exteriority arises in the very same representational process by which the EU constitutes itself as a unitary Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. In effect, an analysis of key legal texts reveals that Europe is the place the Union claims to be originally its own, yet also the place to which it has no direct access. Finally, these considerations are brought to bear on Article 64 (1) of the EC Treaty, which holds Member States responsible for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal security.<br>

Abstract: The antipositivist movement of the past two decades or so in economics, economic history, and history reveals the scope for a rapprochement, a growth of mutual respect and understanding, and perhaps even more active collaboration between the practitioners of these disciplines. The emergence of a more open-minded and flexible approach to economic methodology, and a more sophisticated awareness of the nature of historical explanation underlie this process. And the economists' increasing preoccupation with problems of time, expectations, uncertainty, and limited information provides substantive incentives for the widespread and varied efforts to break out of the confines of conventional static equilibrium theorizing.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23730921<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Pérez Lara Campos<br>
Abstract: This article takes a close look at the iconographic construction of the so-called "otherness" in Spain between 1936 and 1945. During this three year period of civil unrest, the Franco regime set out to cast the defeated half of the war as an inimical "other." In this process of building an impression of the "other," the "New State," created after April 1, 1939, played an important role, since in many ways the existence of this enemy "other" could favour unity between the rest, or "us." The State used mandatory education as an efficient socialization tool in this process. The text looks at the different ways in which the image of the "other" was used in books that taught History, Civic Education and Patriotic Education in primary school.<br>

Abstract: Para evitar la mercantilización de la academia sin renunciar a los beneficios de un intercambio sistemático entre la Universidad y el mercado, es fundamental construir zonas de intercambio entre las dos esferas. Diferentes perspectivas teóricas pueden guiar ese proceso de construcción. Sin embargo, los enfoques actuales no permiten explicar por qué, en presencia de las mismas estructuras y culturas, unas zonas de intercambio son a veces percibidas como ejercicios auténticamente no hegemónicos de contacto entre la Universidad y el mercado, y a veces no. Para explicar ese fenómeno es necesario abordar la construcción de zonas de intercambio como performance social y analizarla desde la pragmática cultural. Este trabajo introducirá esa aproximación con referencia a la reciente construcción de una zona de intercambio entre la Universidad y el mercado en la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, que se dio mediante un proyecto llamado Catella. Areas for exchange between universities and the market must be constructed to avoid mercantilising the academic world without renouncing the benefits of a systematic exchange between both spheres. Different theoretical viewpoints could guide the construction process. However, current approaches do not explain why (in the presence of the same structures and cultures) some areas of exchange are sometimes perceived as being authentically non-hegemonic exercises in contact between the university and the market and sometimes no so. Areas for exchange must thus be constructed (such as social performance) for explaining this phenomenon and analyse it from cultural pragmatics. This work introduces such an approach, referring to the recent construction of an area for exchange between the university and the market in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia via a project named "Catella". Pour éviter la mercantilisation de l'académie sans renoncer aux bénéfices d'un échange systématique entre l'université et le marché, il est fondamental de construire~<br>

Abstract: We can distinguish two different kinds in the educational process, the one called «learning education» and the one leading to a possible «autonomous education» in which every-body's freedom is above everything else. The former is education for technoscientists. The later, the «autonomous education» is supported by the thesis that knowing oneself as «moriturus», forces one to provide a sense or meaning, technologies and educational sciencies not being enough. Death forces us to decide the possible, only opposed by the impossible.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the role of teacher, in the process of curriculum development, is conceptually dependent on the different curriculum approaches. It has been analysed and discussed the instrumental role (user and implementor) which it has from a technical-scientific approach, the curriculum development agent's role from an interpretative-cultural view, and the role of the institucional development from a critical approach. The potentialities and insufficiencies of a curriculum practical view and the teacher's role have been analysed. We suggest the School Institutional Development as one of the most promising ways for curriculum development.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le déb~<br>

Abstract: Au Portugal, au début des années 1930, quand cesse l'expérience républicaine et laïque qui avait été très marquée par l'intervention politique des médecins, le psychiatre type était neurologue, positiviste et anticlérical. Avec le régime conservateur de l'Estado Novo, les médecins catholiques, dont les psychiatres, ont opéré une reprise en main qui, en quelques décennies, a changé la nature sociopolitique de la psychiatrie institutionnalisée. Nourris par de nouveaux courants scientifiques, religieux et idéologiques, les savoirs et les pratiques cliniques des psychiatres se sont accommodés du contexte politique et religieux de l'Estado Novo. Un de ces courants, la psychanalyse, a joué un rôle inattendu dans le rapprochement entre psychiatrie et catholicisme. Ce rapprochement est analysé, ainsi que ses conséquences épistémiques, pratiques et institutionnelles. In Portugal of the early 1930s, in the aftermath of the secularist regime of the First Republic, marked by a significant political involvement of doctors, the typical psychiatrist was a positivist and anticlerical neurologist. With the conservative regime of Estado Novo, Catholic doctors, including psychiatrists, undertook a takeover which, in a few decades, changed the socio-political nature of institutionalized psychiatry. Influenced by new scientific, religious and ideological trends, the knowledge and clinical practices of psychiatrists adapted to the political and religious context of Estado Novo. One of these currents, psychoanalysis, played an unexpected role in the rapprochement between psychiatry and Catholicism. This process of rapprochement is analysed as well as its epistemic consequences and institutional practices. En Portugal, en la década de 1930, tras la experiencia laica de la Primera República, muy marcada por la intervención de los médicos en política, el psiquiatra tipo era neurólogo, positivista y anticlerical.

Abstract: Dans les sociétés occidentales, la temporalité religieuse a imposé au temps social un modèle linéaire, largement tributaire des traditions eschatologiques judéo-chrétiennes, produit d'une lente élaboration forgée à partir d'influences diverses, dont celle du zoroastrisme. Cette perception d'un temps univoque est construite sur un paradoxe en liant cette progression continue à une mise en acte du processus eschatologique au moyen de rites inscrits dans la périodisation cyclique du calendrier. Cette actualisation par le rite des mythes qui le sous-tendent impose ainsi au présent, au passé et au futur de se rejoindre périodiquement au gré de la célébration de fêtes calendaires. In western societies, Judeo-Christianity imposed on time a linear model, born from eschatological traditions formed through diverse influences, including zoroastrianism. This perception of time as univocal is built upon a paradoxical view binding this continual progress to an enactment of the eschatological process through rituals inscribed in the cyclical periodization of the calendar. This actualization through rites of myths subtending them impose to the present, past and future to join periodically according to calendar celebrations. La temporalidad religiosa ha impuesto al tiempo de las sociedades occidentales un modelo lineal, ampliamente tributario de las tradiciones escatológicas judeo-cristianas, producto de una lenta elaboración forjada a partir de influencias diversas, entre ellas la del zoroastrismo. Esta percepción de un tiempo unívoco se construye sobre una paradoja que liga esta progresión continua a una puesta en acto del proceso escatológico por medio de ritos inscriptos en la periodización cíclica del calendario. Esta actualización por el rito de los mitos que subyacen a él impone así al presente, al pasado y al futuro una reunión periódica al ritmo de la celebración de las fiestas del calendario.<br>

Abstract: Objective: Traumatic memories are characterized by not being accessible to intentional recall nor being integrated into the matrix of autobiographical memory. Based on this description, the authors discuss the process of narration as a central means of regaining a sense of self-coherence after traumatic experiences. Formally correct narratives are characterized by three functions: orientation, reference and evaluation. Through so-called "memory talk" with socio-culturally competent partners, children learn how to reconstruct memories and to represent experience by narration. It is therefore suggested that narratives are the basic ingredient of autobiographical memory. The process of re-establishing a sense of coherence after trauma relies on the capacity for coherent narration. The latter is often not possible with traumatic experiences. Method and Result: We conducted a literature search in multiple databases for linguistic analyses of trauma narratives empirically correlating narrative style and posttraumatic psychopathology. Discussion: It is recommended that research in psychopathology and psychotherapy should take issues of language into account more systematically. Fragestellung: Ein zentrales Merkmal traumatischer Erfahrungen besteht darin, dass sie nicht als episodisch strukturierte, bewusstseinsfähige und erzählbare Erinnerungen in das autobiographische Gedächtnis integriert sind. Hiervon ausgehend wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit diskutiert, inwiefern der Prozess der Narrativierung als eine integrative Funktion der Gedächtnisrepräsentation aufgefasst werden kann. Dabei wird das narrative Format als zentraler „Baustein“ des autobiographischen Gedächtnisses postuliert. Kohärente Narrative sind durch drei Funktionen gekennzeichnet: Orientierung, Referenz und Evaluation. Diese werden in der Sprachentwicklung durch „memory talk“ mit soziokulturell kompetenten Partnern erworben. Mit der Überführung autobiographischer Erfahrungen in ein kohärentes Narrativ kann Se~<br>

Abstract: This article considers the production of an Islamic utopian or millennial discourse by British South Asian Muslims in the diasporic public sphere and its possible impact on the younger generation of Muslims growing up in the UK. Associated with such a discourse, the article considers the vulnerability of diasporas — the process whereby global events can precipitate radical diasporic estrangement, leading to self-estrangement. Such estrangement is fed by moral panics, expressed in the speeches of politicians, in newspaper columns and global news reports. This exposes the fragility of multicultural discourses in the public sphere in the UK.<br>

Issue: i23880984<br>
Date: 12 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): ANTHIAS FLOYA<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Abstract: Creating one's identity is an on-going process, which is greatly dependent on language. Having this idea as a starting point in the study of religiosity, sharing self-reported experiences can be seen as an integral part in constructing one's religious identity and personal conviction. In this article, I would like to present the idea of bringing together narrative research and the psychological approach to the study of religious experience with the help of personal experience stories about God's guidance told by Christian believers who are members of a charismatic revival movement.<br>

Issue: i23912365<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Kwon Soo-Young<br>
Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Abstract: Mythical configurations of a personal deity and a dominant sexual identity are part of our western history. In particular, the religious myths of patriarchy have privileged a male God and devalued female desire—and, with her desire, sexual difference. There can be no facile way beyond these myths. Instead the proposal here is for feminist theologians to attempt new configurations of old myths and disruptive refigurations, i.e. transformative mimesis, of biased beliefs. Myth and mimesis can enable expression of multiple identities. Only identities-in-process preserve the possibility for a peaceful revolution of our desires and our differences, religious and sexual.<br>

Abstract: Bible reading occurs at intersection of perpetually shifting canons—of textual meaning, interpretative strategies, and preferred textual menu for particular contemporary consumption. Such continual up-to-datedness is the Bible's, as it is the classic's, only survival kit. Contemporary reading is the only reading—ever. Post-modernism's biblical reading menu is notable for its post-modernist yields of meaning; but textual post-modernism—aporias, textual unboundedness, canonical on-edgedness, apocryphalism, etcetera—is typical of biblical texts' ur-post-modernism (the Bible living up, of course, to applied post-modernist reading expectations). All such reading is an aestheticisation, a fictionalising process—abusive naturally; constructively abusive, perhaps; but always catachretical, demythologising, a negative theology. But, of course, this is utterly inevitable for now.<br>

Abstract: I propose both a critique of canonicity and a feminist defence of the careful re-reading of certain canonical texts. My proposal for a critique of the limits of our thinking about and with texts is informed by a re-reading of the canonical text of Kant. Admittedly Kant himself might be excluded from any possible feminist canon whether in literary theory or theology. However, my qualified defence of the Kantian text is part of a larger concern to rethink texts by men and women. The aim is not to reaffirm a conservative culture, but to provide crucial tools for the judgements and practices of still highly significant forms of critical hermeneutics. In particular, the process of suppression and repression of valuable texts by women and minorities cannot properly be reversed without taking seriously the particular skills of post-Kantian critique. Critical and historical skills will help distinguish when to think merely about a text and when to think with it so that we might come up with a new picture of canon.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews Paul Ricœur's account of the dialectical opposition between justice and love. First, I explore the dissonances between the just and the good in the practice of justice. Secondly, a review of the different interpretations of the Biblical Golden Rule and the commandment of love is presented, considering how the creative tension between them and the supraethical dimensions of creation, revelation, and redemption revise and correct justice. Finally, I present a critique of this dialectical process while reconsidering — through several Levinasian propositions — the very conception of justice.<br>

Abstract: Es wird eine Theorie des Gedächtnisses für autobiographisches Material dargestellt. Diese Theorie beinhaltet als zentrale Annahmen: Einen Symbolbildungsprozeß, der einerseits affektiv erlebte Objektbeziehungen innerlich in Form von Propositionen (Repräsentanzen) abbildet und andererseits diese Repräsentanzen wiederum in mitteilbare Symbole transformiert; Verdrängung, die solche Repräsentanzen erfassen kann und somit ein Unbewußtes schafft, das in Objektbeziehungen gründet; Abwehrprozesse, die Teil der Symbolisierungsfunktion sind und die unbewußte Repräsentanzen in bewußte, aber verzerrte Symbole transformieren. Erklärt werden sollen durch diese Theorie Gedächtnisphänomene wie Erinnern, verzerrtes Erinnern und Wiederholen vom Charakter des Wiederholungszwanges. A theory of memory for biographical material is proposed. This theory consists in the following central assumptions: a symbol formation process, which on the one hand maps affectively experienced object relations into inner propositions (representations) and on the other hand transforms representations into communicable symbols; repression which may affect representations and which thus establishes an unconsciousness which is rooted in object relations; defense mechanisms, which are part of the symbol formation process and which transform unsonscious representations into conscious but distorted symbols. This theory is supposed to explain remembering, distorted remembering, and phenomena of compulsive repetition.<br>

Abstract: Text interpretation – the main interest of discourse analysts – is a central component of the text understanding process. In this article we introduce the Landscape Model, which describes the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension in a detailed and precise manner. Moreover, this model captures the interpretative processes in which the human mind engages during reading. Within the context of the Landscape Model, we describe the relation between discourse understanding and discourse interpretation, and explain some of the phenomena that are central to the field of discourse analysis as seen from a cognitive perspective. In the first section we describe the basic cognitive processes that underlie discourse understanding, as captured by the Landscape Model. In the following section we illustrate the way that the Landscape Model can be applied to the work of discourse analysts. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the cognitive Landscape Model for the field of discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Original Sin is considered to be a uniquely Christian doctrine. Nevertheless, an analysis of apparently forgotten Jewish treatises — most of which are to be found only in manuscript form — reveals that an extraordinary philosophical theory of Original Sin is present in late medieval Jewish thought. It implies, therefore, a new dimension in characterising this doctrine and has implications for the understanding of the process of inter-communicating of Jewish and Christian thought. This study focuses on fundamental Jewish passages, beginning with Apocalyptic literature and ending with medieval philosophical texts. Yet, the examination of those Hebrew texts is carried out in the light of the writing of Christian scholars. This means that the attempt to clarify this Jewish doctrine is made, from a methodological viewpoint, both by looking at the development of this doctrine trough the history of the Jewish thought, and by a close examination of the parallel general sources. It is only then that one can see that rudiments of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin were inserted into the Aristotelian theory of Nature, and combined with elements from Maimonides' Biblical-allegoric exegesis.<br>

Abstract: Son ya varias las décodas transcurridas desde que los estudios de folklore en general y la etnomusicología en particular se han visto dominados por la analitica deconstructiva y el pensamiento culturalista, configurando un bloque paradigmático sumamente influyente en el multidisciplinar territorio de las ciencias sociales. Las aportaciones provenientes de estas corrientes han resultado en líneas generates de gran valor e interés para la comunidad científica, ensanchando y dinamizando el hasta entonces relativamente reducido campo de acción e interpretación de disciplinas como la musicología comparada. Sin embargo el proceso de renovación académica –que encabezarían obras como las de Benedict Anderson y Eric Hobsbawm– ha implicado asimismo un desigual desplazamiento del foco de atención desde el objeto de estudio mismo hacia la esfera de su contexto, relevancia social e implicaciones ideológicas. La deconstrucción se ha ejercido particularmente en contra del aserto diferencial, subrayando sus debilidades argumentales, excesos etnocéntricos y –con frecuencia– obvios intereses espurios, una tarea históricamente necesaria pero que a la par ha sustraído del folklore todo valor ontológico en aras de su significado, y del trabajo científico el vital soporte empírico, que ahora se ve arrinconado por una elaboración altamente abstracta al amparo de un lenguaje en el límite de la saturación semántica. Este artículo explora la vía crítica descrita para concluir planteando determinadas alternativas en defensa de una tradición sostenible –a pesar del vigor innegable y sinergético de las fuerzas del progreso, los procesos de hibridación y globalización y las alteraciones provenientes del constructo folklorista–, así como del hecho diferencial implícito y su asunción y gestión no indefectiblemente en el marco de un proyecto político o comercial. Studies of folklore in general and ethnomusicology in particular have been dominated by deconstructive analysis and culturalist theory fo~<br>

Abstract: After a few remarks about the precise definition of a modern concept (damnatio memoriae) from ancient realities (damnati, abolitio memoriae), this introduction deals with a selection of examples on erasure and methodological or historiographical problems. These examples are founded on the constitution of an epigraphical and literary databank from a geographical perspective (by Roman provinces), and give the evidence of a political, juridical and sociological process.<br>

Abstract: Im Laufe der „nationalen Sattelzeit“ (Ute Planert) wurden Nationskonzepte zunehmend naturalisiert. Die Literaturgeschichte spielt dabei eine wesentliche Rolle. In drei Schritten verfolgt der Aufsatz den Transformationsprozess des nationalen Denkens im Kontext des sich wandelnden Naturbegriffs: Zum einen wird die nationale Wettkampfrhetorik im sog. deutsch-schweizerischen Literaturstreit skizziert, um demgegenüber die vormerklich funktionale Bedeutung des Nationalen und Nationalcharakteristischen in den Poetiken Gottscheds, Bodmers, Breitingers und Schlegels gewahr zu werden. Ein Blick auf die ‚Nationalidyllen‘ der aufgeklärten Hermannsdichtung zeigt, wie Natur und Nation trotz eines rationalen Naturbegriffs und in den Grenzen aufgeklärter Poetik als Einheit dargestellt wurden und so das Bildreservoir für spätere Generationen entstand. Die Wendung zu einem organologisch-dynamischen Naturdenken um die Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts ermöglichte eine weit intensivere und scheinbar substantialisierte Verbindung von Natur und Nation, die sich schließlich auch in den Gärten und Parkanlagen der höfischen Gesellschaft niederzuschlagen begann. In the course of „nationale Sattelzeit“ (Ute Planert) concepts of nation were increasingly naturalized – a development in which the history of literature plays an important role. This essay traces the process of transformation of national thinking in the context of the changing concept of nature in three steps: Firstly, it sketches the national rhetoric of competition of the so-called German-Swiss controversy, in order to highlight the mainly functional meaning of the national and the nationally characteristic in the poetics of Gottsched, Bodmer, Breitinger and Schlegel. Secondly, a closer examination of the national idylls of enlighted Hermann literature shows how – despite a rational concept of nature and within the limits of enlighted poetics – nation and nature were depicted as a unity and created a common reservoir of images for later ~<br>

James verweist neben Helmholtz, Wundt, Schopenhauer und Zöllners Über die Natur der
Cometen auf Herbert Spencer: Psychology. 3. Aufl. 1882, part 6, chaps. 9, 10, sowie auf Al-
fred Binet: Psychologie du raisonnement, chaps. 3, 5, und auf Eduard v. Hartmann: Philoso-
phie des Unbewußten (1869). Bd. 1, S. 304, 289; Bd. 2, S. 218 f in der 12. Aufl. Leipzig 1923.
Hartmann stützt sich vor allem auf Wundt.

G. Stanley Hall: The Muscular Perception of Space. In: Mind. Nr. 12 (London 1878),
S. 433-450. Der Wundt-Schüler Hall bildet u. a. mit diesem Aufsatz eine Brücke zwischen dem
deutschen Diskussionskontext (Hall bezieht sich auf Schopenhauer, Wundt, Exner, Vie-
RORDT u. a.) und dem Pragmatismus, dem er selbst zu dieser Zeit (nach Teilnahme am berühmten
„Metaphysical Club") nahesteht, wie seine (allerdings nicht kenntlich gemachte) Anlehnung an
Peirce (s. S. 446) beweist.
Nur en passant ist hier darauf hinzuweisen, daß auch Peirce sich des Theorems vom unbewußten
Schluß (im Anschluß an Berkeley) bedient. Für Peirce ist selbst die einfachste Wahrnehmung
Produkt eines unbewußten Schlusses bzw. einer Assoziation von Ideen, die in der Form vonstat-
ten geht, daß ein Urteil ein anderes Urteil hervorruft, von dem es das Zeichen ist. Peirce akzep-
tiert dabei das Modell einer kausalen Affektion der Sinne durch eine Welt I („brate facts"), die
Nervenreizungen und einen durch sie veranlaßten Schluß bzw. „something within the organism
which is équivalent to the syllogistic process" auslösen. Peirce zögert nicht, von Prämissen „des
logischen Prozesses der Natur" zu sprechen, die freilich nicht in den „Wahrnehmungstatsachen"
selbst liegen sollen. Vgl. Charles S. Peirce: Schriften zum Pragmatismus und Pragma~<br>

Abstract: En 1906 los "cabezas de familia" de cinco comunidades indígenas le pidieron al abogado Wistano Luis Orozco que los representara en sus pleitos legales por la defensa de sus tierras. Parte de la estrategia legal fue escribir un memorial de los agravios experimentados y dirigirlo a Porfirio Díaz. El memorial y el proceso judicial que desencadenó ejemplifican cómo los actores sociales daban forma a la cultura política en los ámbitos locales, estatales y nacionales, a finales del porfiriato. In 1906, the heads of household from five indigenous communities asked the lawyer Wistano Luis Orozco to represent them in their legal battle for the defense of their land. Part of their legal strategy was to prepare a written statement detailing their grievances and addressing it to Porfirio Díaz. The written statement and the legal process it sparked exemplify how social actors gave form to political culture at the local, state and national level towards the end of the Porfiriato.<br>

Abstract: Intensive care and the intensive care techniques in use have considerably changed our attitude towards death and dying –a process that had already been medicalized and professionalized. This study of four intensive care units (ICUs) in France and Britain brings to light the reality of death-related practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relations and personal experience. Study results strongly suggest that the end-of-life decision is a genuine social construction: far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by extremely heterogeneous types of logic. This study shows that patient's death in an ICU is more dependant on the organization and culture of the ICU than on patient's own wishes or those of close relatives.<br>

Abstract: This study is based on 150 interviews carried out in three countries among individuals of working class origin who have experienced very rapid social advancement. My approach consists of three stages. First, I establish a typology of the many forms taken by attempts to rehabilitate their working class origins among those interviewed. Second, I draw upon this typology to open up avenues for reflecting on what makes it possible to present working class origins as a resource. In this respect, it would seem that the narrative skill with which this experience is recounted – a matter of genuine social competence – constitutes a decisive factor. The conception of working class origins as a resource is above all permitted by a process of mystification which seeks to obscure the fact that this value is the product of an effort of self-narration. Third, I take a comparative approach to show that such individual strategies of narration remain extremely contingent on the cultural specificities of the countries in which they take place.<br>

Abstract: Environmentally we seem to be both the victims and the perpetrators of a type of bait and switch: lured into the discussion by one set of intuitions, our interests become redescribed in terms that are intellectually more respectable. Our deepest concerns with the environment are converted into foreign discourses, as we strain to make the languages of science, economics, and interest group politics express our intuitions. The circumscription of environmental philosophy within environmental ethics is one manifestation of this process of bait and switch. 'Corrosive Effects' critiques this process through a case study of acid mine drainage-water pollution resulting from mining activities. An analysis of acid mine drainage reveals the metaphysical and theological roots of many of our environmental problems.<br>

Les notions de l'oubli et du retour mises en exergue sur la Route par les deux Arbres éponymes montrent comment cet itinéraire, à la fois monumental et rituel, devrait permettre aujourd'hui à une histoire tragique de se « racheter » sous forme de discours mythique. Dans les diverses versions de ce mythe, où un lien mémoriel partagé entre oubli et retour est raconté et donné à voir, les récits locaux de l'esclavage font surface en se métamorphosant dans l'actualité patrimoniale et politique de la situation. De tels récits n'adhèrent pas pourtant aux diverses rhétoriques internationales et nationales, officielles et diasporiques, prônant, en quelque sorte, une pacification et une démocratisation de l'histoire. Since the early 1990s in Benin, the institutional process of connecting through memorials the past of slavery and the practices of voodoo has been highlighted by the Ouidah 92 Festival and the launching, under the auspices of Unesco, of the intercontinental itinerary of the Slave Route. Two eponymous trees on this road draw attention to the concepts of oblivion and return, thus showing how, thanks to this monumental and ritual itinerary, a tragic history should be able to « redeem » itself in the form of a mythical discourse. In the various versions of this myth, which tells about and visually presents a shared link between forgetting and remembering, local accounts of slavery rise to the surface while being metamorphosed in the patrimonial and political relevance of the situation. Such accounts do not adhere to international or national forms of rhetoric, whether from officials or from the diaspora, that tend to advocate a pacification and democratization of histor~<br>

Abstract: The process of positivization taken as an explication and application of normative
principles needs to be sharply distinguished from a supposed général process of disclosure of
norms, a sort of évolution and progression of the human spirit such as one finds in German
romanticism and to some extent still also in Kuyper and Dooyeweerd. See ]. Klapwijk,
"Verschuiving van normen en historistische filosofie," 36-40. Explication and application go
hand in hand. In the idea of progressive disclosure, however, the notion of contextualization
— the application of norms to spécifie situations — grows vague. Because the conditions of
human life undergo unremitting change, the process of positivization requires resumption
time and time again. Cf. S. Griffioen and J. Verhoogt in Norm and Context, 13; see also the
conclusion of the present essay.<br>

Abstract: Steen observes: "Dooyeweerd intimates that reality as it exists through temporal be-
coming and supra-temporal generation had a pre-existence in the Spirit of God; it exists as
created, as finished creation. It is this finished existing creation that now becomes in the great
becoming process." (Structure, p. 66f., cf. p. 52f.) One might wish to ask, then: What is the
supra-temporal existence of the soul? (On the concept of aevum, or created eternity, in
Dooyeweerd, see his "Het tijdsprobleem en zijn antinomieën op het immanentie-standpunt,"

such a physical structure — is opened-up by the biotic subject function of the bird.<br>

Abstract: 'Emergence' is meant in the sense that in the course of evolution structures sponta-
neously developed that, compared to existing structures, are conceptually or ontically of a
qualitatively different order. Within the continuity of the evolution process, then, something
new emerges. Stafleu is no evolutionist in the sense that evolution theory is his worldview; he
does adhere to the theory of evolution. As he sees it, systematic reformational philosophy has
concerned itself far too little with the issue of evolution. Stafleu holds that evolution is often
mistakenly taken to mean that the emergence of new structures, biotic structures for example,
can be explained via the laws for existing structures, in other words, by physical-chemical laws.
Approached in this way, the irreducibility of the modal aspects is at issue (the classical
objection from the side of reformational philosophy). The problem however dissolves entirely
as long as law and that which is subjected to it are not mixed. The laws for new structures are
not themselves a product of evolution; they become operational once the situation is ready for
them.<br>

Abstract: According to Hendrik van Riessen's (1967) analysis secularization owes its success to an
'effective semblance' ('werkzame schijn') of being an autonomous process that cannot be
stopped or reversed; see also Griffioen (2008, 80-81). The absence of alternatives I am dealing
with here is another illustration of an 'effective semblance'.<br>

Abstract: On a souvent décrit la modernité en la rapportant à l'idée de sécularisation du politique : à la faveur de la « grande séparation » hobbesienne, le pouvoir serait devenu un lieu vide, dissocié de toute attache à la transcendance, privé même de tout contenu substantiel. Cette étude entend rappeler que la philosophie politique contemporaine ne s'est nullement accommodée de ce processus de déthéologisation : au cours des dernières décennies, son propre a bien été, en s'appuyant sur le constat des « déraillements » de la modernité, de vouloir reconstituer une forme de lien entre le politique et le religieux. Cette intention partagée s'est incarnée dans trois grandes architectures de sens. La première tient dans le paradigme du recouvrement : il s'agit ici, tout en adhérant le plus souvent aux institutions démo-libérales, de replacer le droit politique sous dépendance de la norme religieuse. La deuxième position s'agence, quant à elle, autour du paradigme de la substitution : on saisit le politique alors comme un objet d'investissement religieux. La troisième figure relève du paradigme de la délibération : attachée au principe d'indétermination démocratique, à distance donc de toute primauté du spirituel comme de toute religion du politique, elle se construit, quant à elle, autour du dessein d'articuler, dans l'espace de la discussion civique, les convictions séculières et les croyances religieuses. Dans son ordre propre, la philosophie politique confirme l'hypothèse de l'inscription de nos sociétés dans une forme de post-sécularité. Modernity has been often described via the idea of a secularization of the Political: by way of the hobsian "great separation", power would have become an empty space, dissociated from all attachment to transcendence, deprived even of all substantial content. This study whishes to remind that contemporary Political Philosophy hasn't accommodated with this process of de-theologization: along the last decades, what characterized it has been, f~<br>

Abstract: Les rapports entre islam et psychologie en Égypte sont ici étudiés sur le terrain, dans une association de conseil et de formation psychologique cairote dont les responsables revendiquent une expertise reposant sur un processus d'institutionnalisation de la psychologie plus que centenaire. Une seconde ressource normative invoquée au sein de l'association est la religion. En réponse à l'indétermination qui peut résulter de ces efforts de synthèse, les aspirations au statut de classe moyenne constituent le troisième élément à prendre en compte pour comprendre la façon dont ce discours psychologique évolue. Il est alors possible de s'interroger sur les influences extérieures s'exerçant sur la discipline, notamment à travers les objectifs thérapeutiques qui lui sont assignés. This article seeks to explore the links between Islam and psychology in Egypt, focusing on the example of a Cairo-based association proposing counseling and teaching. Its leaders claim an expertise based on a more-than-a-century-old process of psychological institutionalization. Religion is a second normative resource used by the association. To resolve the qualms resulting from these efforts to produce a synthesis between the two, a third element has to be taken into account: the life aspirations linked to the middle class status. Eventually, this case study provides an insight on the external influences that shape the discipline, notably in the light of the assigned therapeutic goals. Las relaciones entre islam y psicología en Egipto son aquí estudiadas en el campo, en una asociación de consejo y de formación psicológica cairota cuyos responsables reivindican una expertise que reposa en un proceso de institucionalización de la psicología más que centenario.

Abstract: The paper explores the meaning of conversion for African Christians in South Africa by looking at some of the indigenous terms that have populated the Christian vocabulary. The paper focuses on terms like
         ukuguquka, ukukholwa, ibandla, ikholwa, igqobhoka, inkonzo,andinkolo. These terms are found among people who speak Nguni languages. It shows how they were used in pre-Christian context and traces their evolution in Christian contexts. Research conducted in the Reformed Presbyterian Church, St John’s Apostolic Faith Mission, and Methodist Churches in Cape Town between 1997 and 2001 has indicated that conversion was not a simple religious process but involved diverse political, economic and social aspects. Conversion involved a transformation of an African Christian identity from the margins to the centre. It also involved extensive negotiation of what it means to be Christian through the translation of Christian content into an African idiom. The paper goes through various terms and how their original meanings were discarded for new ones.<br>

Abstract: Fieldwork is sometimes marked by experiences of frictions and frustration. Fieldwork with mobile street vendors in an African city may confront the fieldworker with the problem of locating the 'field' and attaining access to it, both spatially and temporally. As I will show by reference to my fieldwork with a group of shoe vendors on the streets of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the frictions that occurred at the beginning of my fieldwork nevertheless ignited a process of ethnographic knowledge-gaining that led me to understand the importance of temporality and rhythmicity for the shoe vendors' practices. In their active engagement with the spatio-temporal landscape of the city, the street vendors organised their practices as an experiential rhythm that unfolded as sequences of rising and subsequently declining cognitive and corporeal tensions. These rhythms did not flow smoothly, but were necessarily interspersed with disturbances and frictions by the rhythms of other pedestrians in the streets, whose attention the street vendors tried to attain.<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342982<br>
Date: 10 1, 1952<br>
Author(s): Shakespeare Jan R.<br>
Abstract: This essay on the much acclaimed critic Stephen Greenblatt deals extensively with the New Historicism he developed and for which he coined the name "Poetics of Culture." Contrary to many older interpretive methods and schools that tend to see historical and literary texts as autonomous entities, Poetics of Culture seeks to reveal the relationship between texts and their sociohistorical contexts. Cultural Poetics assumes that texts not only document the social forces that inform and constitute history and society but also feature prominently in the social processes themselves which fashion both individual identity and the sociohistorical situation. By means of an economic metaphor, Greenblatt explains how texts and other symbolic goods, by circulating in a society via channels of negotiation and exchange, contribute to the distribution of social energy, by which he means the intensities of experience that give value and meaning to life and that are also indispensable to the construction of self-awareness and identity. The beating heart, as it were, of this whole process of circulation is identified as a dialectics of totalization and differentiation, as a powerful social force that oscillates between the extremes of sameness and otherness. In several books Greenblatt has elaborated the various aspects of this Poetics of Culture, such as the circulation of social energy, the dialectics of totalization and differentiation, and the process of self-fashioning. This essay discusses some problems of this interpretive method and argues, in comparing it to a more traditional hermeneutics, that social energy, self-fashioning, and the earlier mentioned dialectic are only phenomena in Greenblatt's interpretation of texts and are not actual parts of sociohistorical contexts. Poetics of Culture, in spite of its radical claims, is a genuine hermeneutics operating in a more or less traditional vein.<br>

De este modo, mediante de la figura del obispo Verdín se pretende analizar cuáles eran los mecanismos que se articulaban para el nombramiento de los obispos, en los que destacaban la contribución que las familias hacían a este proceso. Y, al mismo tiempo, se comprobará la actuación beneficiosa que tenía para la familia el nombramiento del prelado. /// This work seeks to examine the role played by families in ecclesiastical careers. The case of Bishop Verdín was chosen as the basis to analize the mechanisms set in motion to appoint bishops, with particular focus on the contribution of families to the process. At the same time, the paper will show the benefits that families derived from the appointment of specific bishops.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>

Date: 4 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Harb Sirène<br>
Abstract: This article explores how Gayl Jones's "Corregidora" constructs, through the journey of its main protagonist Ursa Corregidora, a viable model for dealing with the painful legacy of slavery, oppression and haunting by the past. The process of self-redefinition in which Ursa engages is based on the reconfiguration of family and sexuality and the hybridization of her relationship to individual as well as collective narratives. After probing Ursa's complex psychological journey, the article examines the main elements mediating the reinscription of her life narrative into a broader context of métissage involving sexual and historical resistance, anchored in the story of Palmares as a Brazilian maroon community (quilombo). Finally, the article analyzes the implications and resonances of this model of revision/reclamation for Gayl Jones and her theorization of the interconnectedness of struggles against oppression in Brazil and the United States.<br>

Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>

Author(s): Schwartz Barry<br>
Abstract: Oneness refers to the convention of recognizing a single individual's performance and ignoring others, including those who may have performed as well. Although oneness is an adaptation to cognitive deficits, it cannot be explained by them. If long-term and working memory were more capacious, society's need for ideals to establish realm-specific standards and meanings would tend to limit recognition and renown to one individual. The apotheosis of Rosa Parks is a case in point. Her celebrity and the obscurity of others who risked and accomplished more than she are two aspects of the same social process. Revealing oneness to be a social imperative, this case study leads to a broader understanding of collective forgetting.<br>

Author(s): Pagis Michal<br>
Abstract: Drawing on G. H. Mead and Merleau-Ponty, this paper aims to extend our understanding of self-reflexivity beyond the notion of a discursive, abstract, and symbolic process. It offers a framework for embodied self-reflexivity, which anchors the self in the reflexive capacity of bodily sensations. The data consist of two years of ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews of vipassana meditation practitioners in Israel and the United States. The findings illustrate how bodily sensations are used as indexes to psychological states, emotions, and past experiences, while constant awareness of embodied responses is used as a tool for self-monitoring. The paper follows the interaction between discursive and embodied modes of reflexivity and the attempt to shift from one mode to the other. I suggest that currently popular practices of embodied awareness, from meditation to yoga, are based on embodied self-reflexivity and are part of the postindustrial culture of self-awareness.<br>

Author(s): Miller Ann<br>
Abstract: Cet article aborde un aspect du processus d'interprétation de la vie religieuse ou cloîtrée amorcé au sein des communautés religieuses catholiques romaines dans les années '70. On avance que, durant cette période de transition, on a fait l'expérience d'un rejet massif du concept de "cloître" en tant que clôture au sens physique, en soulignant le fait qu'il y avait là plus qu'une simple modification de la pratique communautaire, axé sur une réalité transcendante de caractère utopique qu'on aurait voulu orientée en direction d'une expérience communautaire de caractère profane. En fait, ce type de rejet apparaît comme une transformation du concept de "cloître," ne niant point le fait de la continuité au niveau de l'identité communautaire. Les religieuses catholiques romaines ont eu recours à deux images de pointe: la fiancée éternelle du Christ et le clown, ou bouffon, du monde profane. /// This paper examines one aspect of the interpretive process undertaken by religious communities of North American Roman Catholic sisters in the 1970s, or the redefinition of cloister. It is suggested that during this transitional period, widespread rejection of the concept of cloister as physical enclosure was more than a mere illustrative shift away from a communal paradigm stressing utopian transcendence, and toward a communal paradigm identified as profane. In fact, this rejection signaled a transformation in the concept of cloister that allowed for continuity in communal themes of identity across contrasting paradigms. To effect this transformation, Roman Catholic sisters contrasted two liminal images: the transcendent Bride of Christ, and the profane clown.<br>

Abstract: A partir d'une étude menée en avril 2003 auprès de trois ONG guatémaltèques impliquées dans le processus de paix, cet article cherche à interroger les registres dominants en ce qui concerne les modalités de réconciliation de pays ayant connu la guerre. En étudiant les registres locaux de la reconstruction du "vivre-ensemble", l'économie morale et politique dans laquelle ils s'inscrivent, et les champs du discours auxquels ils renvoient, je veux montrer les limites que pose un contexte encore répressif aux approches et pratiques actuellement en vogue dans le domaine de la paix et de la réconciliation. /// Based on a study conducted within three NGOs involved in the Guatemalan peace process, this article interrogates dominant discourses and practices upon which strategies of reconciliation in postwar countries are based. Examining local idioms of the reconstruction of the principle of "living together," and in particular the moral and political economy in which these idioms are embedded and the discursive fields to which they refer, enables us to identify the obstacles that a repressive political context may impose on processes of peace-building and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against the all too common dichotomy of globalization into a process of homogenization or a process of significant diversification. The paper seeks to bridge this dichotomy by arguing for the relative autonomy of culture with respect to global political-economy, for the plurality of voices that constitute ongoing social interaction, and for a vision of actors operating in fields of power that position human agents differentially. The essay makes use of world systems theory to illustrate the merits and problems of global analysis while focussing on the ethnographic examples of French and Michigan wine growers. /// L'article s'inscrit en faux contre la vision dichotomique et récurrente de la mondialisation selon laquelle il s'agit soit d'un processus d'homogénéisation, soit d'un profond processus de diversification. L'article cherche à surmonter cette dichotomie en soutenant l'existence d'une autonomie relative des cultures face à l'économie politique mondiale, d'une pluralité des voix qui constituent les interactions sociales en cours et d'une vision qui situe les acteurs au sein de cercles de pouvoir qui leur imposent des positions différentielles. L'essai se sert de la théorie des systèmes-monde pour illustrer le bien-fondé et les défauts des analyses de niveau mondial. Il met l'accent sur des exemples ethnographiques de viticulteurs de la France et du Michigan.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i25654803<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Passos José Luiz<br>
Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Author(s): Wittgenstein John L.<br>
Abstract: One of the most interesting potential contributions of culture research lies at the intersection of the study of culture and the study of power. At this intersection lies a process of communication in which interested actors present particular understandings of the world in the hope of creating or sustaining preferred patterns of social relations. In this processes, groups and individuals struggle to create and disseminate cultural forms that support preferred patterns of power and dominance. This article presents a methodology, critical hermeneutics, useful in analyzing these attempts. To underscore the usefulness of the approach, we applied the method to a corporation's image advertising campaign, a set of texts intended to restructure the corporation's image and reframe a set of issues in a way favorable to it.<br>

Abstract: The optimistic assessment that the future of classical music will be dominated by Chinese (or Asian) artists motivates a re-evaluation of twentieth-century music in the context of "reflexive" cultural globalisation. The term classical music itself is inappropriate when describing the complex intercultural foundation of the past century of art music in East Asia. Drawing on theories by Ricœur, Taylor, Bhabha, and Samuels, "alterity" and "narrativity" are introduced here as key concepts for an interpretation of works that combine Chinese and European instruments or sounds from the 1930s until the present. Earlier concepts of musical narratives approaching alterity and interlinkage of Asian and Western musical discourses such as reform (Liu Tianhua), coexistence (Yamada Kōsaku, Hashimoto Kunihiko), integration (Shi Yongkang, Chinese "conservatory style"), and individualization (Takemitsu Tōru) were closely related to socio-political processes in East Asia. Recent compositions that employ bicultural instrumentation exhibit more specific and reflexive forms of musical narrativity; in these, four modes in which gestural types and structural processes intersect can be discerned: interaction (Chen Xiaoyong), polarity (Tan Dun), stratification (Zhu Jian'er), and hybridity (Chaya Czernowin). Cognitive constraints in the listening process might limit the communicability of several aspects in these narrative concepts.<br>

Lo más valioso de estos aportes es que son fruto del trabajo con los propios pobladores de Vicos, que durante un año se embarcaron en un intenso proceso reflexión y diálogo intergeneracional en el marco de una investigación participativa enfocada en las memorias locales del pasado comunal, y las implicancias de ese pasado para el presente y futuro de Vicos. Además de presentar a la Comunidad de Vicos, los antecedentes del Proyecto Perú-Cornell y el marco teórico y metodológico del proyecto de investigación participativa, este artículo ofrece una selección de testimonios de los pobladores de Vicos así como algunas reflexiones a modo de conclusión. Particularmente, destaca el potencial de los procesos colectivos de reflexión sobre el pasado como mecanismos de consolidación de la identidad y subraya la importancia de incluir a los actores locales en la reflexión y análisis de su pasado, no como «datos» o testimonios aislados, sino como productores de sentidos sobre ese pasado.

Abstract: Los historiadores porfían en encontrar la verdad y defender la libertad de interpretarla. Las diversas «verdades» conllevan la construcción permanente de la historia, para lo cual nos vemos en la necesidad de insistir en la inagotable búsqueda de los rastros y restos del pasado. Tanto historiadores como historiados, se encuentran en la misma condición de recordar acompañados. Ello nos compele a saber escuchar para entender las formas de olvido y contribuir a que la memoria aflore y estimule el ejercicio mnemotécnico. Como advertía Frances Yates, la memoria es un arte, y por tanto, el historiador asume que frente al el proceso destructor del olvido, la historia logra reconstruirse, siempre y cuando exista una memoria que perviva. Historians insist on finding truth and defending the freedom to interpret it. The different «truths» entail the permanent building of history, to which end we need to keep endlessly on looking for traces and remains of the past. Historians, as well as their subjects, find themselves in the situation of remembering accompanied. This compels us to know how to listen to forms of oblivion and to contribute to bring memory to the surface and stimulate the mnemonic exercise. As Frances Yeats warned, memory is an art, and therefore the historian assumes that, before the destructive process of oblivion, history achieves its reconstruction as long as there is a memory surviving.<br>

Abstract: Tras el fin del régimen del apartheid en Sudáfrica, la Comisión Verdad y Reconciliación, creada durante las negociaciones que llevaron al traspaso de poder, fue un instrumento decisivo para la transición pacífica a la democracia. Si esta forma negociada de compartir el poder entre enemigos acérrimos cogió por sorpresa al mundo exterior, este segundo proceso provocaría una sorpresa todavía mayor: la Comisión Verdad y Reconciliación fue un desenmascaramiento no judicial, no político y sin represalias de los perpetradores de la época del apartheid, y generó un proceso de amnistía sin precedentes. Este ensayo explica cómo funcionó dicho proceso y cómo se enmarcó en una nueva concepción de la justicia, arraigada en la confesión voluntaria por parte de los perpetradores y en una retórica reparadora de los relatos personales. Defiende que los perpetradores son, paradójicamente, el lugar antropológico donde asentar los cimientos de la democracia. After the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa, one fundamental instrument for a peaceful transition to democracy was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, agreed upon during the negotiations that lead to the handing over of power. In the same measure as such negotiated power sharing between bitter enemies took by surprise the outside world, this second process was to provoke an even greater surprise: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a non-judicial, non-political, non-retaliatory exposure of apartheid-era perpetrators, and created a unique process of amnesty. This essay explains how the amnesty process operated and how it was framed by a new conception of justice, rooted in voluntary disclosure by perpetrators and a restorative rhetoric of personal narratives. It argues that perpetrators are paradoxically the anthropological site for a democratic foundation.<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how, in a southern Irish setting, differences based on the historic struggles between Protestantism and Catholicism are perpetuated and communicated. It outlines the background and identifies modes of speech indicating unexamined assumptions grounded in the collective memory of the past. It analyses the ways in which the irruption into everyday communication of this emotional legacy reproduce difference, and examines Protestant perceptions that Catholics see them as incapable of possessing an authentic national identity. It shows how the process results in Protestant exclusion from the imagined nation and the category of 'Irishness'.<br>

Abstract: Intrinsically linked with the process of Modernity, the term «World System» reveals an evident secular dimension which derives mainly from the well-known sociological approach established by the Weberian thesis of
            «Weltentzäuberung»It implies a distinction between political [secular] and religious power, which establishes other parallel dichotomies between the public and the private power spheres, as well as between the profane and the sacred realms. But this typology —though useful and in fact essential in analytical and synthetic terms— is not completely suited to the «real» and effective state of the world. This actual world shows that the political and religious realms are deeply intertwined and that they build an effective net of interests, values, mutual agreements and disagreements, sometimes complementary and sometimes confronted, but in any case related. This situation emerges as a consequence of a process of historical construction.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire sociale se détourne aujourd'hui des approches quantitatives mises en œuvre par l'histoire économique et sociale, pour s'interroger sur la construction des entités collectives que sont les «classes», les groupes», les «communautés». Cet article apporte une contribution à cette entreprise, en s'appuyant sur l'exemple de l'histoire des réfugiés politiques en France. La sociologie politique et juridique de Max Weber est mobilisée pour mettre en valeur l'importance sociologique de la différence entre «catégories» et «groupes» sociaux. Le processus de catégorisation juridico-administrative est analysé à partir de sa double dimension: opération de classement qui vise à créer une catégorie «sur le papier», mais aussi, et dans le même temps, opération d'identification des ayant droit grâce à laquelle la catégorie abstraite devient véritablement une catégorie sociale. Today, social history has turned away from the quantitative approaches used by economic and social history in questioning how collective entities such as "classes", "groups" and "communities" are constructed. The article contributes to this effort through the example of political refugees in France. Max Weber's political and legal sociology is called upon to highlight the sociological importance of the difference between social "categories" and "groups". The process of legal and administrative categorisation is analysed on the basis of its two-fold dimension: the operation of classifying aimed at creating a category "on paper" and the simultaneous operation of identifying those entitled to political refugee status, thereby turning the abstract category into a genuine social category.<br>

Author(s): Desrosières Alain<br>
Abstract: Dans le cadre du séminaire Bonheur et Travail qui a débouché sur une enquête de l'Insee, Céline Bessière et Frédérique Houseaux ont pu « suivre des enquêteurs » et tirer de leurs observations de terrain quelques conclusions sur la production de données statistiques. Une passation mouvementée du questionnaire auprès d'un salariéagricole agricole montre l'importance de la situation d'enquête ainsi que celle des malentendus sur les mots utilisés. Les auteurs proposent de s'appuyer sur ces «ratés» de la relation d'enquête pour mettre en lumière le rôle souvent oublié de l'enquêteur. Elles suggèrent enfin de rapprocher enquêteurs et concepteurs et d'utiliser les données produites en gardant à l'esprit le travail de traduction qui a présidé à leur fabrication. Christian Baudelot et Michel Gollac en tirent la conclusion qu'il faut «faire avec» et refusent de renoncer aux gains de connaissance qu'apportent les enquêtes statistiques. Ils plaident qu'à condition de ne pas s'y enfermer, on peut les utiliser pour combattre l'ethnocentrisme même qui a pu présider à leur recueil. Florence Weber s'interroge sur la nature de l'interaction entre enquêteur Insee et enquêté: «relation anonyme et formulaire d'enquête» se conjuguent pour la rapprocher des relations qu'entretiennent d'autres agents subalternes de l'État avec les administrés. En jouant sur la nature des questions posées, on déplace simplement le lieu où se produisent les malentendus, à la fois instructifs et constructifs. Enfin, Alain Desrosières se demande «à quoi sert une enquête». Si les mêmes critiques, formulées depuis des décennies, n'ont jamais fait obstacle à la répétition des enquêtes statistiques, c'est que leur enjeu n'est pas seulement cognitif mais aussi politique. Il faut donc restituer la visée d'usage des enquêtes et les moyens sociaux des produits et des énoncés statistiques. Within the scope of the Happiness and Work seminar that led to an Insee survey, Céline Bessière and Frédérique Houseaux were able t~<br>

Abstract: L'auteur porte un regard critique sur la construction d'un objet historique qui, pour retracer l'histoire des pratiques de lecture sur le long terme (des années trente à nos jours) et cerner les processus d'appropriation des textes lus en milieu ouvrier, a nécessité le recours à une démarche d'investigation en histoire orale. Il aborde donc les grandes questions méthodologiques puis précise quelques résultats de l'analyse des discours en insistant sur leur apport fructueux pour l'histoire socioculturelle. The author takes a critical look at the construction of an historical object which, in order to relate the history of reading practices over the long term (from the 1930s to today) and bring to the fore the appropriation process of texts read in a working class milieu, meant undertaking an investigation involving oral history. It discusses the main methodological questions and then indicates some results of the analysis of the discourse, while insisting on their fruitful contribution to socio-cultural history.<br>

Abstract: Much the same is true of those 'Utopian realists' who, I suggested earlier, in this respect
at least make common cause with Dunn. Giddens, for example, insists that we must
'balance Utopian ideals with realism' given the extremely high-consequence risks of
contemporary social life, echoing Dunn's insistence on the complexity and risk inherent in
modernity, and Booth stresses that his utopianism is not an end-point Utopia but a process
Utopia, agreeing with Dunn's concern that the third task of political theory is to conceive
of realistic ways of getting from where we are to where we might, and should, aim to be.<br>

Abstract: An existential-phenomenological description of everyday consumer experiences of contemporary married women with children is offered. An idiographic case study provides a thick description of this phenomenon and illustrates the hermeneutic process used in the interpretation. Following the case study, three interpretive themes are presented as mutually related aspects of an experiential gestalt that is shaped by the contextual ground of participants' life-world situations. Viewed holistically, the thematic aspects exhibit several dialectical relations that can be understood in terms of the emergent meaning of free choice. The applicability of this experiential gestalt to other life-world contexts is discussed.<br>

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive firms are composed of multiple communities with specialized expertise, and are often characterized by lateral rather than hierarchical organizational forms. We argue that producing knowledge to create innovative products and processes in such firms requires the ability to make strong perspectives within a community, as well as the ability to take the perspective of another into account. We present models of language, communication and cognition that can assist in the design of electronic communication systems for perspective making and perspective taking. By appreciating how communication is both like a language game played in a local community and also like a transmission of messages through a conduit, and by appreciating how cognition includes a capacity to narrativize our experience as well as a capacity to process information, we identify some guidelines for designing electronic communication systems to support knowledge work. The communication systems we propose emphasize that narratives can help construct strong perspectives within a community of knowing, and that reflecting upon and representing that perspective can create boundary objects which allow for perspective taking between communities. We conclude by describing our vision of an idealized knowledge intensive firm with a strong culture of perspective making and perspective taking, and by identifying some elements of the electronic communication systems we would expect to see in such a firm.<br>

Author(s): Zigurs Marshall Scott<br>
Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization r~<br>

Abstract: The `puritan diary' has received attention from historians and literary critics with little exchange between the approaches. Placing the diary in the context of experimental Calvinist personal discipline reveals that the form emerged independently of the literature of practical divinity. Considering the practice as a `technology of the self' draws attention to the meanings of writing in a protestant context and encourages us to consider the cultural resources available to early modern protestants. Close reading of these texts suggests a greater degree of complexity than is often admitted and allows for a tension between different views of the salvific process. This tension between `open' and `closed' forms is helpful in understanding the religiosity of early modern protestants.<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on hermeneutics and dialogue, this article clarifies the distinctive contribution that pastoral and psychotherapeutic interventions have to make in the healing process. It is shown how the hermeneutical process discloses the meaning of events through the interpretation of texts that arise spontaneously in the lives of individuals and groups. Texts may range from individual fantasies and dreams to sacred histories recorded in scriptures. When the meaning of life events is explored in dialogue through symbolic texts, we term that process "dialogical hermeneutics." Effective dialogical hermeneutics requires the use of three techniques: (1) presence in the caring relationship, (2) dialogue toward meaning, and (3) offering alternative interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Le problème de la représentation du passé ne commence pas avec l'histoire mais avec la mémoire qui a le privilège de la reconnaissance intuitive et directe des images gardées de l'impression en nous de la marque du passé, avec toutes les difficultés liées à la fiabilité relative de la mémoire. Le problème chemine à travers tous les stades de l'opération historiographique: témoignage et archive, — explication/compréhension —, représentation narrative et rhétorique au niveau du texte final de l'historien. Entre la mémoire et l'histoire, l'ordre de priorité reste indécidable. /// The problem of the representation of the past does not begin with history, but with memory. Memory has the capacity to recognize intuitively and directly the images we keep of the impression the past makes on us, with all the uncertainties stemming from its questionable reliability. This problem concerns all stages of the historiographic process: testimony and archives — explanation/comprehension — narrative and rhetorical representation during the writing of the historian's final text. But one thing remains certain, it is impossible to give priority to either memory or history.<br>

Author(s): Motta Sérgio Vicente<br>
Abstract: A presente análise do conto "Seqüência", do livro Primeiras estórias, de Guimarães Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estruturação das "estórias" do autor. Esses enredos mobilizam, de uma maneira geral, o motivo da viagem e, de uma maneira particular, o percurso do eterno retorno. Nesse trajeto estrutura-se a travessia por um rito de passagem, cujo desfecho dá-se, com uma espécie de sobrelevação lendária, numa paisagem mítica. Para perfazer esse processo, o autor parte de um motivo da cultura popular que acaba amalgamado ao universo da tradição erudita, por meio de referências à tradição da história do gênero da narrativa e de seus códigos míticos. /// This analysis of "Seqüência", a short story from the book Primeiras estórias, by Guimarães Rosa, aims at showing a recurrent device used in the author's stories. These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.<br>

Abstract: International and national agendas are redesigning the terms of intellectual-property (IP) Laws to create cultural property for developing nations. Debates over IP and cultural-property "rights" or legal needs for "protection" are critical to anthropology's effort to reflect on how the production of knowledge, even culture itself, is variously construed to originate with, or "belong to," particular individuals, ethnic communities, or nation-states. We explore the implications of two Indonesian legal documents to show the disjunction between discourses of regional artists who describe the ritual exchanges, relationships, and transgenerational messages their arts shape and (inter)nationalists legal initiatives that bypass artists' concepts of process, access, and authority in an effort to disembed and control ritual-based expressions as products with exclusive owners.<br>

Author(s): McKnight Phil<br>
Abstract: With the portrayal of local resentment towards the massive influx of Silesian refugees after WWII in the GDR in his novel Landnahme, Christoph Hein expands the literary representation of history he began earlier in Horns Ende, again using the fictional small town of Guldenberg as paradigmatic for the GDR, extended here over time to include unified Germany. Bernhard Haber's epic, but unscrupulous struggle to overcome the will of his neighbors for him to fail provides the backdrop for Hein's depiction of how the past unavoidably writes the future and how the collective process of socialization shapes meanings and values. Using five narrators, Hein applies his earlier concept of social autobiography to trace historical developments in the acquired collective attitudes of Germans towards Gypsies, Poles, the handicapped, and African and Vietnamese workers left behind after unification, all of whom were subjected to the same abusive language and discrimination directed at the refugees.<br>

Publisher: El Colegio de México<br>
Issue: i27738655<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Duque Sonia<br>
Abstract: La autora se interroga acerca del significado de la expresión construir la paz en situaciones posteriores a la comisión de crímenes masivos. Subraya las dificultades específicas que plantea este tipo de circunstancias tanto a los analistas como a los profesionales que participan del proceso, y hace una serie de propuestas metodológicas que atañen al impacto de los crímenes masivos sobre la reconstrucción de las relaciones sociales y políticas en sociedades desgarradas por la guerra. Además, pone énfasis en la importancia de una mejor comprensión de estos procesos, con el fin de destacar los programas de asistencia más eficaces, ya que aquéllos surgen en situaciones sociopolíticas particulares. Al intentar una aproximación a este delicado tema, analistas y profesionales enfrentan dos retos. Primero, deben entender cómo pudo haberse llevado a cabo el crimen masivo. Segundo, deben identificar las posibilidades de paz existentes dentro de la sociedad afectada. Indudablemente, para que las reglas del juego social y político funcionen o, en otras palabras, para que todos los actores se interesen en unirse al juego colectivo, tales posibilidades no pueden ser ignoradas. La construcción de la paz debe incluir métodos locales que, en la mayoría de los casos, se han ido construyendo con el tiempo y han adoptado diferentes métodos provenientes de otras latitudes. /// The author questions the meaning of the expression "peace-building" in circumstances following the perpetration of massive crimes. She stresses the specific difficulties raised by these kind of situations to both analysts and professionals involved in the process, and puts forward a series of methodological proposals concerning the impact of massive crimes on social and political relations' reconstruction within societies torn by war. Also, the author underlines the relevance of having a better understanding of these processes in order to identify which assistance programs may be more effective, as those processes~<br>

Article Title: How to Become a Dominant French Philosopher: The Case of Jacques Derrida<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i329081<br>
Date: 11 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Lamont Michele<br>
Abstract: How can an interpretive theory gain legitimacy in two cultural markets as different as France and the United States? This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France.<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i27818847<br>
Date: 1 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): ESCHER ANTON<br>
Abstract: This article pleads for a pragmatic strategy of transcultural understanding as a dialogic concept of insight in social geographic research in the „Islamic Orient“. Transcultural understanding is interpreted as a process of assimilating different systems of meaning, norms, and values of subjects on the one hand, and discourses on how those systems fit together on the other hand (cf. Schwemmer 1996). Understanding is organized by scientifically working out common connections respecting and recognizing foreign codes. As it were, social geographic research needs to generate theoretical frames on a common basis in order to take the differences between cultures as a theme afterwards. In preparation of the argument, the concept of the „gelebten Raum“ (Baier 1996), and the post-modern understanding of space in social geography respectively (Claval 1999) is shortly presented. Additionally, a differentiation of the „Islamic Orient“ is outlined, as are the problems of understanding everyday life and social scientific problems of understanding agency.<br>

Abstract: Régulièrement proclamés partout dans le monde, la liberté d'expression et le pluralisme de la presse sont considérés comme des instruments de mesure démocratique. Seulement en France, où le journaliste porte dans son hérédité la tradition littéraire du débat d'idées, la diversité des opinions tend à se réduire. La déontologie professionnelle est associée à des dispositifs visant à établir l'objectivité – procédés linguistiques, recours systématique à des études sociologiques – dont les effets sont souvent de restreindre le jugement ou du moins de le conformer à des faits « scientifiquement » établis. L'observation, l'intuition, l'enquête sont ainsi supplantées par des protocoles qui agissent comme des écrans dans la démocratie d'opinion. Alors même que l'on continue d'accuser les médias de manipulation, la production endogène d'une pensée commune est une des raisons de sa perte d'influence. Generally claimed around the world, freedom of speech and press pluralism are considered as instruments of democratic measure. However in France where the journalist has in his heredity the literary tradition of ideologic debates, the diversity of opinions is lowering. Professional deontology is linked with rhetoric devices – linguistic process, resort to sociological inquiries – whose effects are often to refrein assesments or to produce them, according to « scientifically » set up items. Investigation, intuition, clearsightedness are overlapped by procedures which appear as screens in relationship to the public opinion. Even if the media are accused of manipulation, the endogeneous production of a commun thought is one of the reasons of their lack of influence.<br>

Publisher: National Council of Teachers of English<br>

Author(s): Cooper Marilyn M.<br>
Abstract: Individual agency is necessary for the possibility of rhetoric, and especially for deliberative rhetoric, which enables the composition of what Latour calls a good common world. Drawing on neurophenomenology, this essay defines individual agency as the process through which organisms create meanings through acting into the world and changing their structure in response to the perceived consequences of their actions. Conceiving of agency in this way enables writers to recognize their rhetorical acts, whether conscious or nonconscious, as acts that make them who they are, that affect others, and that can contribute to the common good. Responsible rhetorical agency entails being open to and responsive to the meanings of concrete others, and thus seeing persuasion as an invitation to listeners as also always agents in persuasion.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i27919226<br>

Author(s): Clairmont David A.<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of scholars' religious commitments on how they specify their object of study and select a method appropriate to its investigation. Using recent work on the notion of "bridge concepts" and "the analogical imagination" in the comparative study of religious ethics as a case study, this paper proposes persons in the process of intellectual and moral struggle with their own traditions as important and potentially fruitful objects for comparative studies of religion. Such a refocusing on the perennial appearance of persons navigating the troublesome yet profound histories of their religious communities offers important opportunities for cultivating openness, humility, and respect between the academic study of religion and those working critically from within traditions.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330145<br>
Date: 9 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Clifford James<br>
Abstract: Maurice Leenhardt's ethnographic work in New Caledonia spanned nearly half a century, from 1902-1948. The first part of this field research is described and analysed, as background to his later anthropological writings. Leenhardt's specific position as a missionary-ethnographer is discussed, its advantages and disadvantages weighed. A liberal missionary perspective is found, in this case, to be conducive to a portrayal of cultural process. Leenhardt's translation methodology and his relations with key informants are detailed. Transcription, the means by which ethnographic texts are constituted by more than a single subject, is speculatively extended to ethnographic practice generally. Field research may be seen as a collective, reciprocal endeavour through which textualised translations are made. This viewpoint calls into question common notions of description, interpretation and authorship in the writing of ethnography.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330183<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ohnuki-Tierney Emiko<br>
Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Author(s): Johannsen Jochen<br>
Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Abstract: Hugo Friedrich's use of mostly negative terms for the description of modern lyrics in Die Struktur der modernen Lyrik (1956) results to a large extent from a static concept of metaphor as substitution and from an implicit acceptance of the "given order of things." Though Friedrich asserts that this terminology is descriptive rather than pejorative, it impacts his interpretation of poetry. Based on Paul Ricoeur's Die lebendige Metapher(1986), this article reexamines one of Friedrich's examples, Rimbaud's "Marine." This poem provides in exemplary fashion a depiction of the metaphoric process of creative, poetic metaphors: transformation as a succession of destruction and production in the realm of land and sea. The tension and play between sameness and difference inherent in the metaphoric paradigm reveals in "Marine" a dynamic process rather than a stable order violated as Friedrich's concept of similarity suggests.<br>

Abstract: Peñas arriba engages in what Fredric Jameson, following
Northrup Frye, has identified as the hallmark gesture of romance: "[It] does not in-
volve the substitution of some more ideal realm for ordinary reality [...] but rather a
process of transforming ordinary reality" (110)<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i30245669<br>

Author(s): Glasner-Heled Galia<br>
Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Abstract: Computer-mediated communication (CMC) can spark students' interest and develop their cross-cultural communication skills. This article describes an on-going CMC cross-cultural project, "Images, Myths, and Realities across Cultures" (IMRAC), between French and American university students. The possibilities and limits of CMC are explored using the research of Claire Kramsch and Paul Ricœur, who provide a practical and theoretical framework in which to analyze student-authored writing. A three-fold articulation of self emerges as students participate in IMRAC. Through a process of mediation, the discussions on the chats offer students a praxis, a way of being that can contribute to making them more culturally literate citizens.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first- and third-person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue in ethnographies. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that hinges on splitting subject/object and process/product. Both splits are antithetical to dialogue in defining relationships between self and social life. A dialogic approach is developed through use of indexing in social distance, and discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life are traced out.<br>

Abstract: Secularization-a loosening of the religious hold on human conduct-is a multiple process. At one time animated from the exterior, it nowadays proceeds from Christianity's internal development. It can assume the form of a positive appreciation of the secularization of some activities (political, scientific, moral). It can operate even within the strictly religious domain: deritualization, desacralization, demythicization. These transformations are to be studied within the framework of the interactions between religion and civilization. /// La secularización, como retroceso de la empresa religiosa en las conductas humanas es un proceso múltiple.

Abstract: Alors que de nombreuses réflexions ont été menées concernant le recueil des biographies ou le recueil des données statistiques longitudinales, fort peu a été écrit concernant la mise en œuvre de leur interprétation. Or, l'unité de ce champ de recherche repose précisément, d'après les auteurs, sur les principes spécifiques d'intelligibilité du social produits par l'interprétation des parcours de vie. Dans cette perspective, ils subordonnent la démarche fondée sur la distinction entre approches objectivantes " balistiques " et approches fondées sur le sens construit par les acteurs à une démarche fondée sur l'élaboration de formes temporelles de la causalité. Ils distinguent trois modèles de base: un modèle archéologique, un modèle centré sur les cheminements, un modèle structurel. /// Deep thought has already been given to the filing of biographies and longitudinal statistics, whereas, little has been written about the actual use of these interpretations. According to the authors, unity in this field lies in the specific principles of social intelligibility produced by the interpretation of the paths of life. With this in view, the process based on the distinction between objectivizing " ballistic " approaches and those based on actor-built meaning are subordinated to a process based on the elaboration of temporal forms of causality. Three basic models are made distinct: an archaeological model, a model axed on itineraries and a structural model. /// Wenn einerseits zahlreiche Ueberlegungen zur Sammlung von Biographien oder statistischen Längsschnittsdaten vorliegen, so muss andererseits festgestellt werden, dass wenig geschrieben wurde zur Handhabung ihrer Interpretation. Die Einheitlichkeit dieses Forschungsfeldes beruht jedoch gerade, wie die Autoren meinen, auf den spezifischen Grundlagen der Vertändlichkeit des Sozialen, als Produkt der Interpretation von Lebenswegen.

Abstract: L'article analyse les processus d'imputation causale en cas d'accident dans des contextes industriels. Il s'appuie sur une enquête ethnographique menée auprès de plusieurs acteurs concernés: inspecteurs, ingénieurs, techniciens, magistrats. Il établit une distinction entre l'attitude morale, centrée sur la recherche des responsabilités, et l'innovation sociotechnique orientée vers la non-reproduction de l'accident et soucieuse de dissocier recherche des causes et recherche des responsabilités. L'article contraste la configuration des causes dans chacun des deux cas (processus de clôture de l'imputation, notion de cause retenue, degré de dissémination du réseau de causes). Il montre le statut différent des règles de droit dans chaque type d'imputation. Il indique comment s'articulent jugements de responsabilité et mise en réserve de l'attitude morale dans le traitement concret des accidents. /// This article analyzes the processes of causal attribution in the case of an accident in industrial contexts. It is based on a ethnographic survey carried out on several actors involved in this type of incident: inspectors, engineers, technicians, magistrates. It indicates a distinction between the moral attitude, centered around the responsibility of the accident, and socio-technical innovation which is concerned by the non-reoccurrence of the accident and the dissociation of responsibility and cause. The article contrasts the set up of the causes in each of the two cases (process to conclude the attribution, the notion of cause involved, the degree of dissemination in the cause network). It indicates the different status which regulations can have within each type of attribution. It shows how the different judgments of responsibility and the moral attitude when dealing with accidents relate to each other. /// Der Artikel untersucht den ursächlichen Zurechnungsprozess bei Unfällen im industriellen Umfeld.

Abstract: Desde hace una década, el concepto tradicional de "cultura" en antropología ha experimentado un nuevo auge tanto en las ciencias sociales como en el público en general. No obstante, en el discurso de la antropología, la teoría holística de la cultura fue abandonada desde hace mucho tiempo debido a problemas de variación entre las culturas, de poder, de cambio cultural y de acción individual. La parte principal del artículo formula un concepto de "cultura" como proceso inestable, abierto, de negociación del significado; si puede establecerse un consenso, dicho proceso conduce a una estabilización de los sistemas simbólicos y observamos los procesos correspondientes de una relación social cerrada al exterior [Weber]. La última parte analiza las repercusiones que dicho concepto de "cultura" (vinculado a una teoría del conflicto y del consenso) acarrea para el papel que tiene la antropología en el ámbito público y en el campo de las disciplinas científicas. /// Since a decade, a revival of the traditional anthropological concept of "culture" can be observed in the social sciences as well as in the larger public. In anthropological discourse, however, the holistic theory of culture has long been abandoned, because of the problems of intra-cultural variation, of power, of cultural change and individual action. The main part of the article develops an understanding of culture as an unstable, open process of negotiating meaning, which leads, if a consensus can be established, to a stabilization of symbolic systems and corresponding processes of social closure [Weber]. The concluding part discusses the implications that such a conflict-compromise oriented concept of "culture" has for the role of anthropology in the public sphere and in the field of scientific disciplines.<br>

Date: 2 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Shatzmiller Abdelmajid<br>
Abstract: Despite the increasing interest in translation in the last two decades, there has been no investigation of the translation of historiography and its transformation from one language to another. This article takes as a case study the translation into French of Ibn Khaldûn, the fourteenth-century North African historian. It considers specifically the translation done by William de Slane in the context of the colonization of Algeria. The Histoire des Berbères, the French narrative of Ibn Khaldûn that relates to the history of Arabs and Berbers in the Maghreb, has become since then the source of French knowledge of North Africa. It is upon that French narrative that colonial and post-colonial historians have constructed their knowledge of North Africa, of Arabs, and of Berbers. The article shows how a portion of the writing of Ibn Khaldûn was translated and transformed in the process in such a way as to become a French narrative with colonial categories specific to the nineteenth century. Using a semiotic approach and analyzing both the French text and its original, the article shows how colonialism introduced what Castoriadis calls an "imaginary" by transforming local knowledge and converting it into colonial knowledge. In showing this the essay reveals that not only is translation not the transmission of a message from one language to another, it is indeed the production of a new text. For translation is itself the product of an imaginary, a creation-in Ricoeur's words, a "restructuring of semantic fields."<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i282749<br>
Date: 1 1, 1947<br>
Author(s): Sund Brendan<br>
Abstract: In 1957, Francis Bacon rapidly painted a series of five numbered paintings after van Gogh's "Self-Portrait on the Road to Tarason," to fill an exhibition. They are exceptional in his work, both as to subject and in the way they are painted. A painter who regularly took reproduced images as his sources, he chose in this unique case the self-portrait of another artist, and used -- also uniquely -- methods evidently akin to those of 'action painting'. So selfhood and the practice of painting come into unusual conjunction in these works. Paul Ricoeur's attempt, in "Oneself as Another," to overcome the perennial self--other opposition, and his account of a constitutionally unstable self, lacking a 'core', are suggestive for discussion of the relationship between viewer and painting, specifically with reference to portraiture. He presents an alternative to the antinomial theories of the self which have long dominated criticism of visual art, theories according to which visual images mirror, and so crucially help to construct, an ego enclosed against the other; such a model is presumed in Ernst van Alphen's "Francis Bacon and the Loss of Self." Admittedly, this series of paintings is itself bound to invoke what Ricoeur terms 'hyperbolic' concepts of selfhood: van, Gogh, through his biographers, became the type of artist-as-genius; Minelli's biopic "Lust for Life," which Bacon probably saw, came out in 1956, and in the same year Jackson Pollock, prototypical 'action painter' died in a way that contributed to a comparable mythology. Against that, it is important to consider what Bacon does, and to notice the kinds of action, or interaction, tended to us as viewers. In context, the link with cinema assumes a different importance. Also crucial is Bacon's process of variation. Unlike philosophy, as Ricoeur shows, art can engage in play, freely varying all terms without a view to conclusion -- art experiments with the self. Bacon takes selfhood apart, recombines its elements; he~<br>

Publisher: University of New Mexico<br>
Issue: i286652<br>
Date: 4 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Yang Barbara<br>
Abstract: Beginning in the 1970s there has been a shift in cultural anthropological methodology from participant observation toward the observation of participation. During participant observation ethnographers attempt to be both emotionally engaged participants and coolly dispassionate observers of the lives of others. In the observation of participation, ethnographers both experience and observe their own and others' coparticipation within the ethnographic encounter. The shift from the one methodology to the other entails a representational transformation in which, instead of a choice between writing an ethnographic memoir centering on the Self or a standard monograph centering on the Other, both the Self and Other are presented together within a single narrative ethnography, focused on the character and process of the ethnographic dialogue.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a reconsideration of how similes and metaphors function in the literary reading process, and examines the effects of their respective logical and syntactic forms, their truth-functional status, their pragmatic force, their creative power in language, and their roles as part of a cumulative textual process. Through a close reading of Alfred Jarry's "Les Jours et les nuits," it tests aspects of the accounts of metaphor offered by Cooper, Davidson, Kittay, Lecercle, Le Guern, and Ricœur, and thereby questions our criteria for the classification of simile and metaphor.<br>

Issue: i288890<br>
Date: 7 1, 1975<br>
Author(s): FranchAbstract: The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the growth in Spain of a small corpus of woman-authored erotic fiction. Critical response to this literature has varied, with some critics seeing it as a valuable contribution in post-Franco Spain to the broader political projects of europeanization and secularization, and others regretting its inability to find a genuine non-patriarchal voice with which to celebrate women's sexuality. It is possible, however, to read these works as classic examples of how the obstacles to women writing might be overcome. This article examines two textual strategies employed, metaphor and irony, in short stories by Ana Rossetti and Mercedes Abad respectively, and concludes with the suggestion that this corpus represents the process of overcoming obstacles rather than the end product of having done so.<br>

Author(s): Sampon Emma<br>
Abstract: French writing inspired by Giacometti's art is not straightforwardly critical or ekphrastic. Texts by Ponge and du Bouchet considered here can be said to testify to his works, based on Ricœur's notions of testimony. They offer subjective testimonies to their relationships with Giacometti's pieces, and readers become witnesses to the visual experience and the texts. Du Bouchet writes performatively; his texts create spatial relationships. Ponge transforms Giacometti and his sculptures into figures of myth and writing, insisting that they show the viewer what it is to be human. For both writers, witnessing is a temporal process.<br>

Author(s): Jung Patricia B.<br>
Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Author(s): Hellweg Joseph<br>
Abstract: This article explores the hunting aesthetics of initiated Jula hunters of Côte d'Ivoire who call themselves dozos. It explains how their hunting aesthetic structures their relationship to Islam and the Ivoirian state. Although many Africans approach Islam in the context of tensions between local ritual traditions and modernizing Muslim reform, dozos approach Islam the way they approach the forests where they hunt, assimilating to both in order to tame them. They organize their hunting activities around an aesthetic centred on notions of sweetness and fullness; their contraries, difficulty and emptiness; and the process of mimetic transformation (shape-shifting) that mediates between these extremes. With these categories dozos assimilate themselves to and appropriate power from the forest to kill game. They also link themselves to pre-Qur'anic Muslim figures to legitimize themselves as Muslims. More recently, they tried to assimilate to the Ivoirian state to become a parallel police force. Stories of their tutelary spirit, Manimory, and the texts of their hunting songs, incantations, and epics encode diverse ways for dozos to relate to Islam, leaving room for dozos to eschew it as well. Their texts reveal a dynamic sense of history that defies classification in terms of tradition, modernity or postmodernity. /// Cet article examine l'esthétique de la chasse chez les chasseurs initiés julas de Côte d'Ivoire, qui se donnent le nom de dozos.

Author(s): Findlay L. M.<br>
Abstract: In "Ulysses" Tennyson adapts and refines the traditional techniques of ars memoria to create a poem that is vivid, specific, yet rich in allusion. Ulysses draws on present sensation and a well-stocked memory to help him face the future. This process is highly selective and manipulative, and Tennyson exposes its dangers by subtly appealing to a greater memory: that collective literary memory where Homer and Dante reign. Personal memory furnishes the immediate and attractive subject matter of the poem: its fabric of allusion implies and controls its larger and more cautionary meanings.<br>

Abstract: El objetivo del artículo es describir rasgos estructurales de la comprensión de metáforas mediante una comparación con la comprensión de otras culturas, tal como ésta ha sido comentada por Wittgenstein y Geertz. El fenómeno de estudio es la comprensión enfática (no básica) de metáforas fuertes (no de metáforas convencionales y muertas). La comparación entre ambos tipos de comprensión sirve para plantear y dar respuesta a tres preguntas desatendidas en la profusa literatura sobre la metáfora: 1) ¿En qué sentido nos sorprenden las metáforas fuertes? 2) ¿En qué sentido pueden ser profundas? 3) ¿En qué sentido hablamos de la riqueza de este fenómeno lingüístico? /// This paper sets out to describe the structural features of metaphor comprehension through a comparison with the process of understanding other cultures construed along the lines proposed by Wittgenstein and Geertz. The phenomenon under analysis is the emphatic (not basic) understanding of strong (not conventional or dead) metaphors. The comparison between understanding metaphors and cultures serves to raise and answer three questions that have been neglected in the vast literature on metaphors: 1) In which sense do strong metaphors surprise us? 2) In which sense can a metaphor be profound? 3) In which sense do we speak of the richness of this linguistic phenomenon?<br>

Author(s): Campbell Heather<br>
Abstract: The development of the intellectual basis for planning activity has been a slow and problematic process. This paper seeks to build on existing intellectual understanding to argue that future developments in planning thought must take questions of ethical value as their starting point. The paper is essentially divided into three parts. The first makes the important distinction between planning as a narrow set of regulatory practices and planning as an idea, or more particularly a long-enduring societal activity. It is the latter concept of planning that frames the discussion in the remainder of the paper. The second, in which the core of the argument is developed, explores the nature of planning as an activity; an activity that is centrally concerned with making ethical judgements about better and worse, with and for others, in just institutions. It is about an idea of value. The third section examines the implications of this perspective for planning as a subject of academic endeavour. The argument is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from the author's research.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: El cambio social, ¿es realizado por actores/agentes (=sujetos, individuales y supraindividuales), o bien por determinismos colectivos (como estructuras y sistemas)?, ¿o tal vez por una combinación cualquiera entre actores y mecanismos sociales? Las teorías sociológicas, desde el Ochocientos hasta hoy, se han dividido en dos grandes campos: a) Por un lado, han habido teorías que han adoptado un "paradigma olístico". b) Por otro, han emergido teorías que, juzgando las primeras como infectadas de determinismo, han elaborado un "paradigma accionista". Muchos autores han mezclado o combinado juntos ora una, ora otra de estas posturas sin lograr encontrar un punto de vista capaz de integrarlas o trascenderlas. El resultado es que, hoy, la mayor parte de las teorías oscilan entre el primer y el segundo paradigma, o bien tratan de comprender el cambio social a través de mezclas o "fórmulas combinatorias" entre las dos. La tesis del autor es que ni las teorías sistémicas (olísticas) ni las accionísticas (individualistas) ni sus combinaciones pueden encontrar una "comprensión adecuada" del cambio social. Ofrecen visiones parciales de la historia, que son insuficientes en tanto que comparten una carencia común: la idea de que la relación social sea un resultado (un efecto) de "otras" variables en juego, como las estructuras sociales o --por el contrario-- la subjetividad individual, o bien un determinismo en sí misma. Para comprender el cambio social se precisa de una teoría adecuada al carácter relacional de la realidad social, como realidad sui generis "hecha de" relaciones sociales. Se propone aquí un paradigma, denominado "relacional", según el cual el cambio social consiste en la "emergencia" de realidades sociales movidas por sujetos (individuales y colectivos) queestán en relación entre ellos en un determinado sentido. "Comprender" signifìca "relacionarse" con todo lo que tal relación (¡social!) significa y comporta. En la parte final se trata de ejemplificar las potenc~<br>

Abstract: La réanimation et les techniques employées ont bousculé notre rapport à la mort, déjà professionnalisée et médicalisée. L'étude de quatre services de réanimation, en France et en Grande-Bretagne, permet de faire apparaître la réalité des pratiques concrètes de la mort et de la replacer au cœur des relations professionnelles et des expériences personnelles. Au terme de ce travail, la décision de fin de vie apparaît être une véritable construction sociale : loin d'être purement objective et médicale, elle est conditionnée par des effets de contexte et par l'engagement des acteurs. La recherche d'autonomie et d'autorégulation professionnelle renforce l'ambivalence du processus de "mourir" déjà complexe puisque régi par des logiques très hétérogènes. La mort dépend plus de l'organisation et de la culture de chaque service que de la volonté du patient ou de ses proches. /// Intensive care units and their techniques have considerably altered our attitude towards death as well as the death process - a process that had already been professionalised and medicalised. This study of four intensive care units in France and Britain brings to light the reality of deathrelated practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relationships and personal experiences. Study results strongly suggest that the decision to end life is a genuine social construction : far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by numerous and heterogeneous logics. This study shows that our death depends more on the organization and the culture of the intensive care unit than on our own wishes or those of close relatives. /// Behandlung und technische Mittel in der Intensivstation haben unser Verhaltnis zum Sterben grundlegend verändert und es heute schon zu einer medizinischen Berufssache g~<br>

Publisher: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers<br>
Issue: i40010631<br>
Date: 3 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Svenaeus Fredrik<br>
Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Daniel, 2, 27-45), e a novidade absoluta do acontecimento de Cristo, que se espera vir a manifestar-se na pacificação terrena do processo histórico e na constituição duma comunidade universal segundo o Espírito. A tese, que só um estudo ulterior poderá demonstrar, é a de que a perspectiva do Quinto Império, em Vieira, será, ainda subsidiária das categorias dominantes no tempo dos quatro impérios, em que a experiência escatológica se refracta antropocentricamente pelas finalidades, e relações de poder, político-civilizacionais. /// Cette étude presente les présupposés théoriques et les tensions essentielles de Ia thématisation de Tidée de Cinquième Empire dans Ia Défense Auprès du Tribunal du Saint-Office, du P.

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique. On prend comme point de départ les présupposés phénoménologiques et ontologiques de sa philosophie, pour aborder successivement les questions concernant l'interprétation textuelle, l'imagination et la créativité, l'action, le temps et le récit, l'idéologie et l'utopie. Tout en reconnaissant un certain logocentrisme–un mélange de Logos et de réalité supposée–impliqué dans la solution de ces questions qui nous est proposée par l'auteur, on cherche à repenser le lieu entre le sens et le consensus, la cohérence et la question même de la violence. A cet effet, la derniére section établit une confrontation entre les positions défendues par Ricoeur et l'hypothèse de R. Girard sur le désir mimétique et la violence. /// This article presents Paul Ricoeur's most recent thought from the perspective of how sense is produced; in the process, possibilities and limits of the hermeneutical circle are discussed Using as a point of dep~<br>

Author(s): Ballard Chris<br>
Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Issue: i40018320<br>
Date: 7 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Swanson E. Burton<br>
Abstract: Making sense of new information technology (IT) and the many buzzwords associated with it is by no means an easy task for executives. Yet doing so is crucial to making good innovation decisions. This paper examines how information systems (IS) executives respond to what has been termed organizing visions for IT, grand ideas for applying IT, the presence of which is typically announced by much "buzz" and hyperbole. Developed and promulgated in the wider interorganizational community, organizing visions play a central role in driving the innovation adoption and diffusion process. Familiar and recent examples include electronic commerce, data warehousing, and enterprise systems. A key aspect of an organizing vision is that it has a career. That is, even as it helps shape how IS managers think about the future of application and practice in their field, the organizing vision undertakes its own struggle to achieve ascendancy in the community. The present research explores this struggle, specifically probing how IS executives respond to visions that are in different career stages. Employing field interviews and a survey, the study identifies four dimensions of executive response focusing on a vision's interpretability, plausibility, importance, and discontinuity. Taking a comparative approach, the study offers several grounded conjectures con-cerning the career dynamics of organizing visions. For the IS executive, the findings help point the way to a more proactive, systematic, and critical stance toward innovations that can place the executive in a better position to make informed adoption decisions.<br>

Author(s): Sidorova Anna<br>
Abstract: In this paper, we use concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to interpret the sequence of events that led to business process change (BPC) failure at a telecommunications company in the United States. Through our intensive examination of the BPC initiative, we find that a number of issues suggested by ANT, such as errors in problematization, parallel translation, betrayal, and irreversible inscription of interests, contributed significantly to the failure. We provide nine abstraction statements capturing the essence of our findings in a concrete form. The larger implication of our study is that, for sociotechnical phenomena such as BPC with significant political components, an ANT-informed understanding can enable practitioners to better anticipate and cope with emergent complexities.<br>

Abstract: El propósito de esta artículo es reconstruir itinerario de investigción, a través de los diferentes proyectos que lo componen y que fueron realizados en los diez últimos años, con el fin de develar cierta coherencia metodológica y teórica. Cada estudio de esta trayectoria se propone analizar varias facetas de la juventud, desde un punto de vista antropológico y sociológico. Los años de doctorado fueron dedicados a entender el proceso de construcción identitaria de los jóvenes pijos madrileños a través de sus usos y costumbres. Luego, un trabajo post-doctoral se orientó hacia la ano-rexia nerviosa y la feminidad en jóvenes de la ciudad de México. Tercero, un trabajo de campo en la Meseta Tarasca permitió el acercamiento y entendimiento de las "nuevas" representaciones y prácticas de algunos jóvenes acerca de su cuerpo y de su alimentación, así como de algunas lógicas familiares, desestructuradas y re-estructuradas por el hecho de la migración hacia Estados Unidos. Por último, se presenta un cuarto proyecto sobre "bulimia, sexualidades y género", inscrito en una propuesta global de estudio de las inversiones de la "valencia diferencial de los sexos". /// The author revisits her research itinerary, reviewing the different projects that compose work carried out in the last ten years. The aim is to reveal a certain methodological and theoretical coherence. Each study in this trajectory set out to analyze several aspects of young people's lives from an anthropological and sociological point of view. The PhD years were invested in researching the process of identity construction of the Madrilenian pijos (young people from middle an upper middle class) through their uses and customs. Postdoctoral work was focused on nervous anorexia and femininity in young women in Mexico City. Later on, fieldwork in the Tarascan Plateau in Michoacán state in Mexico enabled the author to approach and understand the "new" representations and practices of some young people concerning their bo~<br>

Publisher: Heldref Publications<br>
Issue: i40023288<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Hendry Petra Munro<br>
Abstract: The author suggests that all research is narrative. Resituating all research as narrative, as opposed to characterizing narrative as one particular form of inquiry, provides a critical space for rethinking research beyond current dualisms and bifurcations that create boundaries that limit the capacity for dialogue across diverse epistemologies. The contemporary bifurcation of research as either quantitative or qualitative, or as scientific or nonscientific, has resulted in a master narrative of research which assumes incommensurability across paradigms. The author weaves 3 questions through this research: (a) What is lost when narrative and science are constructed as opposing and incommensurable modes of inquiry? (b) How might scholars reconceptualize inquiry outside a binary framework that privileges science? and (c) In what ways can resituating all narrative as inquiry open spaces for dialogue across multiple epistemologies that is the heart of democratic inquiry? The author concludes by suggesting that narrative is not a method, but rather a process of meaning making that encompasses 3 major spheres of inquiry: the scientific (physical), the symbolic (human experience) and the sacred (metaphysical).<br>

Abstract: How can we understand the social impact of cognitions of a projected future, taking into account both the institutional determinants of hopes and their personal inventiveness? How can we document the repercussions, often contrary to intentions, "back from" such projected futures to the production and transformation of social structures? These are some of the questions to be addressed by a cultural sociology that attempts to look seriously at the effects of a projected future as a dynamic force undergirding social change. In this essay I discuss some of the reasons why the analysis of the future has been so neglected in sociological theory and research, and then sketch a possible framework for reincorporating it that specifies some of the cognitive dimensions of projectivity. In the process, I will show how a focus on future projections can help us make a link between cognition and action in a manner that has so far been neglected in the sociological literature.<br>

Abstract: Au moyen d'une analyse sémiotique de 14 entretiens réalisés auprès d'adolescentes à propos de la mode nous mettons en évidence les « bricolages » qui leur permettent d'élaborer des panoplies vestimentaires et de construire leur apparence et leur identité. Cette description permet de montrer que la consommation peut être considérée comme un processus de co-construction. Nous montrons les implications de ce travail vis-à-vis : de la construction de l'identité au travers de la consommation, la signification des objets de mode, des méthodes de recherche utilisées, des travaux sur l'expérience vécue des consommateurs, et des praticiens. Semiotics provides a useful base for interpreting 14 interviews with adolescents about fashion. Our analysis show the «bricolages» used by each participants to produce various looks and to develop a sense of personal identity. We suggest that our description is an example of consumption viewed as a co-construction process. Implications for previous works on personal identity and the meaning of fashion objects, research method, experiential aspects of consumption, and marketers are provided.<br>

Abstract: À partir de la scène de mise en patrimoine d'une machine sidérurgique, un haut fourneau de « l'ancienne » Lorraine industrielle, cet article propose une analyse des conditions d'émergence et de stabilisation d'une catégorie patrimoniale récente, le patrimoine industriel, autrement dit du traitement en monument des restes de la seconde industrialisation. La patrimonialisation de tels restes est tout entière déterminée par l'évaluation de leur « comportement » aux différentes étapes de la « chaîne patrimoniale » -connaissance/conservation/valorisation -qui instruit le monument historique.Pour autant ce processus contribue en retour à la mise en question de ce mode de traitement et à l'invention de nouvelles stratégies culturelles. A blast furnace in « formerly » industrialized Lorraine is being presented as a monument belonging to France's national heritage. The conditions are analyzed for the emergence and stabilization of a recent category for classifying what remains from the second wave of industrialization as part of this heritage. This process is fully determined by assessing the object's « behavior » during various stages (knowledge, conservation, treasuring) in the « patrimonial chain » leading to its classification as a historical monument. In feedback, this process leads us to raise questions about handling such sites in this way and inventing cultural strategies.<br>

Abstract: Les apports de Jean-Marie Floch au marketing sont nombreux. Cet article ne prétend nullement en rendre compte de façon exhaustive mais tâche plutôt de montrer combien les voies et pistes de recherche qu 'il a initiées ont été fructueuses pour l'ensemble de la communauté marketing et sont d'un recours très fréquent pour aborder les questions de signification. Comprendre le parcours generatif du sens, permettre l'analyse des récits de marque, inscrire dans le lieu de vente ou l'objet les attentes génériques des consommateurs, voici quelques unes des très précieuses idées développées par ce sémillant sémioticien. The contributions of Jean-Marie Floch to marketing are numerous. This paper does not pretend to cover exhaustively this domain but tries to show how the research avenues developed are fruitful for the entire marketing community and are frequently used in order to deal with questions that have to do with signification. Facilitating the understanding of the process of sense generation, allowing the analysis of brand stories, marketing through sales area designs or products the generic requirements of customers, those are some of the precious ideas developed by Floch.<br>

Abstract: Le temps est une dimension naïve de l'analyse sociologique. Peu de chercheurs se sont intéressés au fondement de nos représentations modernes du devenir, qui sont toutes coulées dans un même moule, celui de l'évolution orientée. Nous montrons qu'il s'agit là d'un arbitraire culturel, dont procèdent, par exemple, des discours rétrospectifs sur l'homme, comme l'histoire ou la cosmologie. Il est donc « temps » de critiquer les paradigmes de la continuité, et de développer une sociologie des formes où les devenirs des phénomènes sociaux sont conçus comme autonomes et spécifiques. Time is a naive dimension of social analysis. Few social scientists have concerned themselves with the basis of our modern representations of process (le devenir) which are all cast in a common mould, that of oriented evolution. This article seeks to show thai this is a « cultural arbitrary » , from which spring f. ex., retrospective discourses on man such as history or cosmology. So it is « time » to criticize the paradigms of continuity and to develop a sociology of forms in which the processes of social phenomena are conceived as autonomous and specific.<br>

Abstract: La première partie de l'article recueille, comme préalable nécessaire à une sociologie de l'éthique, les notions élaborées pour rendre compte de l'expérience éthique. La seconde partie traite de la reprise de ces notions dans les sociologies de Weber et de Habermas. Weber fait intervenir l'éthique dans le cadre de son explication de l'émergence de la société moderne. Habermas remodèle la théorie wébérienne en introduisant le concept d'activité communicationnelle et c'est à partir de là qu'il introduit l'éthique de la discussion. As a necessary preliminary to a sociology of ethics, the first part of this article is reviewing the various notions drawn up in giving an account of the developments in the field of ethics. The second part is devoted to the further examination of these notions in the sociological research studies carried out by Weber and Habermas. Weber is including ethics in the framework of his explanation of the way in which modern society has emerged. Habermas is adding a new element to Weber's theory through bringing in the concept of communicative process, which leads him to introduce the notion of an ethics of discussion.<br>

Abstract: A partir de la conception de la biographie développée par A. L. Strauss et de la philosophie du temps de G. H. Mead, trois niveaux d'organisation du temps de l'expérience biographique sont mis au jour. D'abord en examinant comment s'articulent l'irréversibilité du temps et le caractère partiellement indéterminé du passé. Toute restitution rétrospective de l'expérience biographique s'inscrit dans ce cadre. Ensuite, ce temps biographique, constitué dans l'après-coup au sein d'interactions avec autrui, se structure principalement autour des événements marquants, lesquels forment le plus souvent un calendrier privé. Mais, avant cela, ces événements ont leur temporalité propre liée à leur parcours sémantique : la constitution du sens de l'événement est ellemême un processus temporel partiellement contingent - la réduction du tranchant de l'événement ne va pas de soi - et la stabilisation d'un sens appropriable par la personne est la condition pour que l'événement qui « a été » ne « soit plus », que Von puisse tourner la page. Out of the conception of biographical time as developed by A. L. Strauss and G. H. Mead's philosophy of time, three levels for organizing the time of biographical experiences come to light. First of all, any retrospective reconstruction of a biographical experience involves examining how time's irreversibility is linked to the partly indeterminate nature of the past. Next, this biographical time, reconstructed afterwards through interactions with others, mainly takes shape around significant events, which usually form a private calendar. Previously however, these events had their own temporality linked to their semantic itinerary : the construction of an event's meaning is itself a partly contingent temporal process — reducing the cutting edge of an event cannot be taken for granted — and the stabilization of a meaning that the person can appropriate is the condition for the event that « was » to be « no longer » , so that one can be able to make af~<br>

Abstract: The lawyer's crucial role in the contractual process has not been adequately addressed. Transaction cost economics provides a promising approach for doing so, but does not fully account for the lawyer's motivations or intentions. To do so, a more comprehensive theory of human behavior is required. Husserl's phenomenology, specifically his analysis of the natural attitude, provides such a theory. This article describes the role of lawyers in drafting complex entertainment contracts and explains that role in terms of both transaction cost economics and phenomenology. It argues that the two explanations are consistent, but that phenomenology offers additional insights and more fully explains the lawyer's actions.<br>

Abstract: The thesis that the German dual system of vocational training as well as skilled labour in general are threatened by erosion is challenged in this article by theoretical arguments and empirical evidence from Norwegian studies. The question is discussed whether the 'erosion thesis' exaggerates the discontinuity of industrial organization principles, thus prematurely devaluating the productive potentials of skilled workers. The author points out that the presumption of an erosion process is based on a restricted concept of 'Beruf' (vocation) and of work organization. Rather than seeing 'process orientation' as an organizational principle that contradicts the concept of 'Beruf', the author argues that it could supplement professional responsibilities, thus extending and renewing the concept. He wonders whether the 'erosion thesis' sufficiently considers the criticism of the neo-classical view of economic behaviour, which was brought forward during the eighties. According to this criticism, the socialization and integration of skilled workers into a professional community can be seen as the well-working institutionalization of a 'practical professionalism' which also includes innovative and future-oriented capacities. Finally, a research perspective is sketched out regarding the future of vocational training and skilled labour.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: Différence, référence, communicabilité : trois mots-clés pour dessiner la structure originaire et élémentaire de la signifiance. Or, l'interrogation change de nature quand on la déplace du signifié vers le sens, puis vers la signifiance. Il ne s'agit ni d'une action, ni d'un événement, mais d'un processus. Trois conditions nécessaires : présence d'un matériel signifiant (sonore, graphique, électronique) ; aptitude à se référer à une réalité extérieure ; énonciateurs en relation binaire entre lesquels et pour lesquels les énoncés signifient. L'auteur examine les conséquences de leur considération groupée en philosophie du langage. Difference, reference and communicability are three key-words to outline the original and elementary structure of« signifying ». Now, the nature of philosophical interrogation changes when it shifts from the saussurian « signifié » towards the meaning, a fortiori towards signifying. It is neither an action nor an event but a process. Three conditions are necessary : the presence of specific material (whether acoustic, graphic or electronical) ; an aptitude to refer to an outside reality ; speakers standing in binary relationship. The writer examines the consequences of considering the constraints as gathered in a philosophy of language.<br>

Abstract: Cassirer faisait de la connaissance le point culminant du « processus d'objectivation de l'esprit » se révélant ainsi progressivement à soi-même à travers la spécificité de ses diverses configurations symboliques. Nous nous proposons d'élucider ici la loi de constitution propre aux sciences exactes à partir des principales figures de la physique moderne pour nous élever à une philosophie de la culture scientifique et dégager les principaux problèmes que pose sa réalisation comme « Weltbegriff ». Cassirer considered Knowledge as the terminating point of the « process of objectification » of human spirit that leads progressively to its self-consciousness through the differential specificity of symbolic forms. We are mainly concerned here with trying to clear up the constitutive law proper to exact sciences. Our analysis starts from the main figures of modern physics as its starting point in order to set our thought on a philosophy of scientifical culture and to draw the main problems related to its achievement as « Weltbegriff ».<br>

Abstract: La catégorie de « temporalisation » est omniprésente dans les textes fondateurs de la Begriffsgeschichte koselleckienne. Elle renvoie à la question générale de la temporalité humaine et au problème épistémologique des temporalités historiques en particulier. Elle constitue en outre, pour Koselleck, un cadre interprétatif fondamental de notre modernité politique. Ce texte revient sur ces différents problèmes en reconstruisant la « théorie générale de l'expérience historique » qui se trouve à l'arrière-plan. Un inventaire des usages analytiques de la catégorie de « temporalisation » est ensuite proposé. Par là même, le schème de la « temporalisation » apparaît comme un processus global traversant notre modernité politique, en interaction avec d'autres processus englobants, qu'il s'agit aujourd'hui de tenter de typologiser dans la continuité certes, mais au-delà du cadre koselleckien initial. Soucieux de faire apparaître, en les distinguant et articulant ensemble, les différents niveaux d'analyse mis en œuvre par l'entreprise même de l'histoire des langages politiques modernes, cet article tente de réengager le dialogue entre l'histoire (structurelle, culturelle et événementielle) et les sciences politiques en reconnaissant un statut causal propre aux idées politiques et religieuses modernes, à la philosophie politique et juridique moderne, à l'inertie des sémantiques historiques sur la longue durée : toutes choses qui ne peuvent être causalement, et partant disciplinairement, disqualifiées que parce que l'on part d'une vision étriquée et pauvre de ce qu'est l'expérience de l'histoire. The notion of 'temporalization' is one of the key concepts in the Koselleckian Begriffsgeschichte. It refers to the general issue of human temporality and more specifically to the epistemological problem of historical temporalities. In Koselleck's writings, it constitutes a fundamental interpretative framework for political modernity as a whole. This article returns to these different is~<br>

Abstract: Bien que de nombreux auteurs aient fait œuvre à la fois de sociologue et de théologien, il n'existe pas à proprement parler de « sociologie de la théologie ». L'objet de cet article est de proposer une relecture de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs afin de montrer que ce livre offre autant une étude de sociologie de la mémoire qu'une esquisse de sociologie de la théologie. Après avoir précisé en quoi on peut parler d'une étude de la « construction sociale de la pensée chrétienne » chez Halbwachs, on revient plus en détails sur la façon dont il analyse le mécanisme de production de l'orthodoxie théologique, puis sur la spécificité du regard que le sociologue porte sur les questions théologiques. Enfin, la conclusion est l'occasion de souligner ce que pourrait apporter la sociologie de la théologie à la sociologie en elle-même. Even if various authors contributed to sociology as well as to theology, nothing like a "sociology of theology" exists. The aim of this article is to offer a rereading of La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte by Maurice Halbwachs, in order to show that this book is not only a study of sociology of memory but also an outline of a sociology of theology. After having defined in what extent we can find a study of "the social construction of the Christian thought" in Halbwachs' work, we turn to the way he analyses the production process of the theological orthodoxy, and then to the specificity of the sociological point of view on theological questions. Finally, the conclusion gives us the occasion to underline what the sociology of theology could bring to sociology itself. Aunque varios autores han contribuido tanto a la sociología que a la teología, no se puede decir que existe realmente una "sociología de la teología". Este articulo propone una relectura de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs que pretende mostrar que este libro es tanto un estudio~<br>

Abstract: Début 1936, X., haut dirigeant de l'État-Parti, pressentant peut-être une disgrâce prochaine qui le conduira à la mort en 1937, s'exile en écriture. Pour autant, l'analyse proposée de son journal ne s'attache pas à décrire cette lente descente aux enfers qu'ont connue d'innombrables citoyens soviétiques au cours de cette histoire désorbitée. Elle tente de discerner divers « noeuds », lestés de paradoxes et sans doute constitutifs de la période : comment l'(il) logique de la Terreur peut être l'objet d'une appropriation par sa future victime ; comment cette même Terreur, via une déstructuration temporelle imposée à l'individu, lui dicte des formes narratives de soi ; et comment, ce faisant, l'individu en question est susceptible de reconquérir un « je ». In early 1936, probably sensing the eventual disgrace which caused his demise in 1937, an anonymous top party leader retreated into writing. The present analysis of this man's journal does not address the slow descent into hell experienced by so many Soviet citizens in those times gone mad. Rather it aims at discerning various predicaments laden with paradoxes and undoubtedly constituent of the period: how a future victim internalizes the (il) logic of Terror; how Terror dictates narrative forms of the self by causing a disruption of the individual's awareness of time; and how, in the process, the individual in question is likely to recover his sense of self.<br>

Abstract: En janvier 2003, le Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie ferme ses portes. Ses collections sont transférées au quai Branly, en vue de l'ouverture d'un musée des arts et civilisations d'Afrique, d'Asie, d'Océanie et des Amériques. Différentes campagnes d'enquêtes, réalisées depuis 2000, rendent intelligible ce nouvel épisode de l'histoire mouvementée du palais de la porte Dorée. A partir du triple point de vue de l'institution muséale, du personnel et du public, ces enquêtes éclairent le processus de la fermeture d'un musée « patrimoine national » et de son nouveau destin. La réflexion porte plus précisément sur les liens apparemment contradictoires entre rupture et continuité, clôture et pérennité, pesanteurs du passé et évolution du regard. La création prochaine d'une Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration peut illustrer ces paradoxes. The National Museum of African and Oceanian Arts closed in January 2003. Its collections were transferred to the future Quai Branly Museum of Arts and civilizations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Various survey campaigns carried out since the year 2000 explain this new episode of the eventful history of the Palais at the Porte Dorée. From the threefold point of view of the museum institution, the personnel and the visitors these surveys throw some light on the closure process of a museum belonging to the national patrimony and on its new destiny. The study is focussed on the seemingly contradictory relations between rupture and continuity, closure and durability, heaviness of the past and new look at museums. The future creation of a national city of the history of immigration illustrates these paradoxes. Das nationale Museum der Afrikanischen und Ozeanischen Künste wurde im Januar 2003 geschlossen. Seine Sammlungen wurden in dem zukünftigen Museum der Künste und Zivilizationen aus Afrika, Asia, Okeania und die Amerikas am Quai Branly gebracht.Verschiedene Erhebungen, die seit 2000 durchgeführt wurden, ~<br>

Author(s): Schnell Izhak<br>
Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: The proposition is that arts marketing should be conceived of as a dedicated field of endeavour so that consumers' immersion in the artistic experience occurs even in the case of a "difficult" art work. The focus is artistic experience-related phenomena. The authors introduce the concept of appropriation and then develop an appropriation cycle construct. Empirical research comprises introspective reports on consumer attendance at classical music concerts. The results show that the artistic experience is predicated on multiple rather than one-time immersion, and that full immersion may never occur. The authors conclude that those service elements that affect the way in which consumers experience an arts event should be managed throughout the appropriation process. Les auteurs proposent de concevoir le marketing des arts comme un domaine d'activité spécifique, afin que l'immersion des consommateurs dans l'expérience artistique soit possible même dans le cas d'une œuvre « difficile » . L'accent est mis sur les phénomènes liés à l'expérience artistique. Ils présentent le concept d'appropriation, puis développent un construit du cycle d'appropriation. Ils ont recours à la recherche empirique, soit les rapports d'analyse introspective des consommateurs ayant assisté à des concerts de musique classique. Les résultats indiquent que l'expérience artistique suppose de multiples immersions, non pas une seule, et que l'immersion totale risque de ne jamais se produire. Les auteurs concluent que les éléments du service qui influent sur l'expérience individuelle d'un événement artistique devraient être gérés tout au long du processus d'appropriation. Los autores proponen la idea de que el márketing de las artes debe concebirse como un emprendimiento en sí mismo, a fin de lograr la inmersión del consumidor en experiencia artística incluso en el caso de obras de arte "difíciles". El acento, entonces, está puesto en los fenómenos que se vinculan con la experiencia artística. Los auto~<br>

Abstract: Penser la nature du procédé de genèse du sens au moyen de l'analogie devient possible lorsque cette notion est envisagée dans la perspective critique modelée par la philosophie kantienne. Saisir comment s'effectue le passage de l'aspect formel à celui, événementiel, du sens, sur le mode du comme si, permet plus précisément d'envisager les enjeux du problème posé par les conditions d'élaboration, mais aussi de mise en œuvre d'un sens commun qui renvoie jusqu'aux perspectives propres au domaine de l'esthétique et du politique. Thinking the nature of the process of genesis of meaning through analogy becomes liable when the latter notion is understood within the critical perspective shapened through Kantian philosophy. Grasping how the passage from the formal to the eventful aspect of meaning on the as if mode enables one to understand more precisely the stakes of the problem set by the conditions of elaboration but also the erection of a common sense referring all the way to the specific perspectives of the aesthetic and political field.<br>

Abstract: La première partie de cet article (Revue philosophique, 2001-4, p. 435-480) envisageait, pour le siècle nouveau, un judéo-christianisme compatible avec l'athéisme contemporain, car il consisterait en une sorte de pratique « théâtrale » qui, de la tradition, ne retiendrait pas la foi métaphysique et historique mais le couple péché/Rédemption vécu comme une sorte d'illusion positive. On essaie maintenant de déterminer le rôle qu'ont pu jouer, dans ce devenir : Kant, Bergson, Freud, le pape Jean-Paul II et certains philosophes français d'aujourd'hui (Michel Henry, Alain Juranville, Jean-Luc Marion). The first part of this paper (Revue philosophique, 2001-4, p. 435-480) was studying, for this coming century, a new judeo-christianism compatible with contemporary atheism since it would consist in some kind of a theatrical practice. This new form of judeo-christianism would keep from tradition no longer the metaphysical and historical faith but the couple sin/redemption, lived as some kind of a positive illusion. One now attempts at determining what may be the part played in such a process by Kant, Bergson, Freud, Pope John Paul II and a few French philosophers of today (namely : Michel Henry, Alain Juranville, Jean-Luc Marion).<br>

Abstract: Audit schemes dictating the parameters of environmentally and socially acceptable management practice have emerged as a pervasive feature of global agri-food production. While the impacts of such schemes on the global movement of food and fibre and the evolving terrains of power in agri-food relations are well documented, the associated reconstruction of farming identities in the localities where audits are implemented has received less attention. The emerging responses to audit schemes in the New Zealand kiwifruit and dairy sectors are key examples of the contentious nature through which auditing is incorporated within farming practice. Analysis of these responses reveals the potential for audits to alter the spirit of farming in New Zealand, initiating new conventions of interaction between producers and industries. Within a convention theory framework, the incorporation of auditing within standard management practice involves a negotiated process in which the farmers employ strategic justifications of their capability (and value) relative to the quality designations established by the audit. Rather than evaluate the relative merits of a farm, its product and its owner through the craft and skill of the independent land manager, successful farming is increasingly associated with the individual's ability to conform to an audit's structures. The global trend toward audit schemes suggests that similar challenges to the spirit of farming may be replicated in other contexts.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's liberta~<br>

Abstract: Robert Morrison Maclver — Franklin Giddings' successor at the Columbia University was a leading opponent of positivism (George Lundberg), empricism (William Ogburn) and antitheoretical praxism (Robert Lynd). Maclver developed sociological theorizing along the Weberian tradition. The paper focuses on the temporality concerns of Maclver: 1) the question of distinct qualitative times, 2) the question of various temporal modes of being in the sociocultural realm, 3) temporality in social action. Maclver, unrecognized by today's symbolic interactionists, sought the implications of George H. Mead's work on time for analysis of activity as dynamic remaking of the present. The unity of the meaningful or symbolic and the temporal aspects of social pheomena was evident in the Maclver's theorizing. In consonance with the Bergsonian criticism of scientific mechanism Maclver was critical of variable-centered methodology. He analyzed the temporal modes of being of events, processes and cultural objects and focused on different ways society, history and culture enter the time process. Maclver made the temporality of actions the key issue. He should be classified as symbolic interactionist along with Florian Znaniecki and Pitirim Sorokin.<br>

Abstract: As the twentieth century comes to an end, and with it a millennium, there has been much heated reflection on the passing age and the period of transition. Among the many characteristic phenomena of modern times, globalization has attracted particularly much attention. The process of European integration may be traced back to ancient times (vide Roman imperialism or Carolingian universalism). Recently, however, globalization has expanded and it has accelerated considerably. The author of this paper focuses on the current, paradoxical coexistence of global tendencies toward integration on the one hand and very clearly manifested, diversifying (or even separatists) national and nationalist tendencies on the other hand. The author analyzes these homogenizing tendencies at the level of media pop culture on the one hand and the increasing, even acute, awareness of diversity, including the diversity of national cultures, on the other hand. She does so within the framework of the symbolic culture concept. Contemporarily, tendencies toward globalization are suspended between the Scylla of uniformizatdon and the Charybdis of diversity. Sociology is particularly qualified to study these phenomena, at both local and universal levels.<br>

Abstract: Les vichysto-résistants peuvent être définis comme des hommes dont l'expérience vichyste marque, d'un point de vue idéologique, organisationnel, stratégique et/ou relationnel, les formes de leur résistance. Nous étudions ici la spécificité de la résistance issue de Vichy, les voies de leur « métamorphose », les modalités de l'inscription des vichysto-résistants dans la Résistance en voie d'unification et la manière dont ils influencèrent les processus de construction identitaire de la Résistance dans son ensemble. Whether from an ideological, an organisational, a strategic or a relational point of view, the resistance experience of the men who can be defined as « Vichyst-Resistants » was shaped by their Vichy experience. This article aims at establishing the distinctive political and organisational features of the « Vichyst-Resistants », their paths of metamorphosis and the ways they moved into the Resistance during its process of unification. We will see how this incorporation affected the identity-building processes of the Resistance as a whole.<br>

Issue: i40058970<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that Meiji Shrine Memorial Art Gallery (Meiji Jingū Seitoku Kinen Kaigakan) was constructed as a mnemonic space, and that its construction concerned the making of history. The purpose of the gallery was to provide a historical narration of the Meiji period through 80 paintings depicting Emperor Meiji's life. It took over 20 years from the initial planning of the gallery to its completion in 1936 and, throughout the course of its creation, different acts of remembering took place both inside and outside the space of the gallery. It was the lengthy process of gallery construction, rather than the place itself that shaped what was to be remembered. Historiographers and painters strove to portray "real" history in the gallery's paintings. Historiographers investigated historical facts and determined the gallery's picture topics. Importantly, most of them were responsible for compiling two national historiographies, Dai Nihon ishin shiryō in the Ministry of Education and Meiji tennōki in the Imperial Household Agency. For the painters, the challenge lay in determining "realistic" styles of painting adequate to the representation of "real" history. Furthermore, physical constructors of the gallery played a part in perfecting its narrative structure, such as spatial arrangement of the pictures. The contrast between the expectations of the gallery's creators and the experience of the visitors, in terms of how the gallery was viewed as well as how it was to be viewed, is also the subject of this paper.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>

Author(s): Baumgartner Frédérique<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on Gina Pane's performance Escalade non anesthésiée (1971), which consisted of the artist mounting a ladder studded with sharp metallic shards, causing injury to herself in the process. Previous art historians have read Pane's performances through a psychoanalytic lens, emphasizing the place of Lacanian thought in the nascent French feminist movement of the 1970s. This article posits that psychoanalytic accounts of Pane's work have neglected the political context of the work's execution and reception. Pane specifically referenced the Vietnam War when she described her intention with Escalade non anesthésiée. Accordingly, this article links her performance to art sociologique - a term applied to a range of politicized works produced in Paris in the wake of the May 68 events - and thereby to the politics of the Internationale Situationniste. Stressing the importance of the concept of alienation in the discourse of the 1970s and in Pane's writings, this article argues that the masochistic elements of her performance were an attempt to end collective passivity. This collective de-anesthetization was carried out by Pane through the photo-documentation of her performance, in which she staged the image of a non-specific rather than individual body.<br>

Author(s): Zembrzycki Stacey<br>
Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Author(s): Waistell Jeff<br>
Abstract: This study investigates how business leaders dynamically narrate their aspirational ethical leadership identities. In doing so, it furthers understanding of ethical leadership as a process situated in time and place. The analysis focuses on the discursive strategies used to narrate identity and ethics by ethnic Chinese business leaders in Indonesia after their conversion to Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. By exploring the use of metaphor, our study shows how these business leaders discursively deconstruct their 'old' identities and construct their 'new' aspirational identities as ethical leaders. This leads to the following contributions. First, we show that ethical leadership is constructed in identity talk as the business leaders actively narrate aspirational identities. Second, the identity narratives of the business leaders suggest that ethical leadership is a context-bound and situated claim vis-à-vis unethical practice. Third, we propose a conceptual template, identifying processes of realisation and inspiration followed by significant shifts in understanding, for the study of aspirational ethical leadership.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40072033<br>
Date: 4 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The article presents the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse (SKAD). SKAD, which has been in the process of development since the middle of the 1990s, is now a widely used framework among social scientists in discourse research in the German-speaking area. It links arguments from the social constructionist tradition, following Berger and Luckmann, with assumptions based in symbolic interactionism, hermeneutic sociology of knowledge, and the concepts of Michel Foucault. It argues thereby for a consistent theoretical and methodological grounding of a genuine social sciences perspective on discourse interested in the social production, circulation and transformation of knowledge, that is in social relations and politics of knowledge in the so-called 'knowledge societies'. Distancing itself from Critical Discourse Analysis, Linguistics, Ethnomethodology inspired discourse analysis and the Analysis of Hegemonies, following Laclau and Mouffe, SKAD's framework has been built up around research questions and concerns located in the social sciences, referring to public discourse and arenas as well as to more specific fields of (scientific, religious, etc.) discursive struggles and controversies around "problematizations" (Foucault).<br>

Author(s): Torres Carlos Alberto<br>
Abstract: This article begins with a discussion of the implications of CONFINTEA VI having been organised in Brazil - the author uses the term "Brazilian effect" - and the role of social movements challenging neoliberalism. Next, drawing from the experience of Latin America, this paper analyses the counterhegemonic practice of the new social movements. The concluding section highlights the dilemmas faced by UNESCO in trying to create a democratic and efficient process of policy-making and institutional service in adult education in the nationstates. Furthermore, the proposal of popular education portrayed by the new social movements is described as a tool for empowerment. CONFINTEA VI's recommendation of moving from rhetoric to action in adult education programmes, practices and policies demands that we take the agendas of the new social movements in the post-neoliberalism era seriously. Cet article commence par une discussion sur les implications de CONFINTEA VI organisée au Brésil - l'auteur utilise le terme « effet Brésil » - ainsi que sur le rôle des mouvements sociaux qui contestent le néolibéralisme. À partir de l'expérience de l'Amérique latine, l'auteur analyse ensuite la pratique des nouveaux mouvements sociaux qui s'oppose à toutes les formes d'hégémonie. Dans la dernière partie sont abordés les dilemmes auxquels est confrontée l'UNESCO dans ses efforts de créer au coeur des Étatsnations un mécanisme démocratique et efficace d'élaboration de politiques et de prestations institutionnelles en matière d'éducation des adultes. En outre, l'éducation populaire telle qu'elle est proposée par les nouveaux mouvements sociaux y est décrite comme un instrument d'autonomisation. La recommandation de CONFINTEA VI de passer de la parole aux actes dans les programmes, les pratiques et les politiques d'éducation des adultes exige que nous prenions au sérieux les concepts des nouveaux mouvements sociaux en cette ère postnéolibérale. Dieser Artikel beginnt mit einer Diskussion darübe~<br>

Abstract: This paper is about the analysis of the written production of argumentative discourse. Thanks to the technique of collective writing it is possible to observe the process of discourse production. Declarative, strategic and procedural abilities of two non native adults are successively analyzed and compared periodically to those of two young native speakers. This study focuses on only two levels : global and interphrasal organisation of discourse. The organisation of debates in class so as to bring students to build argumentative concepts and help them in their approach of texts (reading and writing) shows the limits of a didactic scheme which relies on oral language practice for the elaboration of written texts.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo traz uma reflexão sobre o método etnográfico enquanto encapsulando o tema da identidade narrativa do antropólogo, em especial, enfocando o problema ético-moral da busca da coerência interna de sua produção etnográfica através da análise do processo de construção do conhecimento antropológico. Trata-se de pontuar, neste processo, o que está verdadeiramente em jogo, ou seja, o ato de configuração e reconfiguração do tempo que encerra a ação interpretativa em Antropologia. This article brings a reflections about the ethnographic method while encapsulating the identity theme describes by the anthropologist, in special, focusing the moral-ethic problem of the searching of the internal coherence of its ethnographic production through the study of the process of the anthropologic knowledge construction. It is to point, in this process, that is really in the play, or, the act of configuration and reconfiguration of time that stops the interpretative action in anthropology.<br>

Abstract: La science ('ilm) et la connaissance (ma'rifa) ont été peu étudiées chez Ibn 'Arabī. L'objectif de cet article est de signaler l'importance doctrinale et épistémologique de ces deux notions fondamentales ainsi que leurs implications herméneutiques et symboliques, le tout dans une interrogation qui porte sur la question du ta'wil. Le processus de l'étude va de la définition lexicographique de l'herméneutique et du symbolisme jusqu'à l'articulation doctrinale entre la science et la connaissance chez notre auteur en passant par la réception contemporaine de l'oeuvre d'Ibn Arabïet les premières ébauches concernant le ta'wü dans la tradition musulmane. Cette étude déterminera les configurations doctrinales de cette question autour de la dualité « apparent » (ẓāhir) et «caché» (bātin). La réception qu'a faite Ibn 'Arabī des idées de ses prédécesseurs est marquée à la fois par la dette et la critique, et une élaboration profonde et riche en enseignement de la question du ta'wil. العلم والمعرفة لم يحظيا بدراسة كافية عند ابن عربي.غرضر هذا المقال الإشارة إلى أهمية هذين امهومين امحت ا/مامسين من الناحية العقائدية والمعرفية، وما ينعلويان عليه من الماحية التفسيرية والرمزية، الكل في تساؤل حول موضوعة التأويل. تحلك الدراسة بدءأ من تحديد معجمز للتفسير والرمز إلى المفصل العقائدي بين العلم والمعرفة عند ابن مربي، مرورأ بتعامل المعاصرين صع أعمال ابن عربي والمقاربات الاولى للتأويل في التراث الإسلامي. من شان هذه الدراسة تحديد التشكل العقائدي للموضوع حول ثنائية «الظاهر» ي و«الباطن» . في تلقي ابن عربي لمن سبقوه نين ونقد، بإعداد عميق وثري كمثال يحتذى لموضوع التأويل.

Abstract: Any praxis is inscribed in time. To what extent does man's perception of time leave an inprint on Saussurian 'langue' ? Revisiting a well-beaten track in linguistic studies, we propose to give this farreaching question a partial answer concerning the opposition between French imparfait and passé simple. We first capture the opposition between those two tenses in a passive way, in which man as a subject (subjected to...) bears witness to the flow of time from future to past; we then capture the opposition in an active way, in which man as a project bears witness to the flow of time from past to future. This two-fold representation bears on the opposition between imperfect and simple past. It is shown next that linguistic theories view tenses as markers of localisation in time whereas verb forms also help mark how the time implied by the process is viewed, what orientation is given to it. Our contention is that implied time is represented in a downward fashion (particularisation) with imperfect and in an upward fashion (generalisation) with simple past.<br>

Abstract: This study examines the functions of the bilingual discourse strategy of language alternation in the process of marking boundaries of continuous discourse. The focus is on switched discourse markers -- employed, it is argued, to metalanguage the frame of the discourse. The corpus is comprised of audio recordings of over 20 hours of Hebrew-English bilingual conversation. The strategy of language alternation at discourse markers is illustrated, and the switched discourse markers are classified according to Becker's approach to context (1988b) as a source of constraints on text. This classification is then related to the phenomenon of clustering of discourse markers at discourse unit boundaries in both bilingual and monolingual discourse. Finally, cross-linguistic differences in discourse markers are related to a theory of metalanguage.<br>

Abstract: This study examines how deadlines and time limits for conference talks organize the discourse of consensus among collaborating experimental and theoretical physicists in a university laboratory. Six months of videotaped observations, including two cycles of conference talk preparation, indicate that, as the date of an upcoming conference nears, several things happen. (a) Co-authoring physicists usually have not achieved agreement on all aspects of the findings. (b) They nevertheless direct their energies to constructing a hybrid presentation rhetoric that satisfies the co-authors and fits the talk to the official conference talk time limit. (c) In the process of working through matters of rhetoric -- what to say, what to display visually, what to leave out, and in what order the information should be presented -- the physicists construct a working consensus on matters of physics: theory and experimental data explaining the properties and dynamics of the physical universe.<br>

Abstract: This study employs hermeneutics to illuminate a musical life history. I Made Lebah was a unique individual who lived during a violent and creative time of Bali's history. This paper explores his life through the lens of hermeneutics and identifies music stages through segmented, progressive hermeneutical arcs within his lifelong arc of experience. A consciousness of historical situatedness and an enabling appropriation allowed him to master a number of Balinese music styles and assume the title, "great teacher." The people he worked with, including composers Lotring and Colin McPhee and his lifelong friend, Agung Mandra, all affected him and helped him to acquire a self-awareness, a rapid learning and internalization process, and a sensitivity to reflective hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: C'est dans la Poétique d'Aristote que se trouve une méthode pour reconnaître le mal en politique. Ce que livre la « reconnaissance » issue de la réflexion poétique tient déjà à trois choses : le temps que prend le travail d'un aveu de soi à soi; la posture rhétorique double de délégation-consolation et de dévoilement plénier ; le joint du mal personnel et du mal public. Cette poétique est au cœur du phénomène de réconciliation en Afrique du Sud après la fin de l'apartheid, dans les travaux de la Commission Vérité et Réconciliation : une poétique de la réconciliation. It is in the Poetics of Aristotle that can be found a method for recognizing evil in politics. The "recognition" that is furnished by poetic reflection stems from three things: the time taken by the process of confession from self to self; the double rhetorical posture of delegation-consolation and complete exposure; the conjunction of personal evil and public evil. That poetic is at the heart of the phenomenon of reconciliation in South Africa after the end of apartheid, in the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: a poetic of reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: À La Réunion, l'école de la Troisième République s'est investie dans un processus d'acculturation nationale où les valeurs patriotiques et civiques ont été mises à l'honneur. L'affermissement du sentiment d'appartenance nationale s'est donc inscrit progressivement dans un patrio-bellicisme et dans une reconnaissance des bienfaits de la Nation pour les jeunes élèves de la colonie. Le lycée de Saint-Denis, établissement modèle accueillant les élites réunionnaises, a été l'objet à cet égard d'une attention particulière de la part des autorités coloniales. Durant la remise des prix effectuée chaque année avant les vacances scolaires, les élèves recevaient ainsi une dernière leçon édifiante d'instruction civique rappelant les fondements de la Nation et les devoirs inhérents au patriotisme. In Reunion Island, the School system of the Third Republic initiated a process of national cultural integration in which patriotic and civic values were promoted. As a result, the strengthened feeling of national belonging gradually developed into a patriotic/warmongering spirit and the recognition of the benefits brought by the nation in the minds of the young students of the colony. The Saint-Denis upper secondary school, a model school in which the colony elite studied, was therefore the object of particular attention from colonial authorities. Thus, during the prize ceremony held each year before the holiday break, pupils were taught a final lesson of civic responsibility with a reminder of the foundations of the nation and the duties inherent to patriotism. Auf der Insel Réunion, hat die Schule der Dritten Republik ein nationaler Akkulturationsprozess entwickelt, der die staatlich-patriotischen Werte in den Vordergrund brach. Die Befestigung des nationalen Zugehörigkeitsgefühls fällt dadurch schrittweise in einen kriegerischen Patriotismus und in die Erkennung der Wohltaten der Nation zugunsten der jungen Schüler der Kolonie.

Abstract: A broad conceptual framework is presented for utilizing spirituality in group psychotherapy. The author considers (a) selected concepts and theory relevant to the spiritual aspect of psychotherapy practice; (b) the change in assumptions about the person and the group they imply; (c) the mystical aspects of the listening/observing process; and (d) aspects of the new sciences compatible with spiritual principles. Using a psychospiritual paradigm, the author offers a view of group therapy that emphasizes the therapist as a contemporary mystic, the group as a sacred space, and a return to profound, timeless, nonrelativist spiritual values and goals, nonsensory infinite dimensional experience leading to deep transformation of the self, and the compatibility of contemporary scientific frameworks with spiritual principles that can form the basis of new theorizing and group interpretations.<br>

Abstract: No encontro intercultural e inter-religioso não se converte cada interlocutor à cultura e religiosidade alheia, mas abrem-se ambos à escuta (anamnesis originária) do Mistério que garante a autenticidade da própria vivência espiritual. O resultado deste processo é a transformação das duas religiosidades que se fecundam mutuamente, passando por um caminho de autocrítica, diálogo e práxis em comum. A teologia católica deveria estar preparada para aproveitar este desafio do pluralismo religioso interactivo e deixar-se transformar; mas, para isso, teria que avançar mais na linha de renovação e revisão hermenêutica levada a cabo na segunda metade do século passado. In the inter-cultural and inter-religious encounter, each partner does not make a conversion into the other culture and religiosity. What happens is an opening (original anamnesis) by both of them toward the Mystery that guarantees the authenticity of their own spiritual experience. The result of this process is the transformation of both styles of religiosity that fertilize each other through an interchange of dialogue, self-criticism and common praxis. Catholic theology should be ready to make the most out of this challenge from the interactive religious pluralism and let oneself be transformed. In order to be able to achieve such transformation, Catholic theology should keep improving the hermeneutical turn achieved during the second half of the last century.<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion s'inscrit dans l'héritage de Paul Ricœur, à la recherche d'une philosophie de la traduction. Langage, langues, traduction entrant dans le jeu du processus de la constitution du sens, la traduction devient le moment privilégié d'une reconstruction de l'unité plurielle du discours humain et ouvre la voie à une éthique de l'hospitalité langagière et de la convivialité. Le don de la langue et des langues introduit un élément de gratuité qui corrige l'obsession contemporaine pour la marchandisation généralisée des mondes vitaux et laisse entrevoir un possible fondement non violent du lien social dans une perspective de solidarité et de sollicitude pour les personnes concrètes. Je propose d'établir une relation entre le don des langues en tant qu'élément constitutif de la communauté des parlants et la dette de l'hospitalité langagière impliquant une forme de responsabilité envers les autres à la fois spécifique et exemplaire. Au don gratuit de la langue et des langues qui nous permet d'accéder au monde et de nous rencontrer avec autrui, en réalisant entièrement nous-mêmes, correspond la dette d'exercer et de développer notre humanité dans le langage et à travers le langage. This study reflects on the philosophy of translation in light of the heritage of Paul Ricœur. Language, languages and translation all belong to the process of constitution of sense and here translation is of particular importance for the reconstitution of the plurality of human discourse in its unity and opens the way to an ethics of linguistic hospitality and sociability. The gift of language and of languages introduces an element of gratuity to correct the contemporary obsession with the general commercialization of the life world and suggests a possible non-violent foundation for the social bond in the perspective of solidarity and sollicitude for concrete persons. I propose to establish a relation between the gift of languages as a constitutive element of the community of speakers a~<br>

Abstract: The article develops an understanding of public deliberations during a peace process, focusing on the interaction between the elite level negotiations and the "public peace process." It does so by examining the dialogical mechanisms that are set to work in the public sphere once the elite consider the possibility of identifying the former enemies as allies or friends. These dialogical mechanisms, the author argues, add up to a shift in the manner the public interprets the discourse that regulates its relationship with the elite toward what the author calls, following Paul Ricoeur, 'hermeneutics of suspicion.' Thus, the peace process generates a need for the public to re-examine the terms of understanding that defined its relationship with the former enemy. However this same process might also lead the public to re-examine the terms by which it understands its relationship with the elite.<br>

Abstract: En croisant les approches contemporaines sur la traduction, l'histoire culturelle et l'histoire des idées, l'article cherche à comprendre la signification politique et les enjeux rhétoriques de la traduction des textes républicains de la première Révolution anglaise autour de 1789. Le but est de dépasser l'analyse en termes d'influence d'une tradition, pour s'intéresser à la transmission et au contexte de réception des textes, c'est-à-dire à l'agenda politique et au projet traductif des auteurs dans un état donné de la langue. Comment ces textes s'insèrent-ils dans le contexte intellectuel et les conventions argumentatives du moment révolutionnaire? Dans quelle mesure ces traductions ont-elles été des outils de l'innovation politique? L'interprétation du traducteur éclaire le contexte qui les a inspirées et le processus de transfert et de réception des idées et du vocabulaire. Sur l'horizon d'attente de 1789, le bonheur de la traduction dépend moins de la fidélité à l'original que de la manière de rendre l'esprit du texte et sa force illocutoire pour traduire les idées en actes. By combining contemporary approaches to translation, cultural history and the history of ideas, this article seeks to understand the political meanings and the rhetorical issues involved in the translation of republican texts of the first English Revolution in the French Revolution of 1789. The aim is to go beyond an analysis of the influence of a tradition to concentrate on the transmission and reception of the texts - that is, on the political agenda and their translation. How were these texts incorporated in the intellectual context and in the argumentative conventions of the revolutionary moment? To what degree were these translations the tools of political innovation? The particular interpretation of a translator does much to clarify the context that inspired his translations and illuminates the process of the transfer and reception of ideas and vocabulary.

Abstract: In an empirical study using five real-world creative teams from an advertising agency, participants were given a strategic brief for a new beverage product and asked to design the layout for a print ad. Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apoarent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios. Not coincidentally, as a tentative conclusion, this more flexible team produced the ad judged most successful by advertising professionals. This still-to-be-tested exploratory finding deserves further investigation in future research that embodies various methodological refinements.<br>

Abstract: Cet article interroge la validation des acquis de l'expérience, droit instauré en 2002 dans le Code du travail, sur sa capacité à favoriser une meilleure reconnaissance du travail des salariés. Il s'appuie sur une enquête réalisée auprès de 15 entreprises, associations ou branches professionnelles engagées dans des opérations collectives de validation des acquis de l'expérience (VAE). Après avoir identifié quatre logiques distinctes de mise en œuvre du dispositif par les employeurs, les auteurs examinent les canaux par lesquels la VAE, telle qu'elle se pratique dans l'entreprise, pourrait favoriser la reconnaissance du travail. D'un côté, la mise en mots du travail est un puissant moyen de le rendre visible et l'opportunité de confrontation avec les pairs permet de renforcer l'identité professionnelle, mais de l'autre, la VAE influe peu sur la rémunération et l'ambiguïté demeure fréquente sur l'objet même de la validation. Le regard croisé des employeurs et des salariés montre donc à quel point la reconnaissance du travail ne va pas de soi. Mais la voie est tracée pour qu'il puisse en être autrement dans le cadre de procédures plus négociées, notamment avec l'acteur syndical. Based on a survey conducted in 15 firms, associations or occupations where work-based experiences were being validated under the terms of a law that entered the French Labor Code in 2002, questions are raised about this process and its capacity for obtaining more recognition for the work done by wage-earners. After identifying four distinct employer rationales for implementing validation, the channels favoring the obtainment of such recognition are examined when this procedure is actually applied inside firms.

Abstract: In the context of globalization, cultural anthropology gained a new momentum by highlighting the self-conscious persistence of cultural differences. Against the background of an ever increasing intensity of societal and economic entanglements, the vital claim of cultural differences must be a reflexive process associated with the idea that one's own culture is creative and adaptive to innovations. Anthropologists have defined a set of tools in order to describe these processes of cultural changes. These tools have the names of hybridization, creolization and domestication, but, in particular also of cultural appropriation. Historically cultural appropriation was mainly relevant in contexts of unequal power relations. Appropriation thereby became a strategy of the powerless, who used appropriation in order to undermine the structures defined by the powerful. Cultural appropriation can also be practised through mimesis, and thereby negates the authority of powerful actors. Cultural appropriation requires moments of negotiations and does not aim at definitive results, but merely at the transgression of boundaries. Well defined fields of cultural appropriation within anthropology are media studies and consumption. Empirical approaches to a more detailed documentation of appropriation can be the following: (1) Naming, (2) Contextualization, (3) Incorporation and (4) material transformation.<br>

Abstract: An increasing number of individuals worldwide are receiving home nursing care from loved ones. Many healthcare professionals are exploring the use of narrative to help family caregivers meet the personal demands of this work. Citing Ricoeur's notion of narrative identity as a social process in which cultural norms and values are negotiated between speaker and audience, this paper argues that health care professionals can assist their clients by viewing narrative as collaboration, not autonomous construction. Collaboration in construction of narrative identity was observed in interactions between family caregivers and public health workers on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. There, caregivers were supported by a dialogic process in which interlocutors explored the cultural values that define and delimit the possibilities for living as caregivers.<br>

Abstract: Norbert Elias never presented his views regarding collective memory in a systematic manner. However, his approach may be reconstructed on the basis of such works as The Civilizing Process, Time: An Essay and The Symbol Theory. The most important tenet of Elias is that human memory can only be explained by the symbol theory. Human ability to use socially created symbols in communication is applied in activities in which symbols are used (speaking, thinking, knowing and remembering), which makes memory a part of general process of symbolic communication. Memory research needs to account for the interactive and communicational origins of both individual and collective remembering. One of the crucial issues related to remembering is collective forgetting. According to Elias it operates by three main mechanisms: (1) elimination and creation of fantastic notions (fantasy being a substitute and subsidiary for experience), (2) modification of social canons of reference as a result of power struggle in social figurations, and (3) delegitimization of alternative imageries by means of marginalization or elimination of groups acting as their social vehicles. I discuss these mechanisms and the dynamics of memory they entail in the broader conceptual framework of the theory of civilizing processes referring to Central and Eastern European examples in order to demonstrate the productivity of Elias's interdisciplinary and multidimensional analysis in social memory studies focusing this region.<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: The article presents an analysis of the concept of „subject“ in ethnography from its historical origins through its development over the span of the 20th century. Furthermore, based on her own experience of different cultures, the author conføonts the implicit Western philosophical background in anthropological conceptualisations of the subject and the ethnographic research with alternative philosophical frameworks, specifically the reflexive approach developed by female anthropologists. The main focus of the text lies on a re-conceptualisation of the ethnographic research as an inter-subjective process, and on a new emphasis on the role of the subject in the culture-productive processes of symbolic negotiation.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Abstract: The Republic of Korea and Japan share a tumultuous history, but arguably no period has caused greater trauma in bilateral relations than the twentieth century. After Japan's four-decade long colonial occupation of Korea, the two countries took two decades just to establish diplomatic relations. Subsequent interactions have remained seriously compromised by the memory of colonialism. This article reviews the tensions behind the tempestuous bilateral relationship, focusing on the depiction of Japan's wartime past in school textbooks. We advance three suggestions for reconciliation: viewing reconciliation not as the restoration of a harmonious pre-conflict order, but as an ongoing, incomplete process; expanding promising bilateral dialogues; and accepting that there will always be differences between Korea and Japan, most notably with regard to representations of the past. Rather than being an inevitable source of conflict, these differences should contribute to an ongoing process of negotiation between the two neighbors.<br>

Abstract: This article looks at the characteristics of "frictions over history" in ROK-Japan relations since the 1990s, with a focus on Korea's responses. It addresses some hypotheses on the characteristics and trends shown in the political process of "blundering" through comparative analysis of sixty-one cases, and additionally presents an in-depth case study on Prime Minister Abe Shinzo's remarks of 2007 concerning the comfort women issue. This research shows that the responses to blunders and the political process were the products of interactions between the agent's speech acts and are a type of language game that is linguistically inter-constituted. Moreover, the 2007 comfort women case study shows that conflicts and the process of negotiations regarding blunders are a type of constructive language game in which the agents construct rules of engagement, modify mutual perceptions, and transform actors themselves through a series of speech acts.<br>

Abstract: The central point is that Schutz's idealization of reciprocity, the matching of subjective intentions in the public world of interactive behaviour, necessarily involves agents in an ironic process. This is largely because, since they are taking so much for granted, they cannot be aware of what is latent in the intentional perspectives of their social partners. In bringing out the pattern of the irony of inter subjective dialectic, the argument makes plain the importance of pretence as a vital concept in philosophy, sociology and hermeneutics. The article closes with a criticism of naive optimism among purveyors of dialectic, recommending a proper concern with the irreconcilables of tragedy.<br>

Author(s): Ezzy Douglas<br>
Abstract: Two central unresolved problems in labour process theory are the disjuncture between structure and agency and the problem of what constitutes 'good' work. This paper argues that a hermeneutic conception of the self as constructed through narrative provides a resolution to these two issues. Hermeneutics conceptualises the self as neither a solitary entity impervious to the influence of others, nor as a mere reflection of objective structures or 'discourses of power'. Rather, in the process of self-interpretation a person uses socially learnt cultural discourses to construct and reconstruct a coherent sense of narrative-identity. Substantive illustrations are drawn from labour process theory, recent developments in management theory, and some more general studies of the meaning of working.<br>

Author(s): Adamson Kay<br>
Abstract: In July 2004, a young woman claimed that she had been attacked on the Paris urban railway system by four Maghrebins and two Africans and that the discovery that she might be Jewish had intensified the character of the attack. For a number of days, the French media were dominated by the case and leading politicians condemned it. The events drew attention to a number of issues concerning culture and identity in contemporary France and the role played in constituting this identity of history and memory. However, it also displayed how the constitution of identity is a selective process in which different elements may be dealt with, either in different ways or omitted altogether. This article explores how in attempting to come to terms with the legacies of anti-Semitism, other areas of history and memory have been neglected, including the legacy of France's colonial empire, and, in particular, her relationship with Algeria.<br>

Issue: i40108742<br>
Date: 5 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Newton Tim<br>
Abstract: This paper links the ideas of Norbert Elias to the conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that has developed in British industrial and organisational (I/O) sociology. It examines the relevance of power and subjectivity to British I/O sociology and reviews theoretical positions that have influenced this field. Elias's work is examined in some detail, exploring his approach to power, agency, the self, individualisation and discourse. His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the 'networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory. Elias's work also illustrates the need for a lengthier historical perspective than is typically observed in industrial and organisational sociology, and points to the value of studies which look beyond the context of the workplace. Finally, attention is paid to some of the limitations of Elias's work.<br>

Abstract: Primo Levi's If This Is a Man is a central work in understanding the way in which the subjective memory of a Holocaust survival receives a general meaning. This requires a context in which the duty to prevent the repetition of the tragic events endured by European Jews becomes a universal responsibility we must assume. This text examines the process of dehumanization and total degradation of a human being in the conditions of the death camp, and examines the antidote that Levi proposes for escaping the state of existential pathology. Particular emphasis is placed on the way in which Levi, who embraces secular humanist values, uses religious background and religious symbolic structures in order to provide additional understanding of the fact that in the absence of God, the world itself becomes void of humanity.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113394<br>
Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Bishop Edward L.<br>
Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Issue: i40113412<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Stampfl Barry<br>
Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

A widespread reaction is observed against the impersonality of much literary theory and the dangers of reducing reading to a science, but alternative models that stress the therapeutic, self-enhancing, or playful elements in reading are also exposed to critical analysis.<br>

Abstract: On propose ici une analyse de la structure narrative du Saint Louis de Jacques Le Goff, de ses « trois drames » dont la succession (le troisième recomposant ce que le deuxième avait démonté du premier) crée l'effet de lecture. Celui-ci est, en particulier, animé par le retour des mêmes histoires, parfois des mêmes textes, sur lesquels l'historien exerce sa critique, patiemment et modestement, nous délivrant au passage une leçon de méthode. Peut-on lire un livre d'histoire comme un roman ? C'est la question que cet essai tente de poser, en même temps qu'il revient sur l'ambiguïté de son « personnage », Saint Louis qui fut peut-être, comme le Genet de Sartre, comédien et martyr. Proposed here is an analysis of the narrative structure of Jacques Le Goff's Saint Louis, of the « three dramas » which create, by their succession (the third drama recomposes what the second had deconstructed of the first), the effectiveness of its readability. This is particularly animated by the recurrence of the same stories, sometimes of the same texts, to which the author applies his criticism, with patience and humility, delivering to us in the process a lesson in methodology. Can a history book be read like a novel ? That is the question which this essay addresses, at the same time as it reverts to the ambiguity of its « personage » - Saint Louis -, who was perhaps, like Sartre's Genet, a comedian and a martyr.<br>

Abstract: The textual structure of the Titurel-fragments is a challenge to both narratology and the theory of lyric poetry. The article proposes a model of interpretation that implies a transgression of narratological approaches. It is based on the assumption that there is an essential relationship between narrative and lyrical concepts of time. The Titurel-fragments do not only show the transgression from lyrical narrative to narrative poetry but indicate the conditions of this process: lyrical presence can only emerge on the basis of a previous narrative interpretation of time. The fragments show on different textual levels how the poetic transgression of the narrative time concept can be achieved. The paradigmatic relationship of love and death in the first fragment reveals that the meaning of a story actually reaches beyond the oppositions that underlie the story-logic. The second fragment demonstrates the analogy between the use of metaphors in the story and the mediality of its narration: The notions of writing and semantic difference are sublated by a kind of sound logic that has to be recognized as a basic semantic nexus.<br>

Abstract: La recherche peut-elle être étudiée d'une manière qui n'est ni reconstruction logique, ni psychologie empirique, ni sociologie ? Pratiquement toutes les écoles importantes dans la philosophie contemporaine des sciences répondraient négativement. On esquisse ici une théorie de la recherche qu'on pourrait appeler ' théorie de systèmes ' ou ' praxiologie ' grâce à plusieurs modèles : modèles des facteurs qui gouvernent une entreprise de recherche, qui donnent à une tradition de recherche sa direction. (Ils peuvent être employés pour styliser la Science Normale et les Changements de Paradigme). Les modèles de la dynamique du processus de recherche vus comme une coagence de phases du travail « théoriques » et « empiriques ». (Cela nous aide à comprendre pourquoi des changements de paradigme arrivent normalement de temps en temps). Modèles de critères pour évaluer les résultats de la recherche. On soutient qu'il y a aussi des types de critères pour évaluer les changements de paradigme. (La thèse de l'incommensurabilité est considérée comme une renaissance de la problématique de l'historicisme — relativisme herméneutique). Ensuite les modèles sont employés dans la réflexion sur ellemême de la théorie de la recherche. On conclut avec des remarques sur les relations de la théorie de la recherche et de la philosophie. Can research be studied in a way that is neither logical reconstruction nor empirical psychology or sociology ? Pratically all the important schools in contemporary philosophy of science would answer negatively. In this paper an outline is given of a theory of research which could be called ' systems-theoretical ' or ' praxeological ' by means of several models : Models of the factors that steer a research enterprise, that give a research tradition its direction. (They may be used for stylizing Normal Science and Paradigm Shifts). Models of the dynamics of the research process seen as a coagency of « theoretical » and « empirical » phases of work.

Abstract: La critique phénoménologique de la métaphysique a opposé « l'intuition » à la « représentation », et le débat philosophique contemporain une phénoménologie « minimaliste » à une phénoménologie « maximaliste ». Face à ces alternatives, l'approfondissement weilien de l'expérience n'oppose ni la présence et l'absence, ni le fini et l'absolu, mais cherche à éprouver et penser le lien qui les unit, à partir de la structure trinitaire du don de l'être. À distance d'une médiation extériorisante comme d'une immanence pure, le processus de révélation n'est jamais négateur du mystère, mais en manifeste au contraire la profondeur. Ainsi, depuis la perception jusqu'à l'amour surnaturel, « évidence » et « mystère » vont toujours de pair, ce qui permet de ne rejeter aucun des niveaux de l'être et de l'expérience. The phenomenological critique of metaphysics opposed intuition and representation as contemporary debates in philosophy opposed minimalist and maximalist phenomenologies. Confronted with these alternatives the Weilean thought of experience neither opposes presence and absence, nor finite and absolute, but it tries to verify and think what unites them - based on the Trinitarian structure of the giving of being. Standing apart from exteriorizing mediation as from pure immanence, the revelation process never makes ineffective the mystery but expresses its depth. Thus, from perception to supernatural love, 'obviousness' and 'mystery' go together, which allows not to reject any levels of being and experience.<br>

Abstract: On associe généralement la figure de Satan à une signification indigente ou mesquine. Dans la Philosophie de la révélation, Schelling tente au contraire d'en donner une interprétation différente, selon laquelle la « mauvaiseté positive » de Satan n'est pas seulement assumée, mais également revalorisée. Cependant, le rôle de Satan demeure ambigu, incarnant à la fois le tentateur universel et le maillon nécessaire à la révélation de Dieu lui-même. Dans cette étude, il s'agit donc de montrer à la fois la nature amphibolique du Diable, et de rendre compte des multiples endossements qu'il recouvre. Une tâche qui implique précisément la mise en évidence du rôle incontournable de Satan dans la victoire finale du bien, et qui se manifeste, en termes schellingiens, par l'incompatibilité de l'homme avec le feu dévorant du principe de lumière, laquelle nécessite un principe obscur qui hâte la séparation, pressent le mal et le provoque. One usually associates the figure of Satan with an impoverished, insufficient signification. On the contrary, in the Philosophy of Revelation Schelling tries to give a different interpretation, according to which Satan's potential for evil is not only accepted but embraced and given a positive valence, postulating a sort of "positivity of evil". However, Satan's role remains ambiguous, since he represents both the universal tempter and a necessary link in the process that reveals God's presence in the world. In this paper, I want to emphasize the Devil's twofold nature and to explore his multiple forms. This highlights Satan's necessary role in the final triumph of good, and how this role appears, in Schellingian terms, through the human inability to sound the depths of the consuming fire of divine light, which necessitates the existence of a dark principle that entails a separation, foreknows evil and thereby creates it.<br>

Abstract: Metaphors cannot be studied in abstracto. The use of metaphors is part of the communication process of John's Gospel. Therefore this study starts with a consideration of the Gospel as a communicative act. This means that the author(s) employ(s) various means to alter the listeners'/readers' world view. Perhaps the most important way of achieving this is through the use of metaphors. Metaphors are created by way of unexpected predication through a deliberate category mistake. In this way the possibility is opened to innovative perception (seeing what was not there to see before) as well as to a redescription of reality. By relating the metaphors used in John's Gospel (e g true light, good shepherd, true vine, etc) to their possible communication situation, one can gain insight into the role metaphors play in identifying the Jesus of John.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this article is that the process of 'reading' (or constructing) a context is somehow analogous to the process of reading a text. The tools, concepts and categories developed in literary criticism to read texts may therefore be helpful for New Testament scholars' endevours to find ways and means to read context(s). Following a reflection on different possible conseptualisations of text and context, the notion of 'reading the context' is considered in the rest of the article on two levels: (i) the distinction between 'critic' and 'reader' in literary criticism is related to the distinction between 'emic' and 'etic' perspectives in cultural criticism, and (ii) the applicability of W Iser's phenomenological discription of the reading process for cultural criticism is considered and related to R Schreiter's methodological proposal for 'listening to cultures'.<br>

Abstract: An investigation into poets' creative use of the Christian Bible reveals that receptions of the Bible as an imaginative text play an important role in what is achieved in such poems. The article will deal with a coherent group of poems by Antjie Krog, Die Jerusalemgangers, in a volume titled Jerusalemgangers (1985). It consists of eight different poems grouped into three sections. Voices from many centuries echo in these poems. The central theme is developed through four main perspectives, namely a male leader, a 'black consciousness' voice, a woman visionary and the all-embracing and composing perspective of the poet as visionary which incorporates the perspectives of other South African literary voices. This central theme concerns the universal quest for a Utopia, in these poems with their religiously conscious speakers, Utopia is presented in the Biblical imagery of a new Jerusalem. The creative process is activated as each voice, in its pursuit of an imaginary ideal context, uses the same text as a guiding principle on its 'journey' towards 'liberation'. The poet juxtaposes ideological readings of the Christian Bible, directed by different experiences of the South African context. The poet's vision clearly becomes a voice among others and yet it functions as a composing factor. This leads to commenting secular texts entering into the discourse. In the poetic text structuring and linguistic principles can lead to aesthetic insights into ostensibly unreconciled elements. The reading of the poems presented in this article will be directed by such poetic conventions. An attempt will be made to identify the signifying role of the poet's response to the Biblical imagery. The reader's response to these poems is likewise influenced by an acquaintance with the Bible.<br>

Abstract: The present-day global culture challenges First-World theologians to coalesce with Third-World theologians. Such an enterprise is conditioned by the identification of commonalities in theological inquiry. Hermeneutics of the Bible, and especially of the New Testament, is an important common ground for 'traditional theology' and 'contextual theology' alike. This paper, however, argues that there is a foundational reason why the historical Jesus and not the canon should be seen as the common ground for the engagement by First-World as well as Third-World theologians. This argument relates to the epistemic status of the canon in liberation theology. The canon originated during the time when the horticultural society shifted to an agrarian one. This shift was accompanied by, among other things, the process of urbanisation and the increase of inequality and of the scarcity of resources. Our memory of the historical Jesus tradition keeps us in touch with Jesus' emancipatory living during these circumstances—an emancipatory living that unmasks the hegemony that could be embedded in the canon.<br>

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Abstract: After demonstrating that scripture's truth has always to be negotiated in terms of changing contexts, and after demonstrating that this is precisely what the church has already done with regard to remarriage, this essay argues that the church's teaching on marriage as an event is an increasingly irrelevant Victorian construct, not the originary will of God; and is maintained only by disregard – disregard of the hermeneutical nature of scripture's teachings on marriage, disregard of the process–understanding of marriage which has always dominated Africa and which is increasingly dominating global culture as a whole, and disregard of the church's teachings, even by active and committed members of the church. The essay argues that the hermeneutical nature of the Bible's teaching on this subject, as well as the church's own approach to remarriage, gives the church the responsibility to frame a Christian process-understanding of marriage which will better enable people to build stable, lifelong unions.<br>

Abstract: The author of the article in question reports on a study analysing how 15 year-old French lycée pupils interpret school texts about the representation of the Norman kings of Sicily in the 12th century, the latter of whom allowed themselves to be portrayed both as Byzantine emperors and as Muslim caliphs. Ever since Moscovic's theory of social representation, we know that people make sense of specialized knowledge (in this case, historical knowledge) by converting it into "naïve", everyday knowledge. As pupils generally cannot explain the political intentions of the kings of Sicily, the lycée pupils were asked – as part of the study – to deal with the assertions of a paper (written by another pupil) that compared the Norman kingdom of Sicily and the situation of Maghrebine immigrants in presentday France. The study takes a closer look at how the learners, in the course of the "spiral-shaped" learning process, first acquired a "naïve" picture of the kings of Sicily, only later to distance themselves from their original thoughts in order to be able to make sense of their school texts. Der Autor des vorliegenden Artikels berichtet über eine Untersuchung, die analysiert, wie 15-jährige französische Gymnasiasten Schulmaterialen über die Repräsentationen der normannischen Könige von Sizilien im 12. Jahrhundert interpretieren. Letztere ließen sich sowohl als byzantinische Kaiser wie auch als muslimische Kalifen darstellen. Seit Moscovicis Theorie der sozialen Repräsentationen wissen wir, dass Menschen Fachwissen (hier historischem Wissen) einen Sinn geben, indem sie es in ein „naives" Alltagswissen verwandeln. Da Schüler im Allgemeinen die politischen Intentionen der Könige von Sizilien nicht erklären können, wurden im Rahmen dieser Untersuchung Gymnasiasten aufgefordert, sich mit einer schriftlichen Schülerarbeit zu befassen, die das normannische Königreich von Sizilien und die Situation maghrebinischer Einwanderer im heutigen Frankreich vergleicht.

Abstract: In this paper some elements of the reading process of Luke 12:35-48 are analysed according to the theory of Wolfgang Iser. Two problems are stated in the introduction, namely the impossibility of accounting for the reading process exhaustively in one all-encompassing theory, and the difficulty of "applying" Iser's theory, which is proposed as a theory of the reading process and not a method for analysing the reading process of an actual text. After a short exposition of the philosophical background and the main elements of the theory, a description of some elements of the reading process of this particular text is given. The paper concludes with a short reflection on the viability of this theory for a practical reception analysis.<br>

Abstract: Communities, whether they are "real" or virtual, are mediated by interpretation. One's place within a community is also constituted by an ongoing metaphoric "reading" through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do. Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts. Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities, which makes them into forums that attempt to "connect the scattered members of an invisible republic" [1, p. 43] in an electronic world.<br>

Abstract: This study, based largely on unpublished material, is an attempt to describe and evaluate how French Protestantism dealt with the German question in the postwar period. A short description of the perception of Germany by French Protestants towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century underlines the new approach which characterized the relations between French and German Protestants after the Second World War. In spite of the shattering defeat of the Third Reich, Germany remained in the eyes of many French Protestants a dreadful danger. However, already shortly after the war, some clergymen and laymen, many of whom had been involved in the resistance against the nazi regime, believed that their mission was to act as mediators and peacemakers despite the official hard-line diplomacy of their country. This article provides a selection of quotations of French Protestants' intentions and conceptions regarding the German question, as well as examining the ways and means they thought best to prevent Germany from becoming a new danger to France and Europe. It shows how seriously they debated all aspects of a common future with yesterday's enemy in a Europe of tomorrow, and affords an insight into how some Protestant personalities on both sides of the Rhine played an important role in the process of Franco-German reconciliation during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: Le calcul économique, dans sa forme la plus connue, celle de l'analyse coûts/avantages, est depuis quelques années confronté à de multiples remises en cause. Considéré comme technocratique, partiel, voire partial, il est de plus en plus cantonné au rôle de composante parmi d'autres de l'aide à la décision publique. Le développement, dans le Royaume-Uni d'une nouvelle approche, multicritère, de l'évaluation des grands projets d'infrastructure de transport va-t-il sonner le glas du calcul économique ? Nous ne le pensons pas. Nous défendons au contraire la thèse selon laquelle il peut retrouver un rôle important. Mais, pour cela, il est nécessaire de reconsidérer le processus des choix collectifs. Dans cette nouvelle perspective, loin de constituer un processus purement technocratique, le calcul économique, à la lumière des travaux de Keynes et Schumpeter sur le rôle de la prévision et des prix, peut s'inscrire dans une forme renouvelée de maïeutique des choix collectifs, même dans le champ controversé des infrastructures de transport. Economic calculation, and especially cost benefit analysis (Coba), is more and more criticised and accused to be technocratic and partial, leading to a narrow view of projects. An example of this loss of credibility is the New Approach To Appraisal (NATA), implemented in Great Britain at the end of the 90': a multicriteria analysis where Coba gives only one information among many others, quantitative and qualitative. Nevertheless we don't think that we are facing an unavoidable decline of economic calculation. This paper emphasises the important role that Coba can keep within the public decision process. If we remember Keyne's and Schumpeter's points of view about the roles of forecasting and prices, economic calculation could be useful to help the emergence of collective choices, even in the controversial field of transport infrastructures.<br>

Abstract: Les jumelages constituent la première forme d'action internationale impliquant les institutions municipales en tant que telles. L'émergence de cette activité correspond à un processus d'invention de la tradition. Comprendre les tensions politiques occasionnées par ce processus donne accès à des mobilisations méconnues qui ont pourtant affecté les règles du jeu municipal. Retracer ces différents épisodes de l'histoire politique contribue autant à la compréhension de certaines entreprises politiques de la IVe République qu'à la découverte des conditions de possibilité d'évolutions ultérieures du jeu diplomatique, telle la coopération décentralisée. Town twinning can be seen as the first activity to involve municipal institutions as such in wideranging and long-term international action by councilors. Twinning fits Eric Hobsbawm's definition of an invented tradition. The invention of town twinning cannot be studied without a profound knowledge of the dynamic political tensions which emerged in the Cold War French political scene. Mobilizations led to a big turn in common interpretations of the municipal law. The study of this process helps understand the institutional change which made possible the rise of paradiplomacy in France.<br>

Abstract: The persecution, flight and murder of European Jews in the first half of the twentieth century and the profound social and political transformations that decisively affected European cities in the final decade of the 20th century have radically altered urban 'Jewish landscapes'. New stakeholders and institutions emerged with their own networks, goals and interests, and have constructed, staged and marketed 'Jewish culture' anew. The resultant Jewish spaces are being constituted in an urban space located at the intersection of ethnic representation, collective memory, and drawing on an imagined material culture, which includes architectural, physical and digital spaces (e.g. synagogues, Jewish quarters). This Europe-wide process is closely related to the delicate politics of memory and to discourses on the authenticity of cities. This article analyses how the image of 'Jewishness' plays an increasingly important role in the marketing of historical authenticity that cities and their tourism affiliates are undertaking.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the~<br>

Article Title: Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Dual Economy of Recognition<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Author(s): Schäfer Stefanie<br>
Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Article Title: War as a Form of "Apotheosis": The Militarization of the USA and Don DeLillo's "End Zone"<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138275<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Abstract: H. P. Lovecraft's texts deal with the cosmos providing words and mechanisms beyond words, such as analogy. Tracing the relationship between analogy and the poetic metaphor in the Lovecraftian text the paper turns to Paul Ricoeur's notion of the living metaphor as the embodiment of tension providing secondary referentiality. The essay argues that the ontological nature of analogy and metaphor supplies an indirect strategy to move towards the beyond, to transfer the unknown to the realm of the known. In this process, by referring to what is interstitial, void-like, and monstrous, this metaphorically active, poetic, and "ecstatic" Lovecraftian text becomes a "monster" in its own right: the indescribable and unnamable overflow into the world of representation, creating the monster-text.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores a phenomenon familiar to archivists: the seamless moment of time and space within the remembering process when communities become aware of and must confront the fragility of public memory and make decisions about the management and preservation of their information resources. This decision point has recently been called the documentary moment. The authors' exploration of this concept focuses on the theories, strategies, methodologies, and processes formerly employed and now emerging at Library and Archives Canada (LAC) to facilitate the disposition of government's information resources. They also examine the challenges presented by the digital age on the documentary moment and whether corresponding philosophical or methodological changes to current institutional strategies, including macro-appraisal, are required.<br>

Abstract: Depuis les années 1980, l'exhumation dmédico-légale des fosses communes est une pratique courante dans les contextes d'après-violence. Menées dans le but de soulager le « traumatisme » des familles de victimes, adossées à une exigence de « vérité » sur les crimes perpétrés, les exhumations font office de « meilleures pratiques » standardisées favorisant une sortie de conflit. Cette thérapeutique politique peut-elle être mise au service de la lutte et détournée des objectifs réconciliateurs définis ? Cet article analyse le processus d'invention d'un nouveau mode d'action protestataire. Il se centrera sur le travail militant de la Federación Estatal de Foros por la Memoria, collectif espagnol qui interprète l'exhumation comme un outil de lutte permettant de sortir de la réconciliation et de réveiller volontairement les antagonismes. The forensic exhumation of the mass graves has become common practice in post-violent contexts since the 1980s. Being carried out to relieve the psychological "trauma" of the victims' families who demand the "truth" on the past wrongdoings, forensic exhumations are now considered as a standardized "best practice" in the field of conflict resolution. Can this political therapy be put at the service of political strife and diverted from its reconciliation objectives? This article aims at analysing the invention process of a new form of political protest. It will focus on the activities of the Federación Estatal de Foros por la Memoria. According to this Spanish association, mass grave exhumations are a way out of reconciliation and a deliberate revival of antagonisms.<br>

Abstract: This article critically examines the assumptions and processes involved in identifying histoncally distinctive plant identities by their Latin botanical names. By following latecolonial efforts to identify a medicinal herb mentioned in some versions of the Ramayana, this paper argues for a historicist analysis of the process of "retro-botanizing." In so doing, it also distinguishes between two different forms of "tradition," the "factualized" and "embedded." Finally, it blurs the allegedly watertight distinction between histoncal and mythic pasts. Instead of trying to distinguish these pasts ontologically, I argue that it is more productive to see specific pasts in relation to the sorts of futures they produce, that is, their respective historicities.<br>

Author(s): Zembrzycki Stacey<br>
Abstract: Thousands of child Holocaust survivors arrived in Montreal, Quebec, between 1947 and 1952, looking to remake their lives, rebuild their families, and recreate their communities. Integration was not seamless. As survivors struggled to carve spaces for themselves within the established Canadian Jewish community, their difficult wartime stories were neither easily received nor understood. When remembering this period, survivors tend to speak about employment, education, dating, integration into both the pre-war Jewish community and the larger society, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of their own social worlds within existing and new frameworks. Forged in a transitional and tumultuous period in Quebec's history, these social worlds, as this article demonstrates, are an important example of survivor agency. Although survivors recall the ways in which Canadian Jews helped them adjust to their new setting, by organizing a number of programs and clubs within various spaces—Jeanne Mance House, the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Public Library—they also speak about how they forged their own paths upon arriving in this postwar city. For instance, survivors created the New World Club, an informal and grassroots social organization where they could prioritize their own needs and begin to be understood as people, and not just survivors. Establishing the interconnections between these formal and informal social worlds, and specifically, how survivors navigated them, is central to understanding the process through which they were able to move beyond their traumatic pasts and start over. Nightmares and parties are parts of the same story, and here the focus is on the memories of young survivors who prioritized their social worlds. Des milliers d'enfants survivants de l'Holocauste sont arrivés à Montréal, au Québec, entre 1947 et 1952, cherchant à refaire leurs vies, reconstruire leurs familles et recréer leurs communautés.

Author(s): Johnston Erin F.<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with identifying, comparing, and accounting for the principal rhetorical conventions within Pagan practitioners' narratives of conversion. Applying key insights from studies on narrative identity and drawing on 15 months offieldwork and 25 in-depth interviews with Pagan practitioners, I first outline formal similarities in the content of participants' narratives, arguing that these narrative conventions together constitute an ideal typical conversion narrative: what I call the rhetoric of continuity. This narrative form depicts the process of conversion as a rediscovery or uncovering of a temporally continuous and essentialized Pagan self I suggest that while all conversions involve both change and continuity, adherents of different faith traditions vary in the degree to which they stress self-transformation and/or self-continuity. I then argue that the rhetoric of continuity reflects and reinforces practitioners': (1) perspective on the locus and nature of the authentic self; (2) claims to legitimacy and social acceptance: and (3) understanding of the nature of religious truth.<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent developments in epistemology, this work attempts to advance the argument against the use of the medical model in psychology and psychotherapy. This model constitutes a culturally hegemonic interpretation that is epistemologically inadequate and that is an obstacle to the process of psychological change, both outside and within the context of the therapeutic relationship. Phenomena currently interpreted as "psychiatric disorders" can more adequately and constructively be made sense of with the use of categories derived from the cultural understanding of the processes of growth and education. It is proposed that widespread problems of life are not symptoms of an epidemic of mental illness but signs that humanity is involved in a process of evolution.<br>

Abstract: In spite of its classical framework, the inner directions and the narrative of Bartók's music are unconventional; they are unusual even in the context of twentieth-century music. By inner direction and narrative I mean those features of the music that determine the flow of the musical process, such as: balance between static and dynamic sections, distribution of thematic and transitional materials, proportions, development toward climax and the placing of climaxes, the logic in the sequence of musical character, strategies for opening and ending a composition, and so on. In these aspects, Bartók's forms are deeply alien to Classical and, for the most part, even to Romantic thinking.<br>

Abstract: Using postwar El Salvador as a case study, I argue against the dominant paradigm that situates the repressive role of the state as both the central object of memorialization and the main subject of history. Instead, I focus on the ways in which the memory of insurgent collective action is constructed among young members of the popular classes in postwar El Salvador. Drawing on extensive ethnographic research in the communities of northern Morazán, I understand memory as the suspended time of praxis. Media—such as Internet, Facebook, and TV play a key role in this process, impinging on the ways youth relate with the revolutionary past of their relatives making sense of their present living conditions. I argue that memory must be understood as a particular form of praxis, one that is embedded in historic concrete forms of class constitution in which the role of media has become a constitutive element in the labors of memory, particularly among young people.<br>

Abstract: The long lasting wave of Italian refugees, returning to their homeland at the conclusion of World War II and during the decolonization process, arises many questions. First of all the demographical dimension is still unclear, and figures given by historians may present relevant variations. In the second place, their arrival has compelled the administration and political power to better define the boundaries of citizenship, and the answers given to the refugees show the cultural limits of citizenship in our country. Moreover, since the many arrivals have received different reactions by their fellow citizens, from solidarity to annoyance, questions concern the reasons of these different behaviours. Finally, recent historical research has shown that the construction of the public memory of refugees has been a sensible political issue in every country. In the case of Italian expellees, the different levels of attention paid to them show that political support and memory depended mainly on their possible exploitation for territorial claims. When they were considered useless for this purpose, they were not included in the public memory and also historical research has been directed to them with an inexcusable delay.<br>

Author(s): Araral Eduardo<br>
Abstract: The first-generation literature on policy design has made considerable contributions over the last 30 years to our understanding of the process, politics and implications of policy design and instrument choice. This literature, however, has generally treated institutions as a black box and has not developed a coherent set of frameworks, theories and models of how institutions matter to policy design. In this paper, I unpack the black box of institutions using transaction cost and mechanism design to show how regulations can be better designed in developing countries when institutions are weak, unaccountable, corrupted or not credible. Under these conditions, I show that efficient regulatory design has to minimize transaction costs, particularly agency problems, by having incentive compatible (self-enforcing) mechanisms. I conclude with a second-generation research agenda on regulatory design with implications for environmental, food and drug safety, healthcare and financial regulation in developing countries.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines key implications of praxis theory for applied anthropology. I am concerned with applied anthropology as a communicative and collaborative process and with a critical understanding of the anthropologist's role as consultant, practitioner, and analyst in processes of planned change. The use of praxis as a central analytic leitmotif places "practical" activity, informed by theory, at the center of applied research. The analysis is illustrated through a description of a multi-disciplinary, community-based health research and planning project in seven native communities in Ontario. I examine how practical knowledge and action constrains and transforms academic models of community based development.<br>

Abstract: Sacred music has always been a source of controversy throughout history since it is an integral part of the liturgy. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has reached a pinnacle of controversy as its realm of consumption expands globally and inter-denominationally. This study was inspired by the idea of Ricoeur's phenomenology of religion to examine the contemporary practice of liturgy and sacred music. This brings into discussion the historical controversy and cultural milieu of adopting popular culture into youth ministry. Korean case is important because Korea represents one of the strongest Christian populations in the world and at the same time challenges - a drop in the number of young members and a huge generational gap in its church congregations. In order to scrutinize the concrete process of youth culture in the Christian community, an empirical study of youth ministry in seven mega churches in Seoul in South Korean was conducted as a case study. Sakralna glazba oduvijek je tijekom povijesti bila izvor kontroverzi jer predstavlja integrálni dio liturgije, a povijest glazbe je iz nje izrasla. Suvremena kršèanska glazba dostigla je vrhunac kontroverzije kad se njezino potrošaèko podruèje proširilo globalno i medukonfesionalno. Ovaj je članak nastao na temelju Ricoeurove fenomenologije religije i nastoji ispitati suvremenu praksu u liturgiji i sakralnoj glazbi u svjetlu nasljeda povijesne kontroverze i kultúrne sredine u prihvaćanju populárne kultúre u mladenačkoj službi božjoj. Teologija glazbe, o kojoj su raspravljali u 16. stoljeèu Luther, Zwingli i Calvin, osobito je korisna za konzultiranje pri suvremenom prilagodavanju na populárnu kulturu u crkvi. Štoviše, humanizam usaden u liturgijsku reformaciju u razdoblju renesanse otvára filozofijsko pitanje čovjekova identiteta pred licem božanskoga, o èemu se raspravljalo tijekom moderne i postmoderne povijesti sve do danas. Kako bi se pažljivo ispitao konkrétni proces mladenačke kulture u kršćanskoj zajednici, pr~<br>

Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: Après une période de recherches homilétiques marquées par le paradigme de la crise, l'actuelle synergie de travaux dynamiques sur la prédication laisse supposer que l'on aborde le temps de la construction d'un nouveau modèle. l'article s'inscrit dans ce mouvement et propose d'envisager la prédication comme conversation et comme reconnaissance: conversation initiatique d'abord, puis herméneutique, en particulier par un travail d'intertextualité et de partage des voix. La dernière partie dégage la notion de reconnaissance, élément fondamental, pour ne pas dire «sacramentel», de la réception homilétique. Enfin, pour provoquer le dialogue entre texte biblique et réflexion homilétique, l'argumentation s'appuie sur la trame du récit des pèlerins d'Emmaiis (Lc 24,13-33), récit-métaphore d'un processus homilétique renouvelé. After a period of homiletic research marked by the paradigm of crisis, todays dynamic synergy on the subject of preaching suggests the construction of a new model. Along this line, Graesslé's article envisages preaching as conversation and as acknowledgment : first comes initiatory conversation, than hermeneutics, particulary by the effort to relate texts and separate voices. The last part draws out the fundamental, if not «sacramental», element of acknowledgment in homiletic reception. The web of the story about the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24,13-33), a metaphor for a renewed process of homiletics, is taken to provoke dialogue between the biblical text and homiletic reflection.<br>

Abstract: Les Lumières européennes provoquent un double déplacement des coordonnées socio-culturelles dans lesquelles s'inscrit le christianisme : la critique rationnelle de la religion et la privatisation du croire induisent un processus de sécularisation auquel le christianisme doit réagir. Pour ce faire, le protestantisme développe une théorie du christianisme dont Kant, Schleiermacher et Hegel formulent les paradigmes. C'est au gré d'une reprise sélective de ces trois penseurs qu' au cours du XIXe et du XXe siècle le protestantisme allemand se positionnera au sein du monde moderne, s'efforçant d'identifier les sphères socio-culturelles lui permettant de faire valoir le thème où se jouent tant sa vérité théologique que sa pertinence socio-culturelle : la liberté. Ce cadre théorique permet d'expliciter ce qu'il en est de concepts souvent galvaudés : théologie libérale, Kulturprotestantismus, néo-protestantisme. The European enlightenment provoked a double displacement of the social and cultural components of Christianity : rationalist criticism of religion and the privatisation of belief led to a process of secularization to which Christianity had to react. To do so, Protestantism developed a theory of Christianity based on paradigms formulated by Kant, Schleiermacher and Hegel. It was through a selective return to these three thinkers that in the 19th and 20th centuries, German Protestantism took a position in the modern world, trying to identify those social and cultural spheres which would foster a theme essential to both its theological truth and its social-cultural pertinence : the theme of freedom. This theoretical framework allowed it to explain often tarnished concepts such as liberal theology, Kulturprotestantismus, neo-protestantism.<br>

Abstract: Masking is ubiquitous to the culture areas of the world and is a symbolic activity inextricably associated cross-culturally with cosmological drama and shamanic ritual. Our question is, "Masks work how?" In Part 1, we place masks within their physical, cultural and cosmological context so as to view the activity of masking as part of a wider symbolic process. Masks are seen to be transformations of face. In Part 2, the work of masking is realized as a transformation of experience, and is related to a general cycle of meaning in culture whereby cosmological beliefs give rise to direct experience, and experience verifies and vivifies cosmology. And in Part 3 the "how" of masking is explained using a biogenetic structural perspective which traces the possible transformations of brain that may occur within the wearer and audience and that may mediate a variety of mask-related experiences.<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Abstract: De François Wahl à Jürgen Habermas, la critique de la cratologie de Foucault a beaucoup évolué. Mais si Foucault n'apparaît plus comme un phénoménologue honteux de la volonté de puissance, trahissant ses prétentions structuralistes, il reste quand même un penseur ambigu qui, à la manière de Heidegger, élabore un discours « empirico - existentiel » à l'aide de catégories « historico-transcendantales ». Pourtant, si la critique habermassienne a le mérite d'attirer l'attention sur un trait central de la modernité que Foucault laisse de côté — la « solidification » des structures collectives —, elle ne nous offre pas, comme la critique de Foucault, les moyens de résister au processus d'intégration et de cristallisation des structures modernes, mais semble plutôt entériner la suprématie du savoir moderne de la contrainte par les structures institutionnelles. Pour notre part, nous pensons qu'une philosophie politique doit répondre, à notre époque, au problème relevé par Habermas avec les méthodes de contestation employées par Foucault. Cette philosophie politique devra même tenir compte, en tant que reflet de la situation actuelle, de l'ignorance de Foucault quant au problème crucial de la logique institutionnelle moderne et du refus par Habermas de toute critique qui vise à produire un conflit avec la logique dominante d'intégration. From François Wahl to Jürgen Habermas, criticisms of Foucault's theory of power have evolved considerably. But although Foucault may no longer be seen as a phenomenologist ashamed of his preoccupation about power, thus undermining his structuralist prétentions, he nevertheless remains an ambiguous thinker who, in the manner of Heidegger, elaborates an empirico-existential argument with the help of historico-transcendental classifications. However, if Habermas's criticism has the merit of drawing attention to a basic feature of modernity which Foucault leaves aside — namely the "solidification" of collective structures — it fails to offer, as~<br>

Abstract: This introduction of the HSR Special Issue on "Critique and Social Change: Historical, Cultural, and Institutional Perspectives" addresses the question of how critique and social change are interrelated. Conflicts and disputes are considered to be a major source of critique. We distinguish three types of conflicts: (1) Value conflicts result from the ongoing process of rationalization and the differentiation of relatively autonomous "value spheres" (Weber) such as politics, economy, science, law, etc. (2) The growth and expansion of these value spheres, e.g. the growth of capitalism, in turn produce new forms of inequalities and leads to distributional conflicts. (3) As questions of distribution and inclusion are closely linked, critique also originates from identity conflicts, which address the social recognition of individuals and collectivities. In order to understand how critique is related to social change, we suggest that critique can be studied either as a condition for or as an effect from social change. Based on this distinction we provide an overview over the contributions of this volume.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i405180<br>
Date: 9 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): van DongenAbstract: In this article, I consider narratives told within a clinical setting. I argue that personnel in a day center for people with acquired brain damage are constantly involved in narrating about the disabled participants. The negotiation of who the participant is, and foremost will be, is in constant negotiation in regard to issues of hope. I further argue that hope is a meaning-making process and, as such, it has been defined as crucially connected to time. Hope has been said to enable a connection between the present and the future, because action taken in the present could bring about (positive) change in the future. However, I show that hope, in relation to narratives told about people with severe disabilities that are considered "incurable," must be understood within a realm of narrative foreclosure. Time seems to have lost the openness of its horizon for these people, and a narrative that tells of immediacy rather than chronology is created, resulting in hope being established within the present.<br>

Author(s): Joad Jonathan<br>
Abstract: Recognizing the contingent entanglement between historiography's social and political roles and the conception of the discipline as purely factual, this essay provides a detailed analysis of "revision" and its connection to "revisionism." This analysis uses a philosophical approach that begins with the commonplaces of our understanding as expressed in dictionaries, which are compared and contrasted to display relevant confusions. The essay then turns to examining the questions posed by History and Theory's Call for Papers announcing its Theme Issue on Revision in History, and, where philosophically relevant, answers them. The issue of paradigm change proved to be quite significant and required particular attention. A "paradigm" is analyzed in terms of Quine's "web of belief," and that web is itself explained as an ongoing process of revision, in analogy with Rawls's concept of pure procedural justice. Adopting this approach helps clarify the entanglement between politics and historiographical revision.<br>

Abstract: With positivist and technocratic notions still prevalent, Paul Healy's (1986) insightful effort to advance "interpretive policy inquiry" both underscores the limitations of conventional analysis and helps us to grasp the policy process in human terms. Yet the article falls short of a systematic presentation of the interpretive position and, in doing so, reveals the limitations of that approach: the need for an explicitly critical posture becomes clear. This point is made with particular attention to a pre-positivist figure, Machiavelli.<br>

Author(s): NeutresAbstract: En adaptant Le Parrain, le best-seller de Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola est confronté à plusieurs récits-I'histoire de la Mafia américaine, son imagerie mythique, I'interrogation identitaire italo-américaine-, auxquels il mêle des souvenirs personnels et l'héritage culturel légué par sa communauté. Dépassant la simple commande commerciale, il réussit à établir à l'écran, via la fiction, sa part de vérité. Le premier film sera complété par deux suites. Le temps de constitution de cette trilogie, près de vingt ans, renvoie à deux autres durées exceptionnellement longues: la durée du métrage final des trois films (près de neufheures) et celle de la période décrite (quatre-vingt ans de l'histoire des États-Unis). Brisant la linéarité classique, la trilogie du Parrain souligne la pertinence de l'outil cinématographique dans la construction d'un récit aux temporalités multiples. Ces temporalités concernent aussi bien le spectateur que le cinéaste lui-même, comme nous l'indique l'édition DVD, outil précieux pour une analyse historienne. Face à ses propres images, Coppola transforme la «revision» en travail de mémoire: manière supplémentaire de surmonter l'apparent paradoxe entre le film hollywoodien et le récit intime. /// Whilst adapting The Godfather, Mario Puzo's bestselling novel, Francis Ford Coppola was faced with several stories-the history of the American Mafia, the mythical image associated with it, the questioning of Italian-American identity-which he managed to combine with his own life experiences and the cultural legacy inherited from his own community. Going beyond a simple commissioned film, he succeeds in transposing onto screen, through fiction, his very own truth. This first installment was complemented by two sequels. The twenty-year time-frame within which this trilogy was made is echoed by two other remarkably long periods: the full running-time of the three films when viewed consecutively (close to nine hours) and the historical period within which~<br>

Abstract: This article is an ethnographic exploration of the process through which citizens come to conceptualize their identities as political subjects in rapidly changing contexts. The focus of the article is the lifting, in 2003, of a ban on crossing between the northern and southern parts of the island of Cyprus, which had been instituted in 1974. The article examines how this new political change affected state rhetoric, and concentrates on the reactions of Greek-Cypriot citizens to this shift. These data are related to the wider discussion on the political theory of subjectivity and the concept of 'event', where, it is argued, anthropology has a significant contribution to make. / Le présent article est une exploration ethnographique des processus par lequel les citoyens en viennent à conceptualiser leurs identités comme sujets politiques dans des contextes de changements rapides. Il est centré sur l'abolition, en 2003, de l'interdiction de passage imposée en 1974 entre les parties Nord et Sud de L'île de Chypre. L'auteur examine la manière dont ce nouveau changement politique a affecté la rhétorique étatique, et se concentre sur les réactions des Chypriotes Grecs à cette évolution. Ces données sont replacées dans un cadre de discussion plus large sur la théorie politique de la subjectivité et le concept « d'événement », auquel l'anthropologie peut, selon l'auteur, apporter une contribution importante.<br>

Abstract: The frames that Lewis Carroll provided for the two Alice books have largely been ignored, when not simply dismissed, in recent Carroll criticism. Their conventional form and diction may account for this negative response, but examination of their provenance, their function within the structure of the two books, and the artistry evident in the individual frame components indicate how and why the frames are important to our understanding of Carroll's vision and purpose. The frame poems are designed to lead the reader into and away from the central dream tales through a process of lyric transformation and estrangement.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>

Date: 3 1, 1957<br>
Author(s): Woollcombe Regina M.<br>
Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Author(s): Thiongo Sabry<br>
Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Abstract: This article develops parallels between how individuals make sense of both lived experience and narrative performance in order to suggest how the process of following a narrative can give rise to affectively engaging states of mind or flows of thought that I term experiential meanings. Although potentiated through the artistry of performance, these meanings result from listeners' own interpretational processes and therefore become experiential resources available for use in their lives.<br>

Author(s): Zharova James V.<br>
Abstract: An approach to sociocultural analysis based on the ideas of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and others is used to provide the foundation for discussing narratives as "cultural tools." The production of official, state sponsored historical narratives is examined from this perspective, and it is argued that this production process may be shaped as much by dialogic encounters with other narratives as by archival information. These claims are harnessed to examine the production of post-Soviet Russian history textbooks, especially their presentation of the events surrounding the Russian Civil War of 1918-20.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>

Date: 9 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Winnicott Allen<br>
Abstract: Psychoanalytic anthropologists assume that folktales often reflect unconscious beliefs and attitudes of listeners, who can tolerate anxiety-provoking images and messages (perhaps wish fulfillments) because these have been projected at a safe distance into the characters in the story. Here I argue that our theory for how such a process occurs is inadequate in terms of contemporary psychoanalytic theory. We need to reexamine a number of questions for which we may have assumed we already have answers, including the nature of repression and how it is accomplished; who or what "hears" an unconscious idea that has been collectively repressed when it is expressed in a folktale; and whether Freud's structural model of id-ego-super-ego can provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding how unconscious ideas find their way into "expressive culture." I examine these questions in light of a folktale collected among Brazilian peasants. I conclude by questioning the central importance of the ego in repression, and propose a concept of a whole, or supraordinate, self to describe the actual agency in charge of repression.<br>

Author(s): Whitten Michael F.<br>
Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Date: 11 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Thompson Paul<br>
Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Author(s): Williams Robert<br>
Abstract: An ethnographic study of a shelter in downtown Boston for people considered homeless and mentally ill documents the way in which the category of "experience," which many have taken to be universal and natural, is culturally and historically constituted. The residents of the shelter tend not to experience - defined here as an inwardly reflexive process that proceeds, coheres, and transforms through temporally integrative forms - but rather "struggle along" by way of an acutely tactile mode of perception that attends to episodic, temporally finite encounters. The fact that experience in the shelter is only a possibility, not a given, points to the need for a critical phenomenology that would help us to consider how this and other ways of being come about through specific social, cultural, political, and material forces.<br>

Author(s): Žižek Georgina<br>
Abstract: This essay uses the work of psychoanalyst Melanie Klein to reopen the dialogue between anthropology and psychoanalysis. It argues that Kleinian concepts enhance an anthropology that seeks out both intersubjective and intrasubjective difference and disjuncture, and it demonstrates the uses of major Kleinian concepts for addressing classic anthropological problems, including gender classification and the analysis of persecution in witchcraft and sorcery systems. Applying Kleinian concepts to the analysis of cultural-historical process, it shows how splitting and denial may be central to the reproduction and hegemony of dominant cultural systems through time and addresses the question of how to theorize the relationship among dominant cultural systems, social differentiation, and individual subjectivities.<br>

Abstract: Graph-related practices are central to scientific endeavors, and graphing has long been hailed as one of the core "general process skills" that set scientists apart. We use two case studies from a large study among scientists to exemplify our findings that graphing is not a context-independent skill. Rather, scientists' competencies with respect to graph interpretation are highly contextual and are a function of their familiarity with the phenomena to which the graph pertains. If graphing practices are not general but are tied to embodied understandings and familiarity with representation practices, then there are implications for teaching graphing in school mathematics and science settings.<br>

Abstract: Jurisprudence traditionally approaches the law as an external object; the jurisprudential scholar generally seeks to describe legal doctrine in terms of its objective and observable properties. Professor Balkin argues that seemingly fixed, inherent characteristics of legal doctrine-most notably, whether or not a given body of law is "coherent" or possesses "integrity"-are better understood as projections from the individual observer. Judgments about legal coherence are in reality the result of only one of many interpretive postures an observer might take, but one that implicates the integrity of the observer's own world view. Furthermore, this process of interpretation does not leave the observer untouched, for the process of interpretation itself constructs the observer.<br>

Publisher: CODESRIA<br>

Author(s): Aliana Serge Bernard Emmanuel<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the concepts of deliberative democracy and African palaver to conceptually (re) formulate and make intelligible the practices and performance of governance in Africa, with the aim of achieving a genuine normalization of societal behavior. Based on an analysis of the texts and a synthesis of texts analyzed, and drawing on the evidence at the present time, this is about establishing that the African palaver, often excluded from the cartography of official epistemology and relegated to the level of indigenous knowledge and practice, can define the conditions of possibility and feasibility for deliberative democracy, a political paradigm deemed dominant universal. However, the issue is that of cognitive decentering. How can one imagine that African conceptual categories, labeled as cheesy and reduced to the mere field of ethnological studies, can interact and correlate with modern recipes, with the idea of starting a process of governability, the realization of which is resilient democracy?<br>

Author(s): Soto Ana María Riveros<br>
Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: Allusion and citation in Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongueexplicitly works to harness cultural capital from the literary canon. As she puts it, her poems are squatters in the house of language: “We have been linguistic squatters, possessing adversely what is truly ours.”
               This appropriation is of a piece with what Oswald De Andrade and K. Silem Mohammad are about in their splicing of Shakespeare, which I mentioned at the outset. In130
            Sonnagrams, Mohammad combines aleatory procedures with the strict observance of traditional meter and rhyme in his recombination of Shakespeare's sonnets. Somewhat like Pierre Menard's re-authoring ofDon Quixote, Mohammad sought to create new poems that were “quantitatively equivalent to Shakespeare's poems,” although this meant they were equivalent only “at the most basic linguistic level: the letter.” Mohammad explains his combinatorial process: “I feed each of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets one line at a time into an internet anagram engine … thus generating a new list of words from each line … The textual output … gives me a bank of raw material.”
               A quatrain from sonnet #3 (“Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest”) becomes:131
            
               As Heather McHugh puts it, Mohammad offers an “anagram as scrupulous as it is full of slang and sass.”Go softly to the Disneyland Hotel,

               Mohammad notes that he's not interested in being “overtly influenced by Shakespeare's semantic content.”133
            
               His re-authoring is, moreover, consciously situated within a tradition of anagrams (especially those of Ferdinand De Saussure) and rewritings of Shakespeare's sonnets (he names Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Jen B~<br>

Abstract: The second half of the narrative (chapters 6–8) creates a strong movement and longing back to this textual hyper-memory, both voluntarily and involuntarily. The style of the narration is more distanced, reflective, mimetic, and filled with direct speech and flashbacks that slow down its speed. The past textual memory in the reader is not only evoked through the very change of style, but also through the reuse of common symbols that were developed in the first part. This strategy is called literary distance. This division mimics that of the division of the nostalgic reaction. The first part represents the happiness of the memory, and the second part illustrates the melancholic reflection on this memory. Thus, the process of reading
      Gatsbyis similar to the process of a nostalgic reaction. One way to dramatize how these halves function is through Leonard Baird's description of the structure ofGatsbyas a party followed by a hangover: “[W]hen you get through with the story you feel as if you'd been some place where you had a good time, but now entertain grave doubts as to the quality of the synthetic gin” (208). The sense of a party giving way to a hangover corresponds very well with the binaries of presence and distance.<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: The 1971 article focused on three major points: (1) Africa as historical reality and religious image; (2) the involuntary presence of the African American community in the United States; and (3) the experience and symbol of God in the experience of blacks; these points overlap. I pointed out how Africa for African Americans was obviously a reference to the continent of Africa but that it was that and more. It became an image and symbol for the possibility for another and alternative beginning and way of being in the world. Africa was indeed a continent with a very large landmass and simultaneously the basis for a powerful orienting discourse about the nature and being of peoples of African descent in the world. The involuntary stance and presence of African people in their diasporic existence in the New World is paralleled by the destruction of aboriginal peoples and acquisition of their lands. These events have prevented any ultimate trust in the rhetorics of egalitarianism and freedom that accompanied the ascendancy of Europe. The manifestation and naming of gods and divine beings as centering symbols of the orientational process express themselves in a precise manner within this situation and become the resource for the maintenance of one's humanity within the context.<br>

Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

Abstract: Psychoanalysis gives us a way of addressing the tension between ethics and politics that springs the trap of this double bind. The pledge of psychoanalysis is to critically examine how we project our unconscious fears and desires onto others whom we call foreigners, enemies, monsters, deserving some form of death penalty. It commands us to investigate how we distribute dignity, equality, and respect such that some profit while others pay the price. The psychoanalytic supplement binds ethics to politics without appeals to the soveriegnty of the will or of God but, rather, through the interminable process of analyzing the ways in which we disavow and avow our investments in violence and cruelty.<br>

Abstract: Of course, it is obvious that we come to know “persons” (or “personal I's”) by a process of comparison, that is, we understand persons not merely as what “I” refers to but as what I's have, what Husserl would call their “habitualities.” That is, we refer to them as beings in the world with others. In this respect knowing persons is indeed a matter of an identification of someone by
            per accidens individuation. The distinguishing properties that single me out for myself and for you in terms of bodily shape, species or kind, face, psychical and moral traits, gender, profession, autobiography, ethnicity, nationality, locality, place in time, and so on and so forth are a matter of individuationper accidensor of relating me or the other person to what is other than me or other than she or he. Yet, if we may consider the hypothesis that there is a sense in which what “I” refers to is not a mere bundle or constellation of properties (which in principle is repeatable), we may entertain a sense in which what/whom “I” refers to is nonsortal—nonpropertied—and this may give us reason to pause in thinking ofpersonsimply as a sortal term.<br>

Abstract: That period (1980–81) symbolized the end of the “then” period. Critical theory, with its close ties to the interpretation of Marx, was no longer front and center. But the idea of critique was still alive, or at least we thought that it could be kept alive given the ominous truth of criticism that associated critique and ideology (Gadamer). At least we tried. Some four years after the publication of the first issue of
            Cultural Hermeneutics, Reidel, the publisher, suddenly and with little warning discontinued the journal. Whether it was Reidel's penchant for the good life or that we were the lowest journal in the hierarchy I never knew, but this much was clear, unless something unusual happened my life as a journal editor was over. As I was mulling over what to do, a process that took months, I received a late-night call from a former graduate student who was on his way to a distinguished career. His question was simple: “Dave, if you give up, where are we going to get published?” I took the question seriously; I bit the bullet, as it were—whoever said something could not be created out of nothing—and I started a publishing company to privately publish my journal. And by the most unusual stroke of luck I and the grad students associated with me at the time changed the nameCultural HermeneuticstoPhilosophy and Social Criticism. Unbelievably the phrase “social criticism” had not yet caught the public's imagination, and the choice of title was a stroke of pure luck. Significantly this change of title marked a transition in my view of critical theory, as reflected in the new editorial statement: “In modern industrial society reason cannot be separated from practical life. At their interface a critical attitude is forged.” The statement, which now sounds a bit passé, though I still keep it on the masthead, takes its distance from the earlier phase of critical theory. No revolution in the nineteenth-century historical sense is to be expected here. Social critici~<br>

Abstract: Let me turn away now from discontinuity, rupture, coming-apart, to recall a philosophical coming-together, Elizabeth Grosz's 2010 SPEP plenary, “Matter, Life, and Other Variations,” in which she presented a prospectus for an enormous ontological project: “I want to think a concept of matter that has not yet cut itself off from that which it opposes, matter that is not defined as the
         absenceof mind, life, Idea, form, or Spirit…. What I am seeking is a new concept of matter that also involves something incorporeal, a spark of virtuality that enables life to emerge” (2011, 17). Grosz returns to Darwin (as in her 2004 and 2005 books), reading him as a theorist of sexual difference. Elaborating this reading through Bergson, Deleuze, Simondon, and contemporary physics, she gives us a look into a radically different material world, a physical world of differing in a process of “endless becomings” (2011, 23).<br>

Abstract: More recently a series of atheistic and materialist interpretations of Saint Paul have arisen, beginning with Alain Badiou's
         The Universalism of St. Paul, according to which Paul is an exemplar of the galvanized subjectivity that is required by a truth process. Paul's letters are a journal of the transformation of the subject under the impact of the event, which produces an apostolic mission to establish the universality of the truth. The universality of the truth event is achieved in a process of the subtraction of ethnic particularity, resulting in a reign of truth where there is neither Greek nor Jew, male nor female, master nor slave. Of course, the content of Paul's letters, the resurrection of Jesus, is not the truth but a fable, but it is in the form of the truth. Slavoj Žižek contributes to this debate by way of an unorthodox version of Hegel read through Lacan, the watchword of which is Lacan's saying that the therapy is over when the patient realizes that there is no Big Other. The final words of Jesus on the cross, “My God, why have you forsaken me?” bear witness to the final atheistic conversion of Jesus, when God himself ceases to believe in God, leaving behind the community of those who, having assumed responsibility for themselves, set out to produce a radical egalitarian socialist order.

Author(s): Steinbock Anthony<br>
Abstract: Our third plenary session in 2013 was a new part of the program, the Co-director's Address. Modeled somewhat loosely on the APA Presidential Address, this session was designed to offer the outgoing co-director the chance to speak to the whole membership either about his or her own work or about a reflection on the state of the discipline. Anthony Steinbock, as outgoing co-director, chose the latter approach for his address, though his article, “SPEP and the Continental Divide,” clearly shows that the question of the identity and orientation of SPEP as an organization is as much philosophical as it is practical. Tracing distinct phases in the history of SPEP, Steinbock argues that SPEP's distinctive orientation is its openness to experience. This openness to experience is, of course, central to the methodology of phenomenology, but over the years maintaining this orientation has also pushed SPEP to be open to new styles and currents of thought that go beyond phenomenology. To be sure, this has at times been a conflictual process, as Steinbock recounts, but it has also been one that remains true to SPEP's core animating impulse. However, Steinbock also maintains that this fundamental internal openness and rootedness in experience compels us to resist the strict and dogmatic identification of SPEP with “continental philosophy,” especially where this is understood as the Other of “analytic philosophy.”<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutics, moreover, challenges the central role that Husserl ascribes to intuition, especially in his early works. The call to return to the things themselves is heeded by a return to what is given in intuition. But, as Ricoeur puts it, “the Husserlian demand for the return to intuition is countered by the necessity for all understanding to be mediated by an interpretation.”
         
               In support of this claim, Ricoeur draws inspiration from Heidegger's conception of the as-structure of being, which maintains that being is always revealed in a partial manner, as this or as that.13
            
               This as-structure suggests that nothing is ever directly or fully given, and for this reason, what is given always calls for a process of interpretation enabling it to be seen as this or that. If it is the case that all givenness is perspectival and partial, Ricoeur contends that phenomenology “cannot constitute itself without a14
            hermeneutical presupposition. The hermeneutical condition of phenomenology is linked to the role ofAuslegungin the fulfillment of its philosophical project.”

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Tragic optimism is an oxymoron entirely consonant with Shaw's customary mode of analysis: dialectical (both/and) thinking. Shaw was well aware that the historical record revealed precious little to demonstrate that humankind had made substantive progress in reducing unwarranted pain, suffering, and injustice. As his urbane Devil so eloquently puts it in
         Man and Superman, if the race excels at one particular thing it is in perfecting ever more efficient means of wreaking destruction on a massive scale and not in honing the executive skills necessary for peacefully achieving the humane society. Moreover, without a vibrant socialism to vitiate the dark side of capitalism, an eventuality that with every passing day seemed to him more and more remote, Shaw saw few if any signs that the desperate conditions of the victimized, whose numbers were growing at an alarming rate, were likely to improve. Even his flirtations with the ruling dictators of the period failed to produce the consummation he devoutly desired. In the main, humans generally struck him as simply too immature, selfish, and shortsighted to manage their affairs wisely. Hence, it is not surprising that the Shavian corpus, for all its sparkling wit and polemical precision, includes a palpable strain of simmering pessimism. At the same time, however, Shaw was not one iota less optimistic that life, in strictly biological terms, would continue to evolve unabated, one species supplanting another through the eons. As Lilith—Shaw's embodiment of the Life Force—declares in her statement that concludesBack to Methuselah, “Of life only is there no end.”
               Barring a cataclysm of biblical proportions, Shaw believed that life was indestructible. Therefore, to his way of thinking, the best use of human energy and talent lies in doing everything possible to assist the forward movement of evolution as it wends its way through the generations. In the Shavian universe, the operative principle is that livi~<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Abstract: This unceasing flow is precisely what, according to Julia Kristeva, articulates the semiotic function of writing in what she calls a “pulsating
         chora”
               —an idea glossed by Brivic as “the level of maternal pulsation in language.”158
            
               Kristeva identifies this159
            choraas a “totality formed by the [semiotic] drives … in a motility that is as full of movement as it is regulated.”
               She cites Joyce's work as representative of that rare set of literary texts that “cover the infinity of the [signifying] process, that is, reach the semiotic160
            chora.”
               In that Joyce's writing confronts patriarchal regulation with this deconstructive, progressive, and chaotic flow, its attraction to feminist theorists is clear: as Brivic notes, “Joyce's experiments directly inspired two of the leading thinkers of the161
            écriture fémininemovement, Hélène Cixous and Julia Kristeva.”
               Like poststructuralist feminism, Joyce's work advances a mode of Utopianism that necessarily resists categorization. In discussing her notion of162
            écriture féminine(a literary form in which she includes Joyce's work—indeed she wrote her doctoral thesis on Joyce),
               Hélène Cixous has suggested that it is impossible to define such modes of writing and that “this is an impossibility that will remain, for this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded—which doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.”163
            
               While Herbert Marcuse may have suggested that the Utopian is validated by its categorization as such (and thereby by its exclusion from normative, hegemonic discourse), the mode of Utopianism expressed by Kristeva's164
            choraor Cixous'sécriture féminineis validated by virtue of the fact that it cannot be so categorized. Like Joyce's “word known to all men,”
               Utopia is too fluid for such reductive definition.165<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: But the emphasis on failure as a product of design, or as a consequence of somehow having arrived at the wrong style, arguably forecloses on utopian possibility in architecture. As K. G. Bristol observes, adoption of the demolition of Pruitt-Igoe as representative of the failings of modern architecture, and as a marker of its demise, has at its core “the idea that architectural design was responsible for the demise of Pruitt-Igoe.”
         
               Hiding in this insight is a contribution to sharpening an understanding of just how Utopia might be alternatively construed in architecture, shedding light on how any understanding of Utopia that begins and ends with form (with design), with representation or spatial closure alone, really must be abandoned before Utopia can make a meaningful contribution to imagining architecture and the city in all their depth. As noted earlier, Harvey has conceptualized a first step in this direction in his development of “dialectical utopianism,” which turns on the necessity for “spatial closure” to be adjoined with the equal necessity of “social process” in the proposition of any Utopia that might take a concrete form.23<br>

Abstract: In this article, Ilya Kliger and Nasser Zakariya treat Lev Tolstoi’s conception of brotherhood from a narratological perspective. In the process, they trace the outlines of late Tolstoian narrative poetics, situating it within a variegated landscape of Tolstoi’s own more properly “realist” literary practice, and offering broader suggestions on the workings of narrative in its capacity to model social relations and ethical action. A narratological focus here allows them to elucidate how stories take part in contemporary understandings of social influence, human connectedness, and alienation—not only on the level of themes but also, and more deeply, on the level of the narrative organization of events. Their main focus is on one of Tolstoi’s late novellas “The Forged Coupon” and his last novel
         Resurrection.<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements.

Abstract: Examining Agamben's reception of Hannah Arendt, and especially
         The Human Condition, in his theorization of biopolitics, this essay argues thatHomo Sacer I, by identifying Arendt with a quasi-Straussian “political philosophy,” fails to acknowledge the complexity of her conception of history. Far from simply affirming the normative force of classical political categories, Arendt regards these as emerging from a living power of distinction that thinking, by showing the historical process that brings about the effacement of these distinctions, seeks to bring into view. Nevertheless, Arendt's conception of history is not without contradiction: while arguing that metaphysics went astray by subordinating praxis to poiesis, her very account of history suggests that this subordination is inevitable, since only a “poetic,” indeed violent, act of making a distinction can distinguish praxis from poiesis. Precisely this problem lies at the center of Agamben's early engagement with Arendt inThe Man without Content.<br>
