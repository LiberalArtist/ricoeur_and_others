  Abstract: “Two more private and particular considerations encouraged me in the work. The first, that I am a Spaniard; the second, that I am a priest of the Society of Jesus.”¹ Such was the explanation offered by the priest and scholar Pedro de Ribadeneyra (1526–1611) for the production of the
                  Historia eclesiastica del scisma del reyno de Inglaterra(henceforth, the “Historia”), his polemical account of the English Reformation. Troublingly, virtually all scholarship on theHistoriahas concentrated on the former factor, to the detriment of our appreciation of the latter.

  Abstract: In a 1917 issue of the journal
                  Housing Betterment,the editors reprinted a section of Governor Martin Brumbaugh’s annual message to Pennsylvanians. At one moment in the address, Governor Brumbaugh proposed a statewide housing code to preserve the health of the populace. As the governor affirmed the responsibilities of the state toward residents, he hailed proper living conditions as requisite to the production of stronger citizens. In particular, he heavily promoted these standards for the populace of ethnic neighborhoods, stating, “We are not Americanizing our new-coming immigrants if we allow them to live in what is often termed the ‘black<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: Since 1961, Girard’s production has grown without interruption, to at least the same degree as his fame. Without doubt, the fascination with Girard’s thought derives from the fact that he has constructed a true “speculative cathedral,” a theory that proposes to explain everything from myths to rituals, Greek tragedies to modern novels, holocausts of historical magnitude to everyday customs. At first glance, it would seem that Girard has changed little or nothing of his speculative construction since then, but if we look closely, there are noticeable problems and corrections that threaten the very foundations of mimetic theory. Indeed, recent criticism<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7rg">The Cosmic Time of Empire</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the “hallmarks of modernity,” writes Henri Lefebvre in his 1974 study,
                  The Production of Space,is its “expulsion” or “erasure” of time. Inscribed in spaces and in social relationships in the premodern, time in modernity is subordinated to the economic and expelled from the political. In deliberately violent imagery Lefebvre writes that time in modernity “has been murdered by society” (96). If this separation of time from space was so dramatic and violent, why, Lefebvre wonders, did it not cause an “outcry”? How did it become “part and parcel of social norms”? “How many lies have their roots”<br>

  Abstract: Science and technology are integral to the definition of reality and to the restructuring of power relations and bodily experience. In
                  The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt argues that in the course of the twentieth century, political action has increasingly focused on the control of natural life and on the fabrication of automatons.¹ Thehomo fabergave way to thehomo laborans—that is, people became ever more involved in mass production and were most concerned with physiological existence. Scientific practices have been central to this transformation. Arendt argues that the experimental process that came to define the natural sciences—″the<br>

  Abstract: Few local literary cultures of premodernity anywhere permit us to follow the history and reconstruct the meanings of vernacularization with quite the same precision as is possible for Kannada, the language of what is now the southern union state of Karnataka. We can chart the shifts in cosmopolitan and vernacular cultural production without interruption from about the fifth century on, based on texts that are for the most part securely datable—an almost unparalleled antiquity and chronological transparency. Much of the data is the hard evidence of epigraphs, and their quantity is breathtaking. The region must be one of the<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I examine the creation and transformation of diasporic “Indianness” in Mauritius through alternative understandings of temporal remove and simultaneity in relation to an Indian homeland. The purpose is to interrogate temporality as a mode of building ethnic and national communities with an eye to how the category of diaspora is thus turned into a malleable entity. In this way, I seek to contextualize diasporization in Mauritius through practices that shift diasporic allegiances, preventing them from being permanently tied to a certain homeland. Language plays a central role in the production and transformation of the relations diasporic communities<br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche is fundamentally concerned with the circuitous and deceptive character of our relations to things, and with the transcendence of actuality to our representations of it at the level of the signifier. But to a semiotician, the distinction between linguistic activity and extralinguistic reality is naive, and so I turn to Umberto Eco’s more doggedly semiotic approach to this distinction in
                  A Theory of Semiotics. Eco divides semiotics into two parts: the theory of codes or signification and the theory of sign-production or language use.Codedesignates the system of rules that “generate signs as concrete occurrences in communicative intercourse.”¹<br>

  Abstract: The issue of the “amateur” or “amateurs” is more topical than ever these days, because of the easier access to equipment produced by new technologies, its miniaturization and availability, with mass industrial production making it affordable for a large majority of people. The phenomenon has been widely taken into account in the field of photography studies, where it always went hand in hand with the other – learned, expert, professional – tradition, from Foto-Auge in 1929 to the exhibition “Tous photographes” (Lausanne, 2007) or “From here on” (Arles, 2011).

  Abstract: Catholics and other Christians most likely know John Courtney Murray as a protagonist in the production of the Declaration on Religious Freedom at the Second Vatican Council, published almost forty years ago. Its significance for the public life of Catholicism in religiously pluralist societies remains hard to overestimate. Social ethics, fundamental theology, practical theology, public theology, and communications are theological specialties that also have found substance in his writings.<br>

  Book Title: Drawing New Color Lines-Transnational Asian American Graphic Narratives<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chiu Monica<br>
  Abstract: The global circulation of comics, manga, and other such visual mediums between North America and Asia produces transnational meanings no longer rooted in a separation between “Asian” and “American.” Drawing New Color Lines explores the culture, production, and history of contemporary graphic narratives that depict Asian Americans and Asians. It examines how Japanese manga and Asian popular culture have influenced Asian American comics; how these comics and Asian American graphic narratives depict the “look” of race; and how these various representations are interpreted in nations not of their production. By focusing on what graphic narratives mean for audiences in North America and those in Asia, the collection discusses how Western theories about the ways in which graphic narratives might successfully overturn derogatory caricatures are themselves based on contested assumptions; and illustrates that the so-called odorless images featured in Japanese manga might nevertheless elicit interpretations about race in transnational contexts. With contributions from experts based in North America and Asia, Drawing New Color Lines will be of interest to scholars in a variety of disciplines, including Asian American studies, cultural and literary studies, comics and visual studies.<br>

  Abstract: At the beginning of the new millennium, Soo-Young Chin, Peter X. Feng, and Josephine Lee discussed the increasing visibility of Asian American culture both inside and outside academia and consequently the growing complexity required to understand and assess Asian American cultural production. They raised key questions about what characterizes Asian American cultural production and how we understand, experience, and analyze Asian American culture (270). As Chin, Feng, and Lee have broadly defined it, the term “cultural production” refers to “processes by which certain subjects (Asian Americans and others) produce material objects, actions, and interactions; it pertains to the interpretation of<br>

  Abstract: Amid the modernization of Japan from the late nineteenth century, hero worship became an important ideological tool for molding adolescent boys into men who could serve the Japanese empire. In history, the figure of the hero is a cultural construct of idealized masculinity that arises within the context of a struggle over the gendered order. Since the meaning of gender is, as Judith Butler argues, always deferred as a kind of imitation for which there is no original, the maintenance of masculine values requires the relentless production of ideologies of gender to reinforce the subordination of women and the dominant<br>

  Author(s) LEVINSON JERROLD<br>
  Abstract: At least three different and influential theories of interpretation claim to be pragmatist. Knapp and Michaels’s theory is rigidly intentionalistic and author bound, while Richard Rorty’s contrastingly emphasizes the production of nonauthorial readings. The third, advanced by Stanley Fish, submits (and dissolves) both author and reader to the notion of the interpretive community as the authority determining the proper meaning of a text. In this essay I investigate two of these rival theories, examining them in the light of more general pragmatist principles. The purpose of this exercise is not to award a prize for the most authentically pragmatist theory<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmake~<br>

  Abstract: Throughout the history of literary and art criticism the focus has fallen, as Jean-Luc Nancy argues, on the creation or reception of works and texts. Theories of genius, authorial psychology and the material or historical conditions of production have revalued the creative processes that give rise to art in a range of different ways. Equally, important questions about reception that deal with notions of canonicity, ideology and the construction of subjectivities in texts have been generated by critical movements that seek to investigate the politics of literature, art and culture.

  Author(s): Bassett Caroline<br>
  Abstract: The Arc and the machine is a timely and original defence of narrative in an age of information. Stressing interpretation and experience alongside affect and sensation it convincingly argues that narrative is key to contemporary forms of cultural production and to the practice of contemporary life. Re-appraising the prospects for narrative in the digital age, it insists on the centrality of narrative to informational culture and provokes a critical re-appraisal of how innovations in information technology as a material cultural form can be understood and assessed. The book offers a careful exploration of narrative theory, a sophisticated critique of techno-cultural writing, and a series of tightly focused case studies. All of which point the way to a restoration of a critical - rather than celebratory approaches - to new media. The scope and range of this book is broad, its argumentation careful and exacting, and its conclusions exciting.<br>

  Book Title: Women’s writing in contemporary France-New writers, new literatures in the 1990s<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WORTON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The 1990s witnessed an explosion in women’s writing in France, with a particularly exciting new generation of writer’s coming to the fore, such as Christine Angot, Marie Darrieussecq and Regine Detambel. Other authors such as Paule Constant, Sylvie Germain, Marie Redonnet and Leila Sebbar, who had begun publishing in the 1980s, claimed their mainstream status in the 1990s with new texts. The book provides an up-to-date introduction to an analysis of new women’s writing in contemporary France, including both new writers of the 1990s and their more established counter-parts. The editors’ incisive introduction situates these authors and their texts at the centre of the current trends and issues concerning French literary production today, whilst fifteen original essays focus on individual writers. The volume includes specialist bibliographies on each writer, incorporating English translations, major interviews, and key critical studies. Quotations are given in both French and English throughout. An invaluable study resource, this book is written in a clear and accessible style and will be of interest to the general reader as well as to students of all levels, to teachers of a wide range of courses on French culture, and to specialist researchers of French and Francophone literature.<br>

  Abstract: Given the dominance of the realist tradition in Egyptian literature, it is no surprise that Cairo, whether it is the historic city or the modern metropolis, should be the main metaphor for much of the literary production during the twentieth century. Urban space, for the writers of the city, has been a major architect of its social, economic, and political fabric. At one level, the city of Cairo emerges as an actor with real agency that embodies and structures social power, as well as political, economic, and symbolic processes.

This observation makes plain the ways we may be tempted to draw a straight line from the meaning of a text to the truth of that meaning, assuming that both can be exhaustively captured and assessed on the basis of the written word alone.<br>

  Abstract: Video games (sometimes called “VDO games” in Thailand) are popular and attract massive numbers of players around the world. Thai players engage console games, computer games, online games, and handheld games, and many organizations and companies are involved in video games in Thailand, yet there are few studies on the subject. Therefore, this chapter will describe the history of video games, the current situation of video games, and explain the behavior of video game players in Thailand.

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Myth and Narrative in Contemporary Opera-Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dun Tan<br>
  Abstract: Yayoi Uno Everett focuses on four operas that helped shape the careers of the composers Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun, which represent a unique encounter of music and production through what Everett calls "multimodal narrative." Aspects of production design, the mechanics of stagecraft, and their interaction with music and sung texts contribute significantly to the semiotics of operatic storytelling. Everett's study draws on Northrop Frye's theories of myth, Lacanian psychoanalysis via Slavoj Žižek, Linda and Michael Hutcheon's notion of production, and musical semiotics found in Robert Hatten's concept of troping in order to provide original interpretive models for conceptualizing new operatic narratives.<br>

  Book Title: Mestizaje and Globalization-Transformations of Identity and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG PHILIP D.<br>
  Abstract: The Spanish word
      mestizajedoes not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.Mestizaje and Globalizationpresents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.Mestizaje and Globalizationcontributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.<br>

  Author(s): Lugo-Ocando Jairo<br>
  Abstract: Poverty, it seems, is a constant in today's news, usually the result of famine, exclusion or conflict. In Blaming the Victim, Jairo Lugo-Ocando sets out to deconstruct and reconsider the variety of ways in which the global news media misrepresent and decontextualise the causes and consequences of poverty worldwide. The result is that the fundamental determinant of poverty - inequality - is removed from their accounts. The books asks many biting questions. When - and how - does poverty become newsworthy? How does ideology come into play when determining the ways in which 'poverty' is constructed in newsrooms - and how do the resulting narratives frame the issue? And why do so many journalists and news editors tend to obscure the structural causes of poverty? In analysing the processes of news production and presentation around the world, Lugo-Ocando reveals that the news-makers' agendas are often as problematic as the geopolitics they seek to represent. This groundbreaking study reframes the ways in which we can think and write about the enduring global injustice of poverty.<br>

Hence, the moral emphasis of his criticism is striking when he attacks the praxis of exploiting poor people and their fear of Hell to the benefit of the church, the pope, and the clergy.

By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

Economic agrarian history is based epistemologically on the idea that human actions can best be understood through their economic foundations and consequences, and methodologically on the idea that the best and most accurate conclusions can be reached from a base of quantifiable and documented evidence. This strong epistemological and methodological base has resulted in a large body of excellent and rigorous work. Its focus on numbers and documents has, however, largely obscured the economic importance of cultivation carried out<br>

  Abstract: Suppose a conversation among three humanists from the recent modern past could be staged: namely, Jacques Maritain (1882–1973), a principal figure in the twentieth-century revival of Thomism and a leading Catholic philosopher; John Dewey (1859–1952), the American pragmatist and ambivalent apologist for liberalism; and Karl Marx (1818–83), founder of modern communism and the most trenchant critic of the capitalist mode of production. What might it contribute to the way we understand our contemporary situation? A successful conversation does not require complete agreement as its outcome, but it can lead to what Hans-Georg Gadamer called a “fusion of<br>

He developed his craft in what he himself later called “the primitive era of Canadian theatre.”² In the 1940s and early 1950s in Canada, opportunities for professional production of new plays were almost non-existent; the only critics available to assess and<br>

This analysis allows me to tease out the correlations that my interlocutors make between the looted objects and their own Balinese presence in contemporary Dutch society. I argue that Balinese interpretative understandings of Balinese-Dutch historical connectivities generate specific knowledge production about ‘shared cultural heritage’. The heritage I talk about here is one that differs from that of Dutch policymakers’ conception of ‘shared heritage’ but also from interpretations that might be found in an exclusively Balinese context.

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

  Abstract: Edwin Sidney Hartland (1848–1927) was a British solicitor and politician whose proficiency as a self-made folklorist and evolutionary anthropologist went far beyond dilettantism, following in the footsteps of his principal mentor, Edward B. Tylor (1832–1917). Hartland was a prominent figure in the Folklore Society, which he presided over at the turn of the century. Indeed, he was one of the members of the “Great Team” of British late Victorian folklorists, to use the expression coined by Richard Dorson (1968:202). Between 1884 and 1924 Hartland’s prolific production included his magnum opus: a three-volume work titled

  Abstract: L’écriture réflexive comme outil de professionnalisation est un objet de recherche encore peu exploré. Pourtant, au vu de la pluralisation des écrits en milieux professionnels, considérés de plus en plus comme des moyens de penser et d’agir, l’analyse des particularités de cette écriture recèle des enjeux considérables. Quelles méthodes et quels outils conceptuels utiliser pour produire des connaissances sur l’écriture professionnelle ? Rares sont les chercheurs et chercheures qui analysent leurs propres orientations méthodologiques et théoriques et mettent en évidence leurs démarches de recherche. C’est pourtant le défi qui est relevé dans cet ouvrage. Fruit d’un travail collectif, les contributions, articulées à une synthèse théorique, visent à approfondir la notion de réflexivité. Elles présentent des applications de démarches de recherche dans le champ de la formation qui se sont déroulées en Belgique, au Québec, en France et en Suisse. La diversité et la rigueur des approches qui sont exposées, à la fois sur les plans théorique et méthodologique, conduisent à une métaanalyse des conditions de production par la recherche de savoirs nouveaux sur un objet. Ces nouvelles perspectives et ces réflexions élargies susciteront l’intérêt des chercheurs et chercheures ainsi que des étudiants et étudiantes en sciences humaines et sociales, qui y trouveront matière à alimenter leurs pratiques et leurs recherches.<br>

In other words, theorization is understood as a form of neutralization of the historical context. In this, as in other pieces, Bourdieu showed reluctance to extract concepts – understood as structured structures – from the contexts of their production, or from their structuring structures (Robbins 1994).

At present, the dominant constitutive practice of contemporary social relations is the global market. Production, distribution, and consumption are constituted for the purposes either of making money or of providing “value for money”—that is, a value subject to public measurement.

By engaging with the history of the slave trade and exploring its connections with the use of African labour in contemporary modes of production in West Africa, recent art works from the region that once formed the heartland of the French slave trade can be seen to offer a discursive platform on which to foreground ‘alternative memorial practices and forms of memory-making’<br>

First, it is concerned with consumption without relating it to production, and second, the politics of consumption in the practice of political consumerism is not accompanied by a project of ethics.

  Abstract: Mainstream public memory is traditionally understood as an intentional recollection of quantifiable facts of the historical past that then constitute collective identity. Because of its suppressed nature, queer memory is flimsier: while mainstream public memory is solidly supported institutionally by politics and history, queer memory is more symbolic, derived from what is implied by exclusion rather than inclusion. By uncovering previously hidden gay and lesbian experiences, queer historians have initiated a type of cultural rebellion, juxtaposing queer memory with hetero-normative histories.

  Abstract: Metaphor and the Slave Tradeexamines the hidden though significant role the transatlantic slave trade has played in the Anglophone West African imagination and the means by which it has been metaphorized in the literary production of the region. It explores how four canonical authors in particular—Amos Tutuola, Ben Okri, Ayi Kwei Armah, and Ama Ata Aidoo—integrated metaphors of the slave trade into their fictional worlds, metaphors that were inherited from or invented as a reflection of the coded discourse surrounding the slave trade in their cultures. In much of West African fiction—even in works that employ<br>

Writing inAppleton’s Journal, George Ferris lauded the “grotesque and irresistible form” present in Twain’s work (17). B. B.

  Book Title: The Algerian New Novel-The Poetics of a Modern Nation, 1950-1979<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORLANDO VALÉRIE K.<br>
  Abstract: Disputing the claim that Algerian writing during the struggle against French colonial rule dealt almost exclusively with revolutionary themes,
         The Algerian New Novelshows how Algerian authors writing in French actively contributed to the experimental forms of the period, expressing a new age literarily as well as politically and culturally. Looking at canonical Algerian literature as part of the larger literary production in French during decolonization, Valérie K. Orlando considers how novels by Rachid Boudjedra, Mohammed Dib, Assia Djebar, Nabile Farès, Yamina Mechakra, and Kateb Yacine both influenced and were reflectors of the sociopolitical and cultural transformation that took place during this period in Algeria. Although their themes were rooted in Algeria, the avant-garde writing styles of these authors were influenced by early twentieth-century American modernists, the New Novelists of 1940s-50s France, and African American authors of the 1950s-60s. This complex mix of influences led Algerian writers to develop a unique modern literary aesthetic to express their world, a tradition of experimentation and fragmentation that still characterizes the work of contemporary Algerian francophone writers.<br>

  Abstract: With a special focus on biblical texts and images, this book nurtures new developments in biblical studies and art history during the last two or three decades. Analysis and interpretation of specific works of art introduce guidelines for students and teachers who are interested in the relation of verbal presentation to visual production. The essays provide models for research in the humanities that move beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries erected in previous centuries. In particular, the volume merges recent developments in rhetorical interpretation and cognitive studies with art historical visual exegesis. Readers will master the tools necessary for integrating multiple approaches both to biblical and artistic interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: Since its emergence in the field of art history in the 1980s, visuality – a notion that refers to the visible condition of art, to the fact that art is, partially at least, a matter of vision (in its production, exhibition, circulation, and reception) – has been key to the decentring of both the artist and the viewing subject in its relation to the image. Vision came to be systematically understood as an act conditioned by culture, social class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and geography.

  Abstract: Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production. The chapters in this collection pose questions, unsettle assumptions, and generate broad imaginative spaces for thinking about representation of pregnancy, birth, and parenting. They demonstrate the ways in which practices of consuming and using representations carry within them the productive forces of creation. Bringing together an eclectic and vibrant range of perspectives, this collection offers readers the possibility to rethink and reimagine the diverse meanings and practices of representations of these significant life events. Engaging theoretical reflection and creative image making, the contributors explore a broad range of cultural signs with a focus on challenging authoritative representations in a manner that seeks to reveal rather than conceal the insistently problematic and contestable nature of image culture.

Through research in art history, religious studies, philosophy, medical anthropology, and feminism, I first show how members of an international movement devoted to birth and art are actively using religious, secular, and re-sacralized art imagery in the visualization of labour and birth and as a ritualistic part of birth as a rite of passage.

Fiction and non-fiction stories by and about mothers—particularly the stories of poor women, working women, and women of colour—have gone largely unrecorded. What remains are patriarchal daughter-centred stories of young women who move from one male protector to another: father to husband to son. As a response to this history of literary and cultural production, the telling of mother-stories can be reclaimed as an act of resistance, whether mothers are telling their own stories, or<br>

  Book Title: The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw-Space, Materiality, Movement<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oukaderova Lida<br>
  Abstract: Following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union experienced a dramatic resurgence in cinematic production. The period of the Soviet Thaw became known for its relative political and cultural liberalization; its films, formally innovative and socially engaged, were swept to the center of international cinematic discourse. In The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw, Lida Oukaderova provides an in-depth analysis of several Soviet films made between 1958 and 1967 to argue for the centrality of space-as both filmic trope and social concern-to Thaw-era cinema. Opening with a discussion of the USSR's little-examined late-fifties embrace of panoramic cinema, the book pursues close readings of films by Mikhail Kalatozov, Georgii Danelia, Larisa Shepitko and Kira Muratova, among others. It demonstrates that these directors' works were motivated by an urge to interrogate and reanimate spatial experience, and through this project to probe critical issues of ideology, social progress, and subjectivity within post-Stalinist culture.<br>

It was also propelled by a need to redefine the role of cinema in the wake of Stalin’s death. Rethinking the language of cinema, Soviet filmmakers began to emphasize the production of the environment as a social and filmic problem, creating spatial experiences within theatrical walls that differed significantly from those of established socialist practices. These filmmakers reorganized the spaces of familiar cities, landscapes, and public and private interiors, opening them up to dialogical interactions<br>

With #GamerGate in the national news, shows like The Big Bang Theory on ever-increasing numbers of screens, and Peter Orzsag and Paul Ryan on magazine covers, it is clear that nerds, policy wonks, and neoconservatives play a major role in today's popular culture in America. The Year's Work in Nerds, Wonks, and Neocons delves into subcultures of intellectual history to explore their influence on contemporary American intellectual life. Not limiting themselves to describing how individuals are depicted, the authors consider the intellectual endeavors these depictions have come to represent, exploring many models and practices of learnedness, reflection, knowledge production, and opinion in the contemporary world. As teachers, researchers, and university scholars continue to struggle for mainstream visibility, this book illuminates the other forms of intellectual excitement that have emerged alongside them and found ways to survive and even thrive in the face of dismissal or contempt.<br>

We have already seen how “inspiration” was not necessarily an explicit reason/criterion for inclusion of works in the canon, and that, in patristic times, there was a presumption regarding the inspiration of many writings circulating in local communities. Once works achieve canonical status, it is then that the notion of inspiration emerges, later in church history, as one way of<br>

  Abstract: The traditional political communities of the central Caroline Islands, from Ulithi to Namonuito Atoll, are characteristically small. A politically autonomous community may consist of a single village, a district or a small island, each composed of matrilineal descent groups. The total population of an island or an atoll is, on average, less than 800 persons and its land area is at most five square kilometres in extent. Some scholars have suggested that institutionalized chieftainship in Micronesia, as a form of suprafamilial authority, is directly related to surplus food production (e.g. Mason 1968).

Critical interest has resulted in copious biographies and articles and the general consensus that Cervantes’s experience as captive left an indelible mark on his work.

  Author(s): Paquin Jacques<br>
  Abstract: Devant l'abondante production qui marque la poésie québécoise, acadienne et franco-ontarienne depuis 1970, de quels repères dispose-t-on pour explorer ce vaste continent?
      Nouveaux territoires de la poésie francophone au Canada 1970-2000tente de répondre à certaines interrogations : Quelle place occupent les auteurs phares? Quels sont les grands thèmes de la poésie contemporaine? Comment reconnaître les tendances les plus fortes? Quelle est la situation de l'édition? À quoi servent les anthologies? L'ouvrage jette un éclairage nouveau sur des oeuvres devenues des classiques et met en évidence l'émergence d'une nouvelle génération de poètes. Les avatars rimbaldiens, l'intimisme, le féminisme, l'urbanité et la figure de l'artiste comptent au nombre des aspects les plus frappants de ces nouveaux enjeux poétiques. Cet ouvrage met en lumière les chassés-croisés entre les constantes et les ruptures qui polarisent l'histoire de la poésie francophone contemporaine : d'Anne Hébert et Gaston Miron à Marie Uguay, en passant par Patrice Desbiens, Herménégilde Chiasson, et bien d'autres.

  Abstract: If one truth has emerged from the intense scholarly debate during the last two decades over the nature of Old Hollywood, it is that the writing of American film history must avoid the essentialist trap of considering the so-called classic text of that era as an undifferentiated flow of product whose watchwords were sameness and conformity. A correlative of this truth is that, even with its emphasis on package production (with each film in some sense a unique entity unto itself), New Hollywood filmmaking still offers regular forms of textuality that differ from those of the studio era only in<br>

As a corollary to this thesis, I would suggest that the discovery of order is to a certain extent a consequence of production and is therefore at least partly relative to human intention. An excessive insistence upon the comprehensive adequacy of this or that categorial table leads invariably to disappointment, whether through internal difficulties or the discovery of new modes of order, often<br>

  Abstract: The humanities may be defined as those disciplines primarily devoted to the study of texts. As the physical sciences concentrate on the study of natural phenomena, and the social sciences on the behavior of sentient creatures, the humanities are connected by their common interest in communicative objects, or texts. Human beings are text-producing animals, and those disciplines called “humanities” are primarily engaged in the analysis, interpretation, evaluation, and production of texts. Where there are texts, of course, there are rules governing text production and interpretation. These sets of rules or customs, with their physical or cultural constraints—variously described as<br>

  Abstract: The vocabulary and cadences of Scripture—particularly of the LXX—are imprinted deeply on Paul’s mind, and the great stories of Israel continue to serve for him as a fund of symbols and metaphors that condition his perception of the world, of God’s promised deliverance of his people, and of his own identity and calling. His faith, in short, is one whose articulation is inevitably intertextual in character, and Israel’s Scripture is the “determinate subtext that plays a constitutive role” in shaping his literary production.¹<br>

As a practice of critical thought, intellectual globalization is marked, as Anthony D.

  Abstract: For most of its post-1992 rapid industrialization, Chinese manufacturing excelled in global markets as a platform for high-volume and low-cost, export-oriented production.¹ Since China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, however, the fruits of rapid industrialization have been creating home market conditions for very different manufacturing strategies. Successful export-led industrialization has created more sophisticated domestic Chinese demand for a broad array of manufactured goods. In an effort to capture this emergent demand, Chinese producers are shifting their focus toward more advanced production and away from what was traditionally needed (or possible) within the framework of export processing relationships.<br>

Autonomy refers to the freedom of a society to make its own laws; control has to do with the expansion of rational mastery over the world of things, including the development of science and technology and their application to production and the control of nature (Castoriadis 1990: 15–17).

  Abstract: Tours et détoursexamine l'inscription du mythe de Babel dans la littérature contemporaine de langue française. Le mythe s'avère une source d'inspiration pour les auteurs examinés qui évoquent justement des phénomènes sociaux actuels, tels que le multiculturalisme, l'immigration, l'exil, la pluralité des langues, la traduction et l'identité. Les ouvrages étudiés, tous écrits en français mais issus de différents contextes linguistiques et culturels, mettent en lumière de nouvelles interprétations du mythe de Babel. Pendant longtemps le mythe de Babel et la pluralité linguistique et culturelle qui s'ensuivent ont été considérés une malédiction pour l'humanité, mais les romans à l'étude remettent en question cette vision négative. Sans exalter les bienfaits de la multiplicité, ils considèrent comment la pluralité linguistique et culturelle enrichit et façonne la production littéraire ainsi que le monde contemporain.Les auteurs et œuvres étudiés sont• Monique Bosco,Babel-Opéra• Hédi Bouraoui,Ainsi parle la tour CN• Francine Noël,Babel, prise deux ou Nous avons tous découvert l'Amérique• Ernest Pépin,Tambour-Babel• Jorge Semprun,L'Algarabie<br>

These stories explain particular histories by juxtaposing public events with private experiences, to reveal the ways families construct (or reconstruct) identity within the experience of diaspora. Giving a sense of cohesion and closure to the lives of grandparents and parents can establish a sense of authority and meaning to the writer’s own life story. Access to these stories also allows readers to understand the development of particular ethnic communities, as the narratives support the production of a history and culture<br>

  Author(s) BORGEN ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: There was an epistemic shift in the production of Japanese Buddhist texts in the early Heian period, a shift that enabled Buddhists to incorporate the elements of meditation, ritual, and religious practice in general within the science of scriptural exegesis. Until the early ninth century, the exegetic texts written by Japanese Buddhist scholars were concerned entirely with doctrinal issues. By contrast, by the mid-tenth century, the great majority of Buddhist commentarial texts had their focus on ritual practices, especially on the rituals of esoteric Buddhism, the ritual practices that became integral within the management of the Heian court and the<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: A fundamental mutation in the question of agency takes place between two movements, in a space that we can label the Enlightenment/post-Enlightenment divide. Literature is one of the cultural sites that embodies the consequences of this mutation. As Peter Bürger notes, there is a point at which the activity of the philosophes needs to slide from philosophical inquiry into aesthetic production to carry out the project of the autonomy of reason (1992, 8–11). Through this movement, aesthetics in general and the literary domain in particular become the site of absolute freedom in modern societies, that is, a site where<br>

  Abstract: The traditional categories through which early Christian exegesis is often described—“literal,” “typological,” “allegorical”—are less helpful for analyzing “ascetic exegesis” than some scholars might imagine. Contrary to my own expectation, I have discovered that typology and allegory, however much they may dominate other types of patristic interpretation, were underutilized interpretive tools in the church fathers’ production of ascetic meaning from Biblical texts. Other interpretive strategies, to be detailed in chapter 5, particularly intertextual exegesis, proved on the whole far more useful. In some cases figurative interpretation of any sort seemed unnecessary to ascetically inclined exegetes because the unadorned—but<br>

  Book Title: Kin, Gene, Community-Reproductive Technologies among Jewish Israelis<br>

  Author(s): Carmeli Yoram S.<br>
  Abstract: Israel is the only country in the world that offers free fertility treatments to nearly any woman who requires medical assistance. It also has the world's highest per capita usage of in-vitro fertilization. Examining state policies and the application of reproductive technologies among Jewish Israelis, this volume explores the role of tradition and politics in the construction of families within local Jewish populations. The contributors-anthropologists, bioethicists, jurists, physicians and biologists-highlight the complexities surrounding these treatments and show how biological relatedness is being construed as a technology of power; how genetics is woven into the production of identities; how reproductive technologies enhance the policing of boundaries. Donor insemination, IVF and surrogacy, as well as abortion, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and human embryonic stem cell research, are explored within local and global contexts to convey an informed perspective on the wider Jewish Israeli environment.<br>

  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Bouquet Mary<br>
  Abstract: The museum boom, with its accompanying objectification and politicization of culture, finds its counterpart in the growing interest by social scientists in material culture, much of which is to be found in museums. Not surprisingly, anthropologists in particular are turning their attention again to museums, after decades of neglect, during which fieldwork became the hallmark of modern anthropology - so much so that the "social" and the "material" parted company so radically as to produce a kind of knowledge gap between historical collections and the intellectuals who might have benefitted from working on these material representations of culture. Moreover it was forgotten that museums do not only present the "pastness" of things. A great deal of what goes on in contemporary museums is literally about planning the shape of the future: making culture materialize involves mixing things from the past, taking into account current visions, and knowing that the scenes constructed will shape the perspectives of future generations. However, the (re-)invention of museum anthropology presents a series of challenges for academic teaching and research, as well as for the work of cultural production in contemporary museums - issues that are explored in this volume.<br>

The contributors -- leading thinkers in science and technology studies, anthropology, and software design -- pay special attention to the specific inflections that different cultures and communities give to the value of knowledge. The richly detailed accounts presented here challenge the dominant view of knowledge as a neutral good -- information available for representation and encoding but separated from all social relations. The chapters examine specific cases in which the forms of knowledge and cross-cultural encounters are shaping technology use and development. They consider design, use, and reuse of technological tools, including databases, GPS devices, books, and computers, in locations that range from Australia and New Guinea to Germany and the United States.ContributorsPoline Bala, Alan Blackwell, Wade Chambers, Michael Christie, Hildegard Diemberger, Stephen Hugh-Jones, James Leach, Jerome Lewis, Dawn Nafus, Gregers Petersen, Marilyn Strathern, David Turnbull, Helen Verran, Laura Watts, Lee Wilson<br>

  Abstract: The use of digital technologies in the reproduction of texts has profoundly transformed attitudes toward books and also the production and format of books themselves. Remarkably, at a time when it is often suggested that digital books may soon supersede conventional books, there has been a lot of rethinking about what a book is, as both object and artifact (Boutcher 2012, 59). In addition it is often assumed that digital technologies will lead inexorably to a universalization and standardization that will override cultural differences and local identities. The way in which digital technologies are used in relation to books appears,<br>

  Reflections on the Moral Reception of Synthetic Biology from:

  Author(s) Evans John H.<br>
  Abstract: Today’s synthetic biology, just like traditional biotechnology, raises important questions about the moral significance of its products; and questions about the “use” values and disvalues of synthetic organisms are especially prominent among these. It is, after all, the uses—and, by extension, the markets—for these new bacterial organisms that typically drive research into their production. Also significant, however, are questions about the intrinsic (or inherent) value of bacteria produced through synthetic means.¹ If the public’s reaction to older forms of biotechnology is any indication, sentiments about these intrinsic values and disvalues are widespread, wielding a greatly underestimated, popular power.<br>

  Abstract: SOCIAL SCIENTISTS succeeded in laying out the variables conditioning the structure of Colombian society, focusing on land and land-tenure patterns and highlighting the concept of the agrarian frontier to underscore the chaotic nature of the social and point to the inchoate form of the political. Invoking Fabio López de la Roche’s argument that the fundamentalist Christian view serves as the umbrella or atmosphere to this historical moment provides a brief but significant comment on the cultural parameters subtending this mode-of-production model.

  Abstract: Political, economic and social barriers among Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada are giving way to global forces and the "global dreams" they inspire. This collection of original articles and essays examines popular culture, literature, theatre, belief systems, indigenous practices and questions of identity, exile and alienation. The interconnectedness and distinction of cultural production throughout the Americas, "transplanted" interests, the mediation of African and European influences, and the expression of shifting identities, all reflect the development of a new American neighbourhood.<br>

  Abstract: Merleau-Ponty’s doubts about classical Marxism were nourished by his integrity and the seriousness of his commitment to humanism. Proletarian internationalism and proletarian spontaneity had ceased to be effective factors in politics, and proletarian control of the means of production was grotesquely distorted by the Stalinist regime. Nevertheless the pressure of events compelled him, not to abandon Marx’s teaching, but to reinterpret it. Sartre was right to note that Merleau-Ponty had returned to his inner life, but his refuge was no more than a strategic retreat. In his lectures at the Collège de France he was undertaking an intellectual overhaul that<br>

  Abstract: As the digital revolution takes hold, historians have begun to reflect on the ways in which paper technologies – the codex, notebook, printed book and their indexes, annotations and tools of ordering – have come into being and contributed to the production of knowledge. Objects that were once considered evidence for historical inquiry have become their subjects.¹ The same reflexivity applies to notions of evidence, observation and objectivity, often labelled as facts and data, which have themselves been historically studied.² This chapter is about what happens when historians use digital technologies to understand paper technologies.

  Abstract: Reflections on the relationships between one period of philosophy and another raise important methodological issues which first emerge in their modern form in the wake of Kant, Herder and other thinkers in the second half of the eighteenth century. This is the period in which the ramifications of the idea that philosophy is bound up with the historical circumstances of its production begin to be apparent. In the light of these ramifications, the apparently obvious aim of identifying anticipations or echoes of twentieth-century forms of philosophy in the nineteenth century is by no means as straightforward as it might at<br>

  Abstract: Memory has enjoyed a well charted resurgence in the postwar period in cultural production, social life and academic study (see Huyssen 2000; Misztal 2003; Radstone 2000). The social dislocations that occurred in the aftermath of the world wars, and the radical trauma of the Holocaust, threw into sharp relief issues of remembrance and commemoration (Wolf 2004; Margalit 20002). In more recent years, a growing disillusionment with the rhetoric of progress which has been so central to modernity has required a reconsideration of pasts that had been hurriedly discarded.

  Abstract: A kind of ‘thingly’ contamination of the present was brought about through the division of labour, the industrialisation of production, the processing of information, the specialisation of the knowledge of things, and above all the desubstantialisation of these things. In Western philosophical traditions, things were often ordered according to essences, substrata, qualities, predicates,

  Book Title: Post-beur Cinema-North African Émigré and Maghrebi-French Filmmaking in France since 2000<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Higbee Will<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1980s and the arrival of Beur cinema filmmakers of Maghrebi origin have made a key contribution French cinema's representation of issues such as immigration, integration and national identity. However, they have done so mostly from a position on the margins of the industry. In contrast, since the early 2000s, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers have occupied an increasingly prominent position on both sides of the camera, announcing their presence on French screens in a wider range of genres and styles than ever before. This greater visibility and move to the mainstream has not, however, automatically meant that these films have lost any of the social or political relevance. Indeed in the 2000s many of these films have increasingly questioned the boundaries between national, transnational and diasporic cinema, whilst simultaneously demanding, either implicitly or explicitly, a reconsideration of the very difference that has traditionally been seen as a barrier to the successful integration of North African immigrants and their descendants into French society. Through a detailed study of this transformative decade for Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France, this book argues for the emergence of a 'Post-Beur' cinema in the 2000s that is simultaneously global and local in its outlook. Its key features include: A comprehensive overview of the key developments in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France since the 2000s: counter-heritage cinema and the memorialisation of France’s colonial past; journey narratives and the myth of return; the ‘mainstreaming’ of Maghrebi-French directors and stars; representations of Islam. Detailed case studies of key films from the 2000s that have yet to receive scholarly attention, such as Hors-la-loi, Dernier maquis and Vénus noire.

The films have often been treated by academics and critics as a kind of socio-cultural document, rather than an entertainment ‘product’ aimed at mass audiences: a cinema more of interest to sociologists, journalists and academics as a reflection of contemporary socio-political realities facing<br>

  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

  Abstract: Theatrical performances consist of events arranged in a sequence. The sequence of events in which a given production of a play is performed need not always be the same from performance to performance.

  Abstract: The application of neuroscience to fields beyond medicine¹ has been characterized as revolutionary, akin to the industrial and information revolutions (Lynch 2009, 10) and evidence of the birth of a “neurosociety” in which all domains of life and knowledge production are (or soon will be) under the sign of the “neuro.” Each day, it seems, the popular press reports new neuroscientific findings with breathless wonder. Recent headlines have claimed that neuroscience has the power to read our minds (Sample 2007), erase our memories (Carey 2009), predict our propensity for violence (Harrell 2010), and alter the neural fabric of our identities.<br>

  Abstract: In 1897, toward the end of the period covered in this book, a new genre emerged alongside the constellation of visual and literary arts dedicated to a realist Christ image: the Jesus movie. There are many ways in which the early history of the Jesus movie echoes that of the Jesus novel more than a half century earlier, from the new genre’s immediate international scope to the hesitant, incremental advance of its pictorial resources. Over the years of 1897 and 1898 alone, French and American production companies, each working in relative isolation, made about half a dozen known Jesus movies,<br>

  Abstract: According to John Camp, walls are the “most enduring evidence of antiquity surviving in the landscape today.”² As features in the built environment, the remains of walls delimit the lives of ancient humans in both time and space; they give substance to the past. Perhaps it is not surprising that the prominence of walls as archaeological features is shared by their prominence as narrative plot devices. They stand out (as it were) in both contexts. It might even be said that walls occupy a unique position as both signifiers of cultural production and structures within narrative. Between their existence as<br>

  Abstract: Television archives play a vital role in the day-to-day business of the television industry. They help television makers identify footage and ideas for the programs of tomorrow. Consequently, the archives are organized to support the production process, and any other function is secondary to that objective. At the same time, by default not design, television archives contain the cultural legacy of the twentieth century and play a key role in the infrastructure of modern memory. On the one hand, they house the blockbuster television events and hit series that are recycled so frequently that they seem to be permanently established<br>

This theory runs through a vast panorama of universal history, which is painted in the book’s central chapter in a quaintly archaic style that could make the anthropological reader wince.

The meeting place is neither people nor place; it is some kind of algorithm of sociability, which from a material thinking point of view must be manifest in some palpable expression, whether fleeting glance, parallax of legs, or other unforeseen juxtaposition of formerly strange things. The meeting place is a matrix for the production of metaphors, figures of transport joining unlike things.

  Book Title: Heidegger and Criticism-Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Pease Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: In Heidegger and Criticism: Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction, William Spanos examines the controversy, both in Europe and the United States, surrounding Heidegger and recent disclosures about his Nazi past. Not intended as a defense or apology for Heidegger’s thought, Spanos instead affirms the importance of Heidegger’s “antihumanist” interrogation of the modern age, its globalization of technology, and its neo-imperialist politics. The attack on Heidegger’s “antihumanist” discourse (by “liberal humanists” who have imported the European debated into the United States) aligns ideologically with the ongoing policing operations of William Bennett, Allan Bloom, E.D. Hirsch, Roger Kimball, Dinesh D”Souza, and others in the spheres of higher education and cultural production. Throughout his arguments, Spanos focuses not so much on Heidegger the historical subject as on the transformative cultural political discourses and practices, implicit in and enabled by Heidegger’s interrogations of Being and Time, that have led to the contemporary emergence of the multiplicity of resistant “Others” colonized by hegemonic discursive formations, all the while reminding us that Heidegger’s philosophic interrogations eventually generate a diverse body of transgressive writing and an oppositional intellectual climate in the West.<br>

  Book Title: Narratives of Agency-Self-Making in China, India, and Japan<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Dissanayake Wimal<br>
  Abstract: This multidisciplinary collection underlines the importance of understanding the operations of human agency-defined here as the ability to exert power, specifically in resistance to ideological pressure. In particular, the contributors emphasize the historical and cultural conditions that facilitate the production of agency in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures of China, India, and Japan. In Narratives of Agency, scholars from a variety of disciplines argue that traditional Western approaches to the study of these cultures have unduly focused on the pervasive influence of family and clan (China), caste and fatalism (India), and groupism (Japan). This tendency has been exacerbated by modern critical approaches, such as postmodernism and poststructuralism, that not only are increasingly popular in studying these cultures but also de-emphasize the role of the individual. The resultant undermining of the notion of human agency tends to give short shrift to the very real individual differences between groups and ignores questions of personal desire and intentionality. These essays remind us that members of a community have to make personal choices, struggle and interact with others, argue about positions, and confront new challenges, all of which involve intentionality and human agency. A new look at a topic central to cross-cultural understanding, Narratives of Agency will be essential reading for those interested in China, India, Japan, and the world beyond._x000B_ _x000B_Contributors: Richard G.

The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

  Abstract: In the thirteenth century, western Europe witnessed a sharp increase in vernacular literacy and the widespread appearance, for the first time since classical antiquity, of a large body of secular literature for popular consumption.¹ Some of the earliest surviving manuscripts of vernacular poetry are multiauthored, scribally compiled anthologies of troubadour lyric, composed in Old Occitan (also known as Old Provençal) and assembled around the middle of the century. Although the period of troubadour lyric production spans both the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, transmission had been predominantly oral—the texts were sung—and only the poets from the end of the<br>

Few on the left initially believed that the Enlightenment was the source of the problem and even fewer believed that “mass education” is the equivalent of “mass deception.” But the interwar period saw the individual subordinated to the collective, public opinion shaped by propaganda, responsibility identified with obeying orders, tastes structured by the media, sacrifice for the masses perceived as a<br>

  Abstract: Habermas first developed a positive conception of legitimacy at the beginning of the 1970s, when he took up Max Weber’s sociology of government (
                     Herrschaftssoziologie) and the Marxist critique of capitalism (Legitimation;Rekonstruktion). Legitimacy, as he has defined it, means the “worthiness of recognition [Anerkennungswürdigkeit] of a political order” (Rekonstruktion, 271).Legitimation Crisis, which dates from this period, focuses on the production of meaning (and crises of meaning) within the capitalist system—when the administration can shoulder economic problems but can no longer account for its operations (Legitimation, 98).<br>

  Book Title: Outlaw Rhetoric-Figuring Vernacular Eloquence in Shakespeare's England<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mann Jenny C.<br>
  Abstract: Outlaw Rhetoricexamines the substantial and largely unexplored archive of vernacular rhetorical guides produced in England between 1500 and 1700. Writers of these guides drew on classical training as they translated Greek and Latin figures of speech into an everyday English that could serve the ends of literary and national invention. In the process, however, they confronted aspects of rhetoric that run counter to its civilizing impulse. For instance, Mann finds repeated references to Robin Hood, indicating an ongoing concern that vernacular rhetoric is "outlaw" to the classical tradition because it is common, popular, and ephemeral. As this book shows, however, such allusions hint at a growing acceptance of the nonclassical along with a new esteem for literary production that can be identified as native to England. Working across a range of genres, Mann demonstrates the effects of this tension between classical rhetoric and English outlawry in works by Spenser, Shakespeare, Sidney, Jonson, and Cavendish. In so doing she reveals the political stakes of the vernacular rhetorical project in the age of Shakespeare.<br>

  Abstract: The dynamic fields of the history of the book and the sociology of the text are the areas this volume investigates, bringing together ten specially commissioned essays that between them demonstrate a range of critical and material approaches to medieval, early modern, and digital books and texts. They scrutinize individual medieval manuscripts to illustrate how careful re-reading of evidence permits a more nuanced apprehension of production, and reception across time; analyse metaphor for our understanding of the Byzantine book; examine the materiality of textuality from Beowulf to Pepys and the digital work in the twenty-first century; place manuscripts back into specific historical context; and re-appraise scholarly interpretation of significant periods of manuscript and print production in the later medieval and early modern periods. All of these essays call for a new assessment of the ways in which we read books and texts, making a major contribution to book history, and illustrating how detailed focus on individual cases can yield important new findings.

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century. LUCIA BINOTTI is an associate professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br>

These two fifteenth-century books have many similarities.

  Abstract: Since the mid-2000s there has been a marked uptick across the Western world of discussions surrounding the validity and effectiveness of feminism today.¹ Terms such as “postfeminism” or “lifestyle feminism” are increasingly used to characterize a popular interest in making feminism palatable through depoliticization, even as political actions are publicly evaluated as successes or failures on the basis of criteria more appropriate for their second-wave forebears. These discussions either brand feminist cultural production as successful activism against a sexist, mainstream, and consumerist culture, or condemn it as mere media sensation that points to the failure or ineffectuality of feminism today.<br>

  Abstract: Bicycle messengers provide a valuable on-demand service to urban businesses that require same-day delivery of time-sensitive material. This chapter analyzes the spatial and organizational contradictions that enable and disrupt the urban bicycle messenger industry’s production of speed. It begins with the industry’s general context, describing the congestion that makes the “low-tech” bicycle the city’s fastest mode of delivery. It then moves to explore two sides of the messenger’s labor situation, the stress that arises conjointly out of that enabling congestion and the industry’s demands for speed, and the stress-mitigating enjoyment that arises out of those aspects of the labor similar<br>

  Abstract: One linchpin that holds together Western modernity, the secularization thesis, is crucial in narrating the historical progress of society away from religious control to individual determination. The thesis can be seen as comprising six components: 1) the creation of different institutional apparati that separate religion from politics, 2) the depoliticization and privatization of religion, 3) the decline in religious belief, 4) the development of cultural identity, 5) the rise of the state as governmental form, and 6) the production of capitalist markets.¹ Together these components describe the new phenomenon that constitutes modernity as different from religious and traditional cultures.

Abstract: “Empowering” Airdalers, in other words, was a long‐term project of patiently coaxing people into public life, into responsible citizenship, and not simply an invitation to “do your own thing.” The group agreed that it was good for Airdalers to speak out on the issues, regardless of their opinions; that is why they opened their monthly meetings to everyone—even to Microtech employees. At these meetings, the group made decisions about the campaigns and lawsuits and got updates on environmental problems at Microtech. Still, the group made time for members to explore their own opinions. They would erupt into spontaneous discussions about the morality of risk taking at the Microtech plant, for instance, or the politics of military production. At one meeting, group members began venturing their opinions about the Cold War and its impact on American democracy. The ACES leader said these exchanges ought to happen more often because “that’s what ACES exists for—to empower people.” In short, this group understood public‐spirited citizenship in the language of expressive individualism. Their use of this language differed from what previous research would have guessed. How can an observer understand the difference?<br>

Abstract: Linguistic anthropology is not a unified field, but it does have some commonly held theoretical views and practices. Many have been consistent over time. Two obvious ones are the importance of learning a field language and the importance of collecting language data, understood broadly as anything from eliciting text to recording naturally occurring speech, for a variety of research aims. As for a general model of language as culture, there is a clear shared sense that language is structured and structuringthat it is a cultural practice both deriving from and helping to constitute society and culture. Linguistic phenomena have unconscious character (as Boas argued) as well as regularities of communicative practice and certain persistent features of reference (Sapir
         1949:104) that function in the production of shared meaning or some approximation of it. Well before the linguistic anthropologists of Durantis third paradigm started thinking about practice theory and performativity, Sapir articulated this view: While we often speak of society as though it were a static structure defined by tradition it is only apparently a static sum of social institutions; actually it is being reanimated or creatively reaffirmed from day to day by particular acts of a communicative nature which obtain among the individuals participating in it.b[1931]<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Although an influential figure within German social theory for decades, Luhmann has never been an especially popular figure in American circles, perhaps because his theory is in actuality what many sociologists have accused Parson’s of being: a theory reducing social actors to nothing more than epiphenomena of their social system. Hence, Luhmann’s book consists of his application of concepts such as system/environment, medium/form, first‐ and second‐order observation, self‐reference and external reference and above all the distinction between psychic systems (systems of consciousness) and social systems (systems of communication) to the realm of art, thereby conceptually transforming it into the “art system.” One of the ironies in Luhmann’s analysis is that his claim for the “autonomy of art” is seemingly refuted by his own, wholly social, assessment of it. Indeed, reading Luhmann’s book is a little like watching Frankenstein at work: his conceptual apparatus renders the ostensibly organic associations we might have of art as being instead mechanical and clinical. For all of Parsons’s own romance with systems theory and cybernetics, his central concern was always with the cultural product of those systems, which he referred to variously as “instrumental activism” and “institutionalized individualism,” that is, the way in which differentiation led to the production of a more complex and sophisticated individualism within the societal community. This constituted Parsons’s standard for the evolution of societies. Luhmann, meanwhile, consistently held that social systems operate “behind the backs” of actors, operating to reduce complexity for such actors, on the one hand, while furthering systems imperatives, on the other. This contrast between mentor and student becomes most obvious in their respective views of culture: while Parsons never fully unpacked the concept of culture in his own work, his emphasis on values and norms opened the door to what today is known as t~<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: As a number of important recent studies have shown, by the 1730s the church of England had emerged from a series of crises as a powerful and hegemonic institution, both locally and nationally.
      6Reaffirmation of the continuing legitimacy of an incipient Dissenting tradition in the face of a resurgent church was thus urgent. To be a Dissenter in eighteenth‐century England was to challenge the legitimacy of the current regime within both church and state. It was, then, an active and oppositional commitment—one in which remembering, renewing, and reinforcing an identity with the actions and principles of their forebears played a significant part. The future of Dissent, in other words, required a continuing commitment to the past and the production of meaningful connections with Dissenters of previous generations stretching back beyond living memory. Whether Presbyterian city merchant, Independent shopkeeper, or Baptist village blacksmith, their common status as the heirs of the persecuted victims of the Stuarts, and their High Church Tory allies, provided not merely a negative or passive common identity but an active and politically resistant one. Dissent was, in other words, an identity rooted in a narrative history. One of the ways of exploring this narrative identity is precisely through the Dissenters’ construction and reconstruction of their own history—and memory—in eighteenth‐century England. Here I want to focus on the writing of the two most important Dissenting historians of this period: Edmund Calamy and Daniel Neal.7<br>

Abstract: With the emergence of information genres, technicity becomes fraught with social consequence. As I have noted, information genres are essentially empty forms with no specified knowledge content; they are conduits for the language of any science or profession and answerable less to those disciplines than to bureaucratic agendas. With the rise of these genres, technical language is no longer confined to sites of knowledge production but is disseminated; and the further it ranges, the less precise such language becomes. With the penetration of technical language into the general field of discourse, technicity competes with clarity as a rival norm. Language that does not replicate the sound of technicity fails to sound authoritative. This is surely one source of the verbosity that so troubles modern writing. This effect is further intensified by the emergence of a technical language of administration. If professions and sciences were bureaucratized in modernity, management conversely was scientized. The language of management mimics and intensifies even as it disseminates the technicity of the sciences and professions.

Abstract: The apologetic project can be compared to rites of institution in that it establishes a social difference—one that becomes part of a group’s self‐understanding—by calling attention to a difference in a preexisting state of affairs.
         61Apologetic theology exploits objective differences between religious traditions in order to establish a community’s sense of its uniqueness. The “demythologization” of apologetics reveals a gap between the social differences constitutive of a community’s sense of identity and the objective differences upon which these are founded. Now, an underlying intent to express communal loyalty takes the form of an oppositional stance in a situation of theological challenge. This oppositional attitude then determines which differences will be incorporated into the group’s self‐understanding. An obliteration of the distinction between social and objective difference, however, creates the illusion that the oppositional attitude plays no active role in the production of communal identity, that it merely follows an awareness of objective difference as an inevitable consequence. One of the dangers of traditional apologetics, then, is for a simple awareness of objective differences between religions to compel an oppositional stance, even when the identity of the home tradition is not threatened. A confusion of social for objective difference allows the directionality from attitude to observation to reverse itself such that the simple awareness of differences between communities evokes an oppositional attitude. By dispelling the illusion that makes opposition an automatic reaction to objective difference, comparative theology frees itself of the false obligation to assume an oppositional stance toward other traditions.<br>

Abstract: A text transcends its own production; specifically, it transcends the psychological and sociological conditions of its own production. Ricoeur shows how this semantic autonomy is threefold in nature [
         21]. First, there is autonomy from the intentions of the author; in other words, what the text signifies is no longer what the author intended. We could say that the author has limited control over the meaning that the reader appropriates. Second, a text becomes autonomous with respect to the cultural situation and the social conditions that pertained at the time of production. Third, the audience for whom the text was written is transient; unlike dialogue, the original addressee is no longer present. Ricoeur argues that “the work itself creates an audience, which potentially includes anyone who can read” [41, p. 298], and he suggests that a text is open to an unlimited series of readings.<br>

Abstract: In
         Bodies That Matter(1993), a book that begins, significantly, with an epigraph from Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1991), Butler begins to ponder the problems of the analogical model, although race is arguably still added to arguments about gender and sexuality. The bulk of the introduction theorizes the constructedness of “sex” and interrogates the critical assumption of a prior, unmarked category of sex onto which gender is culturally imposed. Instead of constructedness, Butler proposes the notion of matter, a process that “produce[s]the effect of boundary, fixity, and surface we call matter” (1993, 9). Sex and the contours of the body, Butler argues, are regulated by the heterosexual imperative. It is only much later in the introduction, after the theorizations of the body, sex, and matter have been made, that Butler introduces, as part of her chapter summaries, the idea that “normative heterosexuality is clearly not the only regulatory regime in the production of bodily contours” (1993, 17). Structurally, that is, body, sex, and matter are constituted as the main items of theory to which race is added. As Butler argues, race is not simply another domain separable from sexual difference, “but … its ‘addition’ subverts the monolithic workings of the heterosexual imperative as I have described it so far” (18). Although Butler is clearly aware of the problems of simply adding race to the understandings of the body and of sex, her own positioning of race in the introduction is nonetheless additive. Yet Butler goes on to suggest a focus on the specificities as well as intersections of race and gender construction: “It seems crucial to resist the model of power that would set up racism and homophobia and misogyny as parallel or analogical relations. The assertion of their abstract or structural equivalence not only misses the specific history of their construction and elaboration, but also delays the important work of thinking through the ways in which thes~<br>

Abstract: See Homi K. Bhabha,
            Location of Culture(London and New York: Routledge, 1994). Following in Fanon’s footsteps, he provides a pertinent analysis of how the identity‐shaping recognitive process within the concrete historical conditions of colonialism and its postcolonial aftermath has worked to suppress the play of difference within each cultural identity. Part of the strategy of colonial rule and ideological justification for the European colonizers, he points out, was always to construct rules and standards of recognition around the notions of “modernity,” “rationality,” and “progress” and to produce a totalizing and hierarchically structured binary opposition between the colonizers and the colonized by recognizing the full presence of modernity and rationality in the former while assigning to the latter their complete absence or merely partial presence. The colonizing Europe accomplished this by disavowing the presence of heterogeneity within itself, such as the feminine and the irrational, and symbolically constructing and representing the colonized cultures as the essentialized Other of its now homogeneous rational self (and civilized, muscular Christianity)—e.g., the bestially sexual Africans, the duplicitous Chinese, and the effeminate and degenerate Hindus. But the artificial construction of such a binary opposition is inherently unstable, Bhabha argues, as can be seen for instance from the self‐contradictory nature of the colonizers’ attempt to convert the subject population to Christianity and to create a class of colonial elites educated in the ways of Europe, which was tantamount to an implicit recognition of the capacity of the colonized for rationality and self‐government, while at the same time deprecating and deriding that recognized presence of the “civilized” qualities in them as mere mimicry or even mockery of the authentic European, Christian identity. According to Bhabha, it is precisely the practice of mimicry on the part of the colon~<br>

Abstract: Tesauro explains the formation of a “concept” at the beginning of his vast
      The Aristotelian Telescope(Il Cannocchiale aristotelico, first ed. 1654), the most important seventeenth‐century analysis of metaphorical expression: “The human intellect, like a pure mirror that is always the same and always different, expresses in itself the images of the objects that present themselves before it [the intellect]. These are what we call thoughts. As our mental discourse is nothing but an ordered context of these inner images, so is the external discourse nothing but an order of sensiblesigns, which are copied from the mental images, like types from their archetypes. But among these external signs, some are eloquent, others are silent, and others composed of silent eloquence and eloquent silence.”4Although he clearly echoes Aristotle’sDe anima3.4, Tesauro underscores that the intellect “expresses” the images it receives from the external world. Moreover, he identifies these external images with thoughts. An additional, essential detail to consider is Tesauro’s definition of human intellect as “mirror” (specchio), a concept that will play a fundamental role in our analysis of his texts on the shroud. Tesauro’s “mirror” elucidates and expands Aristotle’s concept of “writing table” (De anima430a1). Tesauro’s “always the same and always different” mirror highlights the mutual relationship between internal and external visibility. For Tesauro, to think means to reflect the infinite multiplicity of the real through an unrelenting production of visual metaphors, verbal and visible alike. For metaphors, Tesauro explicitly states in hisAristotelian Telescope, are “the most eloquent and fertile childbirth [parto] of human intellect.”5<br>

Abstract: This study examines the production of religious collective memory at a fundamentalist Christian school. By depicting in rich detail what happened on September 11, 2001, in one eighth‐grade classroom and how the events of that day were discussed in the weeks that followed, the article reveals the processes wherein the attacks were subsumed into an overarching narrative attesting to God’s control over history. After analyzing the implications of the resultant narrative, the article speculates that the categories of theological certainty and humanistic questioning currently define a breach within the American populace that is playing out not only in politics but in education, bearing important consequences for the purposes of schooling writ large and for religious and public schools as institutions.<br>

Abstract: Unfried's article itself can be approached in different ways. One can see it as a case of speculative interpretation, based not on first‐hand research but on a priori models. This is, of course, a more charitable way of saying that it is a case of sloppy research, given the fact that by the time he was writing his article there had already been numerous Bulgarian publications on the novel cultural treatment of former monuments, the mausoleum included.
         56But one can also treat it as a case of scholarly balkanism: the notion that explanatory approaches to phenomena in southeastern Europe often rest upon a discourse (in the Foucauldian sense)—or upon what might be called a stable system of stereotypes by those who shun the notion of “discourse”—that places the Balkans in a cognitive straitjacket. InImagining the Balkans,I refrained from generalizing about scholarly output, maintaining that the scholarly project moves along different lines than does the production of popular mythology and only occasionally intersects with it. My caveat was: “This is not to say that a great number of the scholarly practitioners of Balkan studies in the West do not share privately a staggering number of prejudices; what it says is that, as a whole, the rules of scholarly discourse restrict the open articulation of these prejudices.”57I still believe this to be true, and if I have erred, it is only in the direction of too much leniency.<br>

Abstract: Human community under such fragile circumstances constantly devolves into a community of mere difference alone. The original sin, from a poetic point of view, is the failure to embrace our own deeper capabilities for creating ever more inclusive social worlds. The possibility for a living creative tension among others is on some level always already defeated by the use of human creative faculties in merely limited ways, by historical stasis and consolidations of power, and by all too human anxieties that leave us naked and ashamed before one another. In symbolic terms, the invisible “fruitfulness” of social generativity in the image of a Creator is inevitably (if understandably) overcome by the idolatrous temptation of the visible “fruit” of a fixed and tangible “knowledge of good and evil.” The products of creative life are mistaken for creative life itself. Moral uncreativity is perhaps similar in this respect to bad literature: repetitive of worn‐out clichés (as also in Hannah Arendt’s description of the overwhelming reliance on clichés by Adolf Eichmann), lacking a more inclusive movement and tension, or uninvested with openness to larger and wider meaning.
         35In any case, the challenge for us morally creative beings is to turn tensions of fear and division in human relations into tensions of inclusive production and multiplication. It is to imitate the Creator’s perfect Sabbath, which is no mere final stasis but a living harmony of the ongoing differences between night and day, land and water, plants and animals, and the whole Creation in all its marvelous and interacting diversity. The expulsion from the Garden of Eden is a loss, from this perspective, not of placid amoral inactivity but of the vital capability for generating, on the basis of human multiplicity and otherness, an ever more complex and diverse narrative of humankind.<br>

Abstract: The framework for a practical and normative ethics entails not just our professional ethos and action but also the externalities spoken of earlier. For instance, the report of the American Library Association’s (ALA) Core Values Task Force II explicitly acknowledges the values‐based nature of the mission statement. The values that are identified in the report are “Access; Confidentiality/Privacy; Democracy; Diversity; Education and Lifelong Learning; Intellectual Freedom; Preservation; The Public Good; Professionalism; Service; Social Responsibility” [
         14]. If we take these goals to be genuine expressions of the professional ethos, then the reality of external forces—politics, economics, information production, and the public good—must be considered. If there are conflicts and contests among these forces, we as professionals have to address them. Suppose the decision is to trust the market to create and/or make available that which is best (in every sense of the word) for people. One outcome may be, as Pierre Bourdieu observes, “that everything the new technology and economically integrated communications groups put into circulation—that is to say, televised messages as well as books, films, or games, all generally subsumed under the term of ‘information’—be conceived as a mere commodity, and consequently treated as any other product and subjected to the law of profit” [15, p. 68]. Given the empirical reality of market consolidation of mass media companies [16], practical and normative ethical action calls for a skepticism regarding market‐based claims. The concentration on efficiency that market economics dictates can, in fact, be antithetical to stated professional goals. “Indeed, if economic efficiency (in the sense of Pareto optimality) were the only criterion for economic judgement, and if the various conditions (such as no externality) imposed by the so‐called ‘Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics’ were to hold, then there would be in general no w~<br>

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Abstract: For another explanation of Smith’s approach to the Bible, see Barlow,
            Mormons and the Bible, 57–61; my emphasis, however, is on the extent to which Smith felt bound by the text, even as he changed it (see ibid., 61). Moreover, Barlow explains Smith’s approach to the text largely in terms of contemporary practices that did not distinguish authors from editors, arguing that Smith used these conventions “creatively” and consistent with “prophetic writers of ancient times.” My differences with this argument are slight and result primarily from my emphasis on those sections of the JST that are not merely editorial, but radical reformulations of the biblical narrative. I believe these additions are too extensive to be rationalized by nineteenth‐century editorial conventions, especially given the Bible’s near‐fetishistic canonical status during this period. Finally, though I, too, consider ancient “bible writers” to be a useful analogy to Smith’s production of new text, I do not ground the analogy in Smith’s felt sense of “godly authority or insight” or “concern … with enlightening the world through revealed truth” (ibid., 60–61). These are the elements of Smith’s own story which I argue are not necessary to and can obscure the nature and effect of his reformulation of the biblical narrative.<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: While respecting the tradition’s insistence that brahman is more than the object of what Foucault would call a “discursive formation,” Clooney argues that the knowledge of brahman is thoroughly “inscribed” in the Advaita “Text”; that is to say, such knowledge becomes available only in and through a sustained engagement with the foundational texts of the Advaita tradition. See Clooney,
            Theology after Vedānta, 33: “Though Brahman is neither a fiction (as might be a character in a novel) nor a textual production (as might be a ritual vis‐à‐vis the texts which accompany it), Advaita’s truth about Brahman does not exist outside of texts, but only after them.” See also “Principle of Upasaṃhāra,” 284, 294 n. 12, where Clooney draws an intriguing parallel between the Vedānta concept of brahman and the Mīmāṃsā principle ofartha.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: The profound change that has taken place in our relation to the past also has far‐reaching consequences for the way we envision the future: “In effect, it was the way in which a society, nation, group or family envisaged its future that traditionally determined what it needed to remember of the past to prepare that future; and this in turn gave meaning to the present, which was merely a link between the two” (Nora
      2002).3As I wish to argue here, the fact that the past has become so much a part of the present may well explain why re‐vision no longer serves to envision new futures. InThe Production of Presence(2004), the German new philologist Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht characterizes contemporary historical culture as a “broad present” (121) that leaves the future for all practical purposes “inaccessible” (120), outside the reach of our collective imagination. As the question in the title of this article indicates, my concern is with re‐vision as something we seem to have lost: “whatever happened to re‐vision” expresses my surprise and confusion as I discover that something has gone missing. As I will argue, what seems to have disappeared is a clear sense of where we want to be in the future, the sense of rewriting or revisiting the past in order to change the future. More than anything, perhaps, it is the future as a collective project that seems to be forgotten, relegating visions of a better world or a just society to the discourses of a particular (nineteenth‐century) ideological formation, a “chapter in cultural history,” as Rich already suspected.4It is this sense of futures past that concerns me here, and I hear it resounding in Huyssen’s phrase used as an epigraph above. For, as he does, I believe “it is time to remember the future, rather than simply to worry about the future of memory” (Huyssen2003, 29).<br>

Abstract: It is important to clarify at this point that the historicism we espouse is strictly a methodology to preserve the historical record. As stated above, the historicism we are advocating is founded upon the works of Johann Gottfried von Herder. We see in his reflections on mankind’s intellectual development a way to avoid the question of objective truth in librarianship for the sake of historical comprehension. It is very similar to Descartes suspending the truth value of the propositions of his beliefs in order to arrive at epistemological certainty. Our suspension of truth value does not arrive at epistemological certainty about the propositions contained in the many volumes housed in a library but rather at certainty that the historical record has not been compromised by the elimination of any these volumes. In other words, librarians must suspend the truth value of singular items and artifacts in the historical record in order that the whole truth of any given period of history be accurately analyzed and understood. As Herder states: “If history in its simplest sense were nothing but a description of an occurrence, of a production, then the first requirement is that the description be
         whole, exhaust the subject, show it to use from all sides” [74].<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: These methodological oversights are surprising since Eades is clearly familiar with research exploring the links between history, memory, and collective representations. She cites Jacques Le Goff, Marc Ferro, Pierre Nora, Michel de Certeau, Paul Ricoeur, and Henry Rousso alongside a wide range of colonial/postcolonial historians and theorists, including Robert Stam, Benjamin Stora, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dominick LaCapra. In the end, theory and formal analysis drown out contextual issues of production, distribution, and reception. Three of the book's four chapters deal primarily with theme and form; only the first examines historiographic issues in their own right. This imbalance is not necessarily a flaw, but it does illustrate the challenges of interdisciplinary research and writing. Many film scholars will welcome the author's extraordinarily detailed inventory of the strategies used in postcolonial cinema to critique imperialism, particularly the creative subversion (and to a lesser extent, perpetuation) of representational conventions inherited from colonial‐era painting, literature, and movies. On the other hand, cultural historians will likely be disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the life of these films in society, the multiple meanings attached to them by viewers, and their relation to competing discourses of the same era.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: Traditional film studies starts with the individual work, genre, or director, and moves outward to larger issues of the ideologies of production and reception, to gender issues, to the effects of distribution on viewership, and increasingly to the ways globalization is affecting national cinemas, always attempting to solidify its ground in theory. Media studies starts with larger textual entities, sometimes isolating a media artifact—a genre of music, a television series, a social‐networking site, a computer game—often analyzing these from the perspective of subcultural, audience‐specific interaction. Perhaps film studies has never quite removed itself from the aura of art, and perhaps media studies still retains roots in methodologies of sociology and cultural history.

Abstract: Reflections on the Justis a collection of essays addressing the idea of justice as a moral and a practical issue. This review will deal less with the individual essays than with the structure of the volume and the place the work occupies in the larger context of Paul Ricoeur’s thought. Ricoeur’s philosophical oeuvre spans more than fifty years and is vast, both in terms of scope and volume. He is likely to be remembered for two principal works, however: the three volumes ofTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–88), in which he lays out what has become the decisive formulation of the idea of narrative identity, andOneself as Another(Chicago, 1992), the title under which his Gifford Lectures were published. In the latter volume, Ricoeur focuses the idea of narrative identity on questions of moral theory. It is fair to say that Ricoeur’s philosophical production after this point functions less as stand‐alone projects than as clarification and extension of issues raised inOneself as Another.<br>

Abstract: Blumenberg's stance toward traditional narratives of secularization followed closely from his fundamental arguments. Against the claims of Karl Löwith, Leo Strauss, and other commentators, Blumenberg insisted that continuities between theological and political concepts indicate “a mortgage of prescribed questions,” the “answer positions” to which have been filled with an unrelated content that performs a function similar to its theological predecessor. If modernity is characterized by self-assertion, then one cannot understand it merely as “a copy of an original truth that is identified with God.” Rather, Blumenberg maintained, the modern age is truly original, according to the “axiom that the legitimate ownership of ideas can be derived only from their authentic production.”

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Blanchot's response to the inadequacy he recognizes in Lévinas's philosophy is to rewrite it through the production of commentary. In the prefatory note to
         The Infinite ConversationBlanchot suggests that the volume should itself be understood as participating in thedésoeuvrementthat characterizes writing. This is a writing that “is called upon to undo the discourse in which, however unhappy we believe ourselves to be, we who have it at our disposal remain comfortably installed” (EI, p. viii;IC, p. xii). Insofar as Blanchot's essays on Lévinas also participate in the activity of writing, these essays deform Lévinas's thought by doubling it through commentary. Commentary, as Blanchot understands it, participates in literature by repeating the work. Blanchot describes his method as one that leaves the text empty by “translating it in its ambiguity through an interrogation henceforth still more ambiguous since it bears this ambiguity, bears upon it, and ends by becoming dissipated in it” (EI, p. 571;IC, p. 390).<br>

Author(s): Bono James J.<br>
Abstract: As a field of study, literature and science has gradually expanded to encompass both the impact of science on literary culture and the literary‐linguistic practices intrinsic to the production of scientific knowledge. Such transformations both reinforce and fundamentally recalibrate the detailed attention focused on scientific practice by historians of science since the 1980s. As a result, this essay and the Focus section it introduces suggest that history of science and literature and science are, in fact, interdependent fields. Attention to their convergences will yield better understanding of the performative dimensions of scientific practices and thence of science itself as a form of making of knowledge of things and events in the world of nature. Science as a form of making involves the convergence of things, material practices, and a panoply of meaningful artifacts—instruments of thought and action—that refuse any simple dichotomy between “text” and “action.”<br>

Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: My approach has something in common with that of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's
            Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey(Stanford, Calif., 2004). I differ, however, in viewing the crucial contemporary barrier to contemplation as that of an obsession with narrative rather than an obsession with meaning. (The last thing I would accuse contemporary culture of is a surfeit of intellectualism!) To be reengaged with nonnarrative phenomena does not require us to surrender all interest in meanings; perceiving the beauty of a gesture, for example, requires understanding what it signifies. Nor does it require us to surrender all interest in depth, another of Gumbrecht's targets; on the contrary, the beauty of other human beingsistheir depth, the depth of that invisible perspective which emerges in their aesthetic and everyday style. Even scientific knowledge—such as the delightful fact, inAdaptation, about Darwin's moth—can be truly enchanting, an enrichment rather than a desiccation of experience. We may well wish to save all these charming babies from going out with the “meaning” bathwater. What is more, the contemplation of orchids need, on my account, have nothing mystical about it (it would certainly not need to involve a perception of “Being”) and need not be transitory in the manner of epiphanies (orchid-lovers can happily stare at bromeliads all day). Finally, I hope to have given a substantive account of the role that the non-“presence” elements play in the fictional work; as I see it, these elements are absolutely necessary for making the flowers available in the first place.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: In saying this, I am not arguing that Marlowe “appropriated” the sacred from its dominant institutional contexts. On the contrary, the rumors of devils appearing on the Faustian stage belie that model of the relationship between the dramatic and the theological in which the theater evacuates the spiritual content from theological forms only to stage those forms within a sphere of rational disenchantment that supposedly frames the experience of a play.
   41Such a model relies on a modern, indeed modernist, understanding of theater as a compartmentalized zone of experience where entertainment has no further end than its own production and consumption, and where aesthetic efficacy, if it exists at all, remains limited to art's ability to contain the contradictions of ideology. Theatrical representation clearly had a certain kind of autonomy in Marlowe's England, produced and consumed as it was in its own institutional space, yet at the same time, as I hope I have been able to show, that very representation could be understood by antitheatrical writers and theatergoers alike as an instrument that had theological ends. Another way to put this claim is to say that theater was not always understood as a disenchanted product of human agency. When the reformers argued that Satan staged theater pieces through the instrumentality of the magician to the end of creating beliefs in the audience that would augment his own power, they were quite capable of imagining that such spectacles were well-crafted illusions without needing to go on to posit that the devil was an ideological fiction. The rumors of the Faustian devils powerfully demonstrate that even representations that announced their own theatricality—even illusions that were institutionally marked out as such—could still be understood as having theological consequences. Those who believed that the devil came when Faustus called him may have been fully invested in their faith, but they were never so gullible as to believe ~<br>

Article Title: Historicizing Religion: Varro’s<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: The fully fledged Varronian history of religion, dimly visible through the scattered two-hundred sixty fragments of the
         Antiquitates rerum divinarum, tries to construct not a Roman, but a universal history of religion, apt for a Roman polity extended all over Italy, certainly into Greece and beyond, an incipientImperium Romanum. Varro and his dedicatee, Caesar, share a perspective in this regard. This was no unilinear development. New gods were to arrive, who demanded stories about the shrinking of diversity, about resistance to unity and about differentiation judged secondary. In such narratives, conspirators like Sextus Tarquinius and Judas replaced Numa and Fulvius Nobilior.
               Ultimately, histories of “religions” instead of “religion” were written. The concept of the “church of the martyrs,” construing the survivors as legitimate successors to those killed, is put forward by religious historiographers.71
            
               These sharply defined identities are proffered in contradiction to the ambiguity and ambivalences, which obtain in the field of religion. The production of boundaries by historiographers and group leaders must not be allowed to completely obscure the existence and historical significance of the vast array of shared practices in daily life. In areas of the world where multiple (or indistinct) religious identities were the norm, many functions and forms of religious practices and beliefs occurred on a shared field between and above the boundaries invoked by distinct groups.72<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Montgomery decides that this voice begins to belong to another as soon as Eve can positively attribute it to a visible “other”—in this case the angel. But who exactly is this angel? Critics and readers often speak at this point of Satan disguised as an angel—something like the disguise he adopts in book 3 when speaking to Uriel. Relating the two scenes, Regina Schwartz claims that “with hypocrisy so hidden, it is no wonder that Eve could not penetrate the disguise of the angel who flattered her in her dream.”
         
               We should, I think, draw at least a tentative distinction between the two scenes. In book 3 we know that Satan adopts a disguise that fools even the sharpest-sighted angels, but do we know that the mysterious figure in Eve’s dream is evil disguised as good? If there is no textual evidence for Satan speaking the dream into Eve’s ear, then neither is there any reason to imagine Satan as an actor on the dream stage, playing the lead in his own production. Following Samuel, we might say that Satan “induces” the unquiet physiological state in which Eve’s mind works but that ultimately both voice and figure are her own “productions.”25<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: In Badiouan ontology, the role of the absolute infinite (divine) has been taken by “the void” conceived of as the “errant ‘place’ where each situation is sutured to its being
            quapure multiplicity or inconsistency.”
                  In other words, “the fundamental ontological characteristic of an event is to inscribe, to name the situated void of that for which it is an event.”95
               
                  According to Welborn, that explains why Paul is seen by Badiou as a foundational figure and the first great theoretician of universal truth: “Unlike effective truth-procedures which aim at the production of a universal in the domains of science, art, politics, and love, there occurs with Paul a powerful break … which deserves to be called ‘theoretical,’96
               
                  because the situated void which Paul’s proclamation inscribes and names is nothing other than death itself. Paul’s declaration ‘Christ is resurrected’ blasts open the continuum constructed around death.”97
               
                  Reynhout, in turn, in his attempt to appropriate Badiou’s thought theologically, comes to the conclusion that allows him to ultimately identify this nameless void with God, thus falling back on Tillich’s designations of God as “being-itself” or the “ground of being.”98
               
                  Depoortere depicts the analogy pointedly: “Just as zero or the empty set cannot be deduced, but has to be decided upon axiomatically, the being of God cannot be demonstrated, but has to be declared.”99

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: There are two ways of reading Goffman--as a theorist of trust and ritual accommodation, that is, as a theorist of the interaction order, or as a theorist of deception. I suggest a way of making these two readings compatible, by arguing that Goffman was interested in what I call the “production of credibility.” Credibility is the quality of being believable, and this quality is integral to both trust and deception. Viewed in this way, Goffman explored the ways in which people make their actions convincing to other people. Although Goffman's analysis of the interaction order did not need a theory of the self, his work actually contains two quite different theories of the self: one linked to role analysis, one to his analysis of mental illness. I argue for the latter at the expense of the former. I conclude that Goffman both initiated substantive work about the interaction order and contributed to a synthesis of a theory of the interaction order and a theory of the self.<br>

Abstract: The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on “detainee abuse” at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) “constructionist analytics,” I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that “really occurred” throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems.<br>

Abstract: Bruce Wilshire's "The Moral Collapse of the University: Professionalism, Purity, and Alienation" challenges the internal constituencies of research universities to assess the moral condition of their institutions. His critique emanates from a university apocalyptic literature which has been most prolific during the three undergraduate curricular crises of this century. The proponents of this genre often create negative caricatures in their desire to right perceived injustices. Although Wilshire falls victim to the myopia of absolutism, he calls attention to ethical problems and issues. His thesis centers on restoring the intergenerational task of teaching to undergraduate studies within a professoriate wedded to a research production ethos. His moral argument centers on the redefinition of education against the inroads of professionalism, specialism, and careerism. His quintessential plea is to restore the moral integrity of the mentor-learner relationship. Only with such a restoration may the university revive from its moral collapse. While the author finds both Wilshire's metaethical discussion and descriptive ethical demonstrations weak, he supports the idea of a new professional ethic for the professoriate.<br>

Abstract: This essay investigates the roots of a growing impass in contemporary architecture vis a vis the economic, technological, social and political developments of our advanced or late-capitalist society. It focuses upon architecture's apparently diminishing capacity to address our present human condition, yet argues that the problems responsible for the "crisis" of architectural thought and design in general have evolved as the result of historic processes, and therefore the impass can only partially be explained with the short-comings of modern architecture or the 'short sighted' attitude of the architects themselves. Nevertheless, it also argues that architecture, in spite of its now rather limited transformative capacity, should persistently attempt to reveal, rather than mask or otherwise escape, its fundamental relatedness to material processes; that is, to the modes of production and consumption on which social and political power relations are predicated. To be able to do so, and thus to foster a more liberating "form" of human environment, the profession needs first of all a strong political self consciousness, while aiming at a practice of critical inquiry.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Author(s): Woods Peter<br>
Abstract: Economics is privileged in contemporary government policy such that all human transactions are seen as economic forms of exchange. Education has been discursively restructured according to the logic of the market, with education policy being increasingly colonised by economic policy imperatives. This paper explores some of the consequences of this reframing which draws upon metaphors from industrial and business domains. This paper examines a significant dimension of teaching that currently has marginal presence in official discourse: social contingency. We argue that social contingency is characterised by a variety of distinctive features that include unpredictability, relationality and ethical demands. The significance of social contingency is highlighted by a comparison with industrial production, which is organisationally contingent, and craft production, which is characterised as materially contingent. We argue that the different nature of contingency in these domains makes them inappropriate as metaphors for teaching. We explore the nature of social contingency and some of the practical and ethical consequences of the failure to articulate this in official discourse. Its absence in such discourse is illustrated by consideration of competence statements in the Initial Teacher Education context. We argue that the neglect of social contingency is founded on assumptions of teacher sovereignty that are both philosophically and ethically unsustainable.<br>

Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: The contribution outlines a research programme which I have coined the "sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse). This approach to discourse integrates important insights of FOUCAULT's theory of discourse into the interpretative paradigm in the social sciences, especially the "German" approach of hermeneutic sociology of knowledge (Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie). Accordingly, in this approach discourses are considered as "structured and structuring structures" which shape social practices of enunciation. Unlike some Foucauldian approaches, this form of discourse analysis recognises the importance of socially constituted actors in the social production and circulation of knowledge. Furthermore, it combines research questions related to the concept of "discourse" with the methodical toolbox of qualitative social research. Going beyond questions of language in use, "the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse) addresses sociological interests, the analyses of social relations and politics of knowledge as well as the discursive construction of reality as an empirical ("material") process. For empirical research on discourse the approach proposes the use of analytical concepts from the sociology of knowledge tradition, such as interpretative schemes or frames (Deutungsmuster), "classifications", "phenomenal structure" (Phänomenstruktur), "narrative structure", "dispositif" etc., and the use of the methodological strategies of "grounded theory".<br>

Author(s): Chenavier Robert<br>
Abstract: Au cours d'une période qui voit Husserl livrer son testament philosophique, la Krisis, l'étudiante Simone Weil ouvre son Diplôme d'études supérieures, en 1930, par le constat du désarroi dans lequel se trouve l'époque et de l'incertitude dans laquelle nous laisse la science. Il faut opérer un retour à Descartes, dans une automéditation proche de celle que recommandait Husserl. Cependant Simone Weil ne s'oriente pas vers une phénoménologie. Loin d'explorer la sphère d'être du cogito, elle cherche à en sortir, plus rapidement encore que Descartes, pour rencontrer la réalité du monde, et inventer une sagesse pour notre condition d'être percevant, ce qui signifie, avant tout, d'être qui travaille. Seul le travail permet d'éprouver la nécessité réelle, et de retrouver « l'union de l'âme et du monde », dans les conditions créées par l'industrie. C'est dans la ligne de la vocation mondaine de la philosophie de Descartes, que Simone Weil amorce sa réflexion sur le rôle du travail comme fondement d'une sagesse, dans ces nouvelles conditions d'existence déterminées par la forme collective de la production. À partir de 1935, elle verra dans la crise un signe de la « faillite de Descartes ». During the period that Husserl was declaring his philosophical testament, Die Krisis, Simone Weil was a student starting her Diplôme d'études supérieures in 1930, mindful of the utter confusion of the times and of the atmosphere of uncertainty generated by science. One must return to Descartes, in a self-meditation similar to the one recommended by Husserl. But Simone Weil did not move toward a phenomenology. Far from exploring the sphere of being through the cogito principle, she sought to escape from that sphere, even more rapidly than did Descartes, in order to confront the reality of the world and to invent a wisdom for the condition of a conscious being, which means, above all, a being who works. Only work makes it possible to experience real necessity and to reestablish « the union of~<br>

Author(s): Jacobs Anton K.<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Abstract: Die Theorie der Psychoanalyse als Theorie des psychoanalytischen Verfahrens wird in den Zusammenhang der philosophischen Tradition des 19. Jahrhunderts gestellt. Sie wird als „Kritische Theorie” mit der vorrangigen wissenschaftlichen Auflage, das psychoanalytische Ziel, Emanzipation zu begründen, eingeführt. Die Grenzen ihres Anwendungsbereichs — emotionale Kommunikation — werden extensiv wie intensiv aus der übergeordneten Dialektik der Produktivkräfte und Produktions-verhältnisse ableitbar angesehen. Die psychoanalytische Metapsychologie als naturwissenschaftliche Theorie des psychischen Apparats wird insoweit konzediert, als sie sich dem Versuch, die von ihr ermittelten Fakten emanzipatorisch aufzuheben, nicht sperrt. L'auteur présente la théorie de la psychoanalyse considérée comme théorie de la pratique psychoanalytique dans ses rapports avec la tradition philosophique du XIXe siècle. Il la conçoit comme Kritische Theorie ayant donc pour objet scientifique primordial d'établir l'émancipation comme but de la psychoanalyse. Les limites de son champ d'application — la communication émotionelle — sont jugés de manière extensive et intensive comme dérivants de la dialectique générale des forces productrices et des conditions économiques. La métapsychologie psychoanalytique, théorie scientifique de l'appareil psychique, ne se justifie que dans la mesure où elle ne se refuse pas à tenter d'insérer les données empiriques dans le plan de l'émancipation. The theory of psychoanalysis as theory of the psychoanalytical method is placed within the tradition of 19th century philosophy. It is introduced as "critical theory" (Kritische Theorie) under the paramount condition of substantiating the aim of psychoanalysis — emancipation. The limits of its scope of application — emotional communication — are considered to be traceable — both extensively and intensively — from the superordinate dialectic of forces and conditions of production. Psychoanalytical metapsychology as scient~<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the production of an Islamic utopian or millennial discourse by British South Asian Muslims in the diasporic public sphere and its possible impact on the younger generation of Muslims growing up in the UK. Associated with such a discourse, the article considers the vulnerability of diasporas — the process whereby global events can precipitate radical diasporic estrangement, leading to self-estrangement. Such estrangement is fed by moral panics, expressed in the speeches of politicians, in newspaper columns and global news reports. This exposes the fragility of multicultural discourses in the public sphere in the UK.<br>

Abstract: The correlation of narrative and ethics has a long history in literature, and frequently ethics has been associated with a transcendental notion of truth. The recent attention to narrative and theology has offered more theoretical reflections of both poetic and hermeneutical practices that return us to the earliest literary, philosophical and theological productions. In this essay, I wish to present a different way of examining the correlation of narrative and ethics; one less orientated towards Scripture and less concerned with the Church. The narratives I consider are secular fictions from the modernist period. Through examining these works phenomenologically and the role the imagination plays in the production of beliefs, I argue that all narratives structure emotions, desires and hopes and this structuring continually opens up a transcendent horizon.<br>

Abstract: L'attitude de Strauss en faveur de l'idée d'un retour au droit des Anciens ne doit pas être
confondue cependant avec celle de Heidegger en dépit d'analogies apparentes L'auteur de la
Lettre sur l'humanisme (1946), suite à sa dénonciation de l'humanisme moderne solidaire de la
métaphysique entendue comme impérialisme de la subjectivité, opte délibérément pour « la
grande époque grecque », très précisémente pour la pensée de l'Être telle qu'il croit la retrouver
à l'état natif chez les Présocratiques pour qui la Vérité est « dévoilement ». D'où l'invocation au
sens originaire du droit (dikè) chez Anaximandre, pensé à partir de l'Être et non pas du sujet.
Mais, même si toute cette démarche est explicitement dirigée contre le nihilisme engendré par
une valorisation qui est subjectivation, en réalité elle conduit au résultat inverse de celui pour-
suivi par Strauss (qui, comme Arendt, en appelle contre le subjectivisme des modernes plutôt à
Aristote et au classicisme grec). L'affirmation heideggérienne ultime selon laquelle il n'y a pas
d'autre fondement à nos choix existentiaux qu'une décision elle-même dépourvue de fondement
est le nihilisme même, et d'autant plus redoutable que l'accompagne, sous prétexte de victoire
sur lui et de conversion à l'authenticité, une fascination - au nom de la pensée de l'Être - pour
l'abîme de l'enracinement dans le sol d'où émergerait toute production humaine comme pure-
ment factuelle.<br>

le fait que la consommation du bien par une personne ne diminue en rien la possibilité pour une
autre de le consommer.<br>

Abstract: Dans son ouvrage, Judith Butler (2002 : 136-37) souligne l'ambivalence des
processus d'assujettissement. En se référant plus particulièrement à Surveiller et
punir. Naissance de la prison de Foucault (1975), et en rétablissant la notion
de « sujet » comme effet et produit de l'assujettissement, elle écrit : « Foucault
suggère que le prisonnier n'est pas régulé par une relation extérieure au pouvoir,
du type de celle par laquelle une institution prend un individu donné pour cible
de ses objectifs de subordination. Au contraire, l'individu est formé ou plutôt
formulé à travers son "identité" de prisonnier de manière discursive. L'assujettis-
sement est littéralement la fabrication d'un sujet, le principe de régulation à tra-
vers lequel un sujet est formulé ou produit. Pareil assujettissement est un type
de pouvoir qui ne se contente pas d'agir unilatéralement, en tant que forme de
domination sur un individu donné, mais qui de plus active ou forme le sujet.
Ainsi l'assujettissement n'est ni simplement la domination ni la production d'un
sujet; il désigne un certain type de restriction dans la production, une restriction
sans laquelle la production du sujet ne saurait avoir lieu. »<br>

Abstract: Cet article interroge les modes de production et de reproduction des récits de migration. Les histoires seront traitées non seulement comme sources de recherche ethnographique et comme enquête journalistique, mais aussi comme des moyens spécifiques de comprendre et de façonner l'expérience de la migration. De cette façon, nous viserons moins à alimenter un débat méthodologique sur l'usage des matériaux biographiques dans une recherche qualitative, qu'à mettre en lumière les multiples effets de ce phénomène sur la société, en termes de création d'une demande d'histoires de migration et, par conséquence, d'un véritable « marché de mots » où les migrants, qui ont acquis une solide maîtrise narrative, peuvent troquer leurs récits de vie contre une reconnaissance sociale, du prestige ou même de l'argent. This article studies the ways migration narratives are being produced and reproduced. Such stories shall be treated not only as sources of the ethnographical research and journalistic enquiry, but also as specific ways of understanding and shaping the experience of migration. This way I intend—more than feeding the methodological debate of how to use the biographical materials in a research—to highlight the multiple effects of this phenomenon over society, in terms of creation of a market of migrational stories. In this market, migrants, acting as true narrative experts, can exchange their stories for social recognition, prestige, or even money.<br>

Author(s): Gordon Lewis R.<br>
Abstract: In celebration of the fortieth anniversary of CODESRIA, an institution from the Global South devoted to taking responsibility for the production of social science knowledge, this article explores what it means to pursue such a task under the threat of colonial imposition at methodological and disciplinary levels, which, the author argues, carries dangers of disciplinary decadence marked by the fetishisation of method. The author offers alternatives through what he calls 'a teleological suspension' of disciplinarity, and raises the question not only of the decolonisation of knowledge but also norms. Pour célébrer le quarantième anniversaire du CODESRIA, une institution des pays du Sud dévouée dans la production de connaissances en sciences sociales, cet article explore les implications de mener une telle tâche sous la menace de l'emprise coloniale à des niveaux méthodologiques et disciplinaires, qui, selon l'auteur, provoque des dangers sur la décadence disciplinaire marquée par la divination de la méthode. L'auteur propose des alternatives à travers ce qu'il appelle « une suspension téléologique » de l'interdisciplinarité, et pose la question non seulement de la décolonisation de la connaissance, mais aussi celle des normes.<br>

Abstract: Les auteurs proposent de concevoir les idéologies politiques comme des « trames », c'est-à-dire des véhicules de narration qui organisent la production de récits identitaires. Cette proposition, de pair avec l'analyse compréhensive des idéologies, pourrait apporter une solution aux problèmes liés au changement et à la permanence de ces procédés rhétoriques, thématiques, symboliques, etc. Pour illustrer cette théorie, les auteurs analysent le cas de la Navarre depuis le dernier tiers du XIXe siècle. On peut ainsi observer comment l'affrontement de deux trames idéologiques a provoqué le grave conflit d'identité dont souffre cette communauté depuis la transition démocratique. It is being suggested here that ideologies can be conceived of as « textures » or narrative vehicles organizing the production of identity-narratives. That suggestion together with the related understanding analysis of ideologies may solve the problems tied to change and permanence in their rhetorical, topical and symbolic processes. To illustrate their theory, the authors study the case of Navarra since the late 19th century, showing how the antagonism of two ideological textures yielded the deep identity conflict that has been affecting this community since the democratic transition.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>

Abstract: This article is a wide-ranging consideration of the role that contemporary academic psychology might play in the study of the Bible. I begin by examining the historical reasons for suspicion of psychology within the community of biblical scholarship, focusing on several perennial objections. Having addressed these objections, I go on to set out a framework for the legitimate use of psychology in enhancing understanding of the process of production and reception of the biblical texts, and of elucidating their meaning. Finally, I suggest that some contemporary methodological quality-control systems from psychology might inform the question of what constitutes a good reading of a particular text. I explore this issue further by using the example of trauma processing in relation to the New Testament, suggesting that if the text is to be received as transformative, a good reading is likely to be dissonant, challenging, or ugly.<br>

Abstract: The philosophy of economics has been largely guided by analytic philosophy. Even Marx has been appropriated without much scandal by economists who separate his scientific contributions from his politics. In this article, I place philosophical hermeneutics (i.e., Heidegger and Ricoeur) in dialogue with the conventional understanding of land as a factor of production. The history of political economy misunderstands land as an entity classifiable as property and capital. I argue instead that land's ontological role, deriving from Heidegger's concept of earth, suggests that economics needs to account for it in a new way according to David Ricardo's notion of land rent.<br>

Abstract: Rethinking, 29, n. 120. I use the phrase in debating the views of Tamar
Chana Reich, "A Battlefield of a Text: Inner Textual Interpretation in the Sanskrit
Mahäbhärata," Ph.D. dissertation, Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998:
"Granted we 'know' the Mbh as a text that 'grew, and became what it is by expan-
sion' (with italics), but not that it took eight 'centuries of textual production.'...
Reich [thinks the Mbh develops through] eight-hundred year[s]... of 'contestatory
discourse' governed by an 'aesthetic of expansion' (citing Reich 51, 32, and 31 suc-
cessively). This aesthetic better befits a short period of controlled, consensual 'con-
testation,' and also shared conventions, which do not last forever" - indeed, my
note goes on to show that "Reich sometimes points in this direction." It is in any
case the first thing I say in the book about conventions (353 [Index]).<br>

Abstract: Igual que le sucedía a Geertz cuando se apropiaba de complejas ideas de otros, sustituyendo complicados desarrollos conceptuales por one liners ingeniosos, cuando la hermenéutica geertziana o sus equivalentes se trasladan a otras disciplinas donde rigen otras reglas, la simplificación es no sólo palpable sino muy probablemente sistemática. Su recurrencia revela patrones actuantes y manierismos endémicos al modo de producción textual de ciertas corrientes de las humanidades tendientes a la literatura. En muchos de estos casos, aunque ellos sean densamente verbosos en otros respectos, en los textos en los que se da cabida a las influencias teóricas que vienen desde afuera nunca hay espacio disponible, típicamente, para hacer justicia a la fenomenal complejidad de las ideas. Same happened to Geertz when appropriating ideas from other complex, replacing complicated by conceptual developments witty one liners, when the hermeneutics Geertzian or their equivalents are transferred to other disciplines where other rules apply, simplifıcation is not only palpable but very likely systematic. Recurrence reveals patterns and mannerisms endemic acting mode of textual production of certain currents of the humanities tend to literature. In many cases, even though they are densely wordy in other respects, the texts on which accommodates the theoretical influences that never come from outside space is available, typically, to do justice to the great complexity of ideas.<br>

Abstract: L'influence de l'école de Manchester sur la production historique et sa filiation de long terme
avec l'historicisme anthropologique contemporain mais aussi certaines formes d'histoire sociale
(Cefaï, ed. 2010; Gribaudi 1998) sont à mettre en parallèle avec l'essor du Centre for Contemporary
Cultural Studies de Birmingham à partir de 1964, autour de Raymond Williams, Richard Hoggart,
Stuart Hall, ou encore des recherches d'Edward P. Thompson (1963). En Italie, le contexte.../...
[Suite de la note 2] intellectuel de naissance de la microstoria est fortement influencé par des
problématiques anthropologiques, comme le montrent très bien les travaux de Carlo Ginzburg
et leurs prolongements jusqu'à aujourd'hui, ou encore le fait que Le Saint lévrier de Jean-Claude
Schmitt (2004 [1979]) soit traduit dans une collection de microstoria, tout en incluant une
interrogation fondamentale sur la nature des liens sociaux, davantage illustrée par les œuvres de
Giovanni Levi ou Maurizio Gribaudi. Ce développement parallèle explique la jonction entre pro-
blématiques sociales et culturelles au sein d'une approche anthropologico-historique, qui n'a pas
eu d'équivalent en France dans un premier temps, dans la mesure où la réception des œuvres
d'anthropologues comme Roger Bastide et ou Georges Balandier a été très limitée chez les histo-
riens français, tournés principalement vers les travaux de Claude Lévi-Strauss - et dont témoigne
encore l'intérêt limité porté par les historiens aux travaux comme ceux de Denys Cuche ou Erwan
Dianteill, qui poursuivent aujourd'hui cette direction de recherche.<br>

Author(s): Griffioen Sander<br>
Abstract: See for instance Lire le Capital, I, pp. 47f, 169f. See also MansChot, op. cit.,
pp. IV—17, IV—21f. 'Not in the superstructure' does not mean here simply 'then
it is in the basis'. The 'problem' is that scientific thought, as thought, cannot be
put in the same category as material powers of production; cf. Lire le Capital,
p. 47 : 'Ce système de production théorique, système matériel autant que "spiri-
tuel"...'. Manschot admits 'that Althusser has not yet been able to develop a new
formulation of the problem of the relation science-society. Strictly speaking, he has
not got further than the assertion that the old notions of this relationship are no
longer tenable'. (IV—22).<br>

réemploie la même définition en V.18 mais la réinterprète en disant que c'est un
savoir qui connaît l'absence de destruction et de production, puisque tout est vide
de nature propre et que rien n'est proprement ni produit ni détruit.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues for theatre as a mode of becoming rather than one of vanishing. By working through the temporal constructs that have traditionally fostered a sense of transience in performance, this essay attempts to establish appearance as a category of thought. It focuses on the praxis of performance, taking as its example a 2002 production in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival entitled machines machines machines machines machines machines machines and its subsequent unfolding in the everyday. Contrary to the dominant critical model of thought that casts theatre as inevitably and unstoppably moving towards its own end, absence, and death, this essay contends that performance is a force of animate presence, continuation, and becoming.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>

Author(s): McDonald Peter D.<br>
Abstract: The continuing fallout from the theory wars, evident not least in the nostalgic after-theory narrative that is still in vogue, has dissipated critical energy in contemporary literary studies. Rejecting that narrative, this essay calls for a review of the legacy of theory and the polemical oppositions that set it against other scholarly enterprises, like book history. In particular, it suggests that the theoretical interrogation of the category of literature in the past forty years fruitfully intersects with book history's investigation of the material conditions of literary production, opening up new possibilities for literary historiography, while also imposing new demands on it. The essay identifies two traditions of antiessentialist thought (the skeptical and the enchanted), considers the ontology of the printed literary text, and examines the legacies of, among others, Jacques Derrida and Pierre Bourdieu.<br>

Author(s): Elfenbein Andrew<br>
Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: Kearney thus summarizes Kant's "Copernican Revolution": "Being would henceforth
be conceived not as the transcendent origin of meaning, but as a representation of the human
subject—or, more precisely, as a production of the human imagination. This is what Kant had
in mind when he affirmed that 'being is not a real predicate . . . but only the positing of a
thing'" (Wake 157-58<br>

Abstract: The attentions given to textual production in composition scholarship have led to a neglect of the dynamics of textual reception. Renewed acquaintance with the discipline of hermeneutics will provide scholars and instructors with a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between interpretive processes and rhetorical strategies. Building on the work of Phelps, Mailloux, and Crusius, this article revisits Gadamer and Ricoeur, two of the more prominent scholars of modern hermeneutics, for the purpose of applying their principles to learning objectives and class assignments in college-level writing courses.<br>

Abstract: The memorialisation of the Partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 through popular cinema is the theme of this paper. Both in India and Pakistan, cinema as a cultural production wields immense influence in the lives of the people and mainstream cinema has been deeply affected by Partition. By offering the potential for public mourning in a public space such as a theatre, cinema confronts the trauma of that cataclysmic event and Partition cinema in particular invests heavily in the private sphere of emotions and familial relations while also demonstrating that the private domain is already political.<br>

Abstract: Historians today frequently feel torn between the requirements of basic research (which implies scientific method and independent scholarship) and the demands of a society asking for relevance and readability. Two trends have developed within the craft since the nineteenth century: one, positivist and professional, oriented towards the sole production and transmission of knowledge; the other trying to broaden the historian's aims and to make history socially useful (hence the introduction of the notion of "applied history"). After analysing the assets as well as the perils of both approaches, the article argues that are conciliation between them appears possible provided a number of methodological requisites are met. Modern historians should not be afraid of new functions and new tasks in society.<br>

Abstract: Dans le cadre du séminaire Bonheur et Travail qui a débouché sur une enquête de l'Insee, Céline Bessière et Frédérique Houseaux ont pu « suivre des enquêteurs » et tirer de leurs observations de terrain quelques conclusions sur la production de données statistiques. Une passation mouvementée du questionnaire auprès d'un salariéagricole agricole montre l'importance de la situation d'enquête ainsi que celle des malentendus sur les mots utilisés. Les auteurs proposent de s'appuyer sur ces «ratés» de la relation d'enquête pour mettre en lumière le rôle souvent oublié de l'enquêteur. Elles suggèrent enfin de rapprocher enquêteurs et concepteurs et d'utiliser les données produites en gardant à l'esprit le travail de traduction qui a présidé à leur fabrication. Christian Baudelot et Michel Gollac en tirent la conclusion qu'il faut «faire avec» et refusent de renoncer aux gains de connaissance qu'apportent les enquêtes statistiques. Ils plaident qu'à condition de ne pas s'y enfermer, on peut les utiliser pour combattre l'ethnocentrisme même qui a pu présider à leur recueil. Florence Weber s'interroge sur la nature de l'interaction entre enquêteur Insee et enquêté: «relation anonyme et formulaire d'enquête» se conjuguent pour la rapprocher des relations qu'entretiennent d'autres agents subalternes de l'État avec les administrés. En jouant sur la nature des questions posées, on déplace simplement le lieu où se produisent les malentendus, à la fois instructifs et constructifs. Enfin, Alain Desrosières se demande «à quoi sert une enquête». Si les mêmes critiques, formulées depuis des décennies, n'ont jamais fait obstacle à la répétition des enquêtes statistiques, c'est que leur enjeu n'est pas seulement cognitif mais aussi politique. Il faut donc restituer la visée d'usage des enquêtes et les moyens sociaux des produits et des énoncés statistiques. Within the scope of the Happiness and Work seminar that led to an Insee survey, Céline Bessière and Frédérique Houseaux were able t~<br>

Abstract: Este ensaio pretende estabelecer correlações entre Literatura, História e História da Literatura do ângulo da Estética Expectacional. Essa posição desloca o tradicional enfoque da literatura da perspectiva da produção para a da recepção, extraindo da obra literária uma abundância de sentimentos em harmonia com as expectativas de cada período, de cada grupo social, de cada nível cultural, tornando-a, assim, uma estrutura móvel, capaz de valer em diferentes contextos e de dar respostas diversas, conforme a demanda de verdade estética. Com isto, a História da Literatura tem condições de incorporar a marcha das ondas inovadoras no percurso da prática textual em dada sociedade, assim como reter, para cada época, as qualificações do horizonte de expectativa, que tornam instantâneas todas as épocas pregressas do fazer literário. /// This essay tries to establish correlations between Literature, History and History of Literature as viewed by Expectational aesthetics. Such a view shifts the traditional approach of literature from production to reception, extracting from the literary work a profusion of feelings in harmony with the prospect of each period, of each social group, of each cultural level. This makes it a movable structure capable of functioning in different contexts and of providing several answers, according to the demand of aesthetic truth. Thanks to this, the History of Literature is capable of incorporating the shifts of innovative waves in the trend to textual practice in a certain society, as well as retain, for each age, the qualifications of the horizon of expectation. This turns all the previous ages of literary making momentary.<br>

Abstract: International and national agendas are redesigning the terms of intellectual-property (IP) Laws to create cultural property for developing nations. Debates over IP and cultural-property "rights" or legal needs for "protection" are critical to anthropology's effort to reflect on how the production of knowledge, even culture itself, is variously construed to originate with, or "belong to," particular individuals, ethnic communities, or nation-states. We explore the implications of two Indonesian legal documents to show the disjunction between discourses of regional artists who describe the ritual exchanges, relationships, and transgenerational messages their arts shape and (inter)nationalists legal initiatives that bypass artists' concepts of process, access, and authority in an effort to disembed and control ritual-based expressions as products with exclusive owners.<br>

Abstract: Oponiéndose a la perspectiva que reduce toda problemática vinculada a las drogas al orden del exceso y descontrol, este trabajo interroga la articulación entre ciertas consecuencias del capitalismo neoliberal en Argentina y la variación en las prácticas de consumo de drogas en conjuntos sociales vulnerables. Particularmente, examino el vínculo entre el sufrimiento social generado por la violencia cotidiana y el trauma crónico engendrado por la pobreza y la exclusión social y el consumo de cierta sustancia popularmente denominada "pasta". La producción del olvido, la fragmentación de la memoria y la disociación son los estados que los usuarios asocian y/o promueven con el uso de esta sustancia. De este modo, el argumento de este trabajo consiste en que mientras el uso de drogas se convierte en una de las pocas alternativas que los jóvenes disponen para aliviar el sufrimiento social asociado con la destitución social, esta condena al olvido limita el potencial para que los recuerdos y las experiencias se conviertan en materia prima para el trabajo de la memoria, la constitución de una capital emocional compartido e identidades sociales complejas. /// This work, opposing to the perspective that reduces all problems related with drugs to excess and lack of control, deals with the articulation between some consequences of neoliberal capitalism in Argentina and the variation in practices of drug taking in vulnerable social groups. It analizes especially the link between social suffering generated by day-to-day violence, chronical trauma engendered by poverty and social exclusion, and the taking of a substance popularly called "pasta". Production of forgetfulness, fragmentation of memory and dissociation are the conditions associated or promoted by consumers through the use of this substance. The point of this work is that while the use of drugs becomes one of the few alternatives young people have to aliviate social suffering associated with social destituteness, it conde~<br>

Abstract: Régulièrement proclamés partout dans le monde, la liberté d'expression et le pluralisme de la presse sont considérés comme des instruments de mesure démocratique. Seulement en France, où le journaliste porte dans son hérédité la tradition littéraire du débat d'idées, la diversité des opinions tend à se réduire. La déontologie professionnelle est associée à des dispositifs visant à établir l'objectivité – procédés linguistiques, recours systématique à des études sociologiques – dont les effets sont souvent de restreindre le jugement ou du moins de le conformer à des faits « scientifiquement » établis. L'observation, l'intuition, l'enquête sont ainsi supplantées par des protocoles qui agissent comme des écrans dans la démocratie d'opinion. Alors même que l'on continue d'accuser les médias de manipulation, la production endogène d'une pensée commune est une des raisons de sa perte d'influence. Generally claimed around the world, freedom of speech and press pluralism are considered as instruments of democratic measure. However in France where the journalist has in his heredity the literary tradition of ideologic debates, the diversity of opinions is lowering. Professional deontology is linked with rhetoric devices – linguistic process, resort to sociological inquiries – whose effects are often to refrein assesments or to produce them, according to « scientifically » set up items. Investigation, intuition, clearsightedness are overlapped by procedures which appear as screens in relationship to the public opinion. Even if the media are accused of manipulation, the endogeneous production of a commun thought is one of the reasons of their lack of influence.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes an interpretive reading of contemporary Algerian cultural practice as providing 'techniques of living' in which social memories of traumatic experiences are encoded. Working across several genres—literary fiction, popular music, scholarship, autobiography, political humor, and journalism—the essay seeks to delineate the economy of narration through which intensely disruptive experiences of exile and war, and competing ways of accounting for them, are internalized and expressed in the social production of self-narratives. تقوم المقالة بقراءة تأويلية للممارسات الثقافية ﺍﻟﺠﺰﺍﺋﺮﻳﺔ المعاصرة بوصفها ((تقنيات للعيش))٬ حيث تتحول ذكريات اجتماعية واسترجاعات جماعية للتجارب الفاجعة ٳلى أعمال أدبية وفنية بثغراتها الخاصة. وتتطرق المقالة ٳلى أجناس فنية ونقدية متعددة ـ الرواية الأدبية والموسيقى ﺍﻟﺮﺍﺋﺠﺔ والدراسات الأكاديمية والسير الذاتية والفكاهة ذات الطابع السياسي والصحافة ـ ساعية ٳلى ترسيم الاقتصاد الرمزي الذي عبره يتم احتواء تجارب الحرب والمنفى ﺍﻟﻤﻌﻄﱢﻠﺔ احتواءً نفسياً والتعبير عنها في نتاج يعكس الذات .<br>

Abstract: Dans Les Chemins du paradis, André Gorz cite un passage des Grundrisse de Marx, qui va
dans le même sens : « Avec la suppression du caractère immédiat du travail-vivant comme seulement
individuel-singulier [...] et l'affirmation de l'activité des individus comme immédiatement générale
et sociale [...], les moments matériels de la production sont dépouillés de la forme de l'aliénation ;
ils sont posés comme propriété, comme corps social organique où les individus se reproduisent dans
leur singularité, mais comme des singuliers sociaux. » (Cité dans Gorz [1983], p. 75, note 8.) « L'être
social » des Grundrisse a remplacé « l'être générique » des Manuscrits de 1844 ou de L'Idéologie
allemande.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: En marge de la liturgie des saints anges et de la figure anonyme de l'ange gardien que le catholicisme affecte à la protection de chaque fidèle, existe aujourd'hui une angélologie postulant l'existence de soixante-douze anges gardiens nommés et spécialisés, assignés à l'humanité entière en fonction de la date de naissance de l'individu. À travers l'étude des ouvrages concernant ces anges et de quelques entretiens, cet article analyse la construction de cette figure de l'ange, différente de celle que reconnaît l'Église. Cette production syncrétique reprend certains éléments de la conception catholique moderne de l'ange tutélaire et du saint, mais s'inspire aussi des spéculations théologiques des premiers siècles sur les anges, des doctrines kabbalistiques de la Remaissance, de l'occultisme du XIXe siècle et de l'astrologie zodiacale moderne. /// At the frontiers of the liturgy of the Holy Angels and the nameless figure of the guardian angel that catholicism assigns to protect each of the faithful, an angelology has now emerged, proposing the existence of seventy-two guardian angels each with their own name and specialized role, assigned to all humanity according to each person's date of birth. Studying published works on these angels and in the course of a number of interviews, the present article analyses the construction of this figure of the angel, an image that differs from the one recognized by the Catholic Church. This syncretic production takes up certain elements of the modern catholic conception of the angel as guardian and of the saints, but bases itself also on the theoretical speculations on the angels during the first centuries, on the kabbalistic doctrines of the Renaissance, on 19th century occultism and the modern astrology of the zodiac. /// Al margen de la liturgia de los santos ángeles y de la figura anónima del ángel custodio que el catolicismo destina a la protección de cada fiel, existen hoy especulaciones postulando la existencia de setenta y d~<br>

Abstract: Hugo Friedrich's use of mostly negative terms for the description of modern lyrics in Die Struktur der modernen Lyrik (1956) results to a large extent from a static concept of metaphor as substitution and from an implicit acceptance of the "given order of things." Though Friedrich asserts that this terminology is descriptive rather than pejorative, it impacts his interpretation of poetry. Based on Paul Ricoeur's Die lebendige Metapher(1986), this article reexamines one of Friedrich's examples, Rimbaud's "Marine." This poem provides in exemplary fashion a depiction of the metaphoric process of creative, poetic metaphors: transformation as a succession of destruction and production in the realm of land and sea. The tension and play between sameness and difference inherent in the metaphoric paradigm reveals in "Marine" a dynamic process rather than a stable order violated as Friedrich's concept of similarity suggests.<br>

Abstract: Memory and forgetting are key subjects of current historical and sociological research. Their meaning embraces passive as well as active forms of collective recollection and oblivion, activities of retention as well as of dynamic shifting in the broad field of symbolic representation. Applied to Rezeptionsgeschichte and Wirkungsgeschichte in the perspective of the Classical Tradition, those key terms signify the complex interplay between change and continuity. The materials discussed under this assumption mainly range from theories and practices of memory in Antiquity and the Middle Ages to Renaissance systems of architecture and art, from the early emergence of advanced civilizations to a modern conceptualized history of cultural change. The connecting element is the theoretically defined concept of "cultural memory" not only comprising textuality and literary techniques of memory but also image production and ritual activities in non-literate societies. At the end the question will be asked, whether there are any alternative ways of culture-investigation lying hidden within cultural memory itself.<br>

Abstract: The authors outline a sociology of narrative-an analysis of the role of narrative in various social contexts, including academic sociolegal scholarship. Narratives are social acts that depend for their production and cognition on norms of performance and content that specify when, what, how, and why stories are told. Because narratives are situationally produced and interpreted, they have no necessary political or epistemological valence but depend on the particular context and organization of their production for their political effect. The analysis specifies the variable conditions that produce hegemonic tales-stories that reproduce existing relations of power and inequity-and subversive stories-narratives that challenge the taken-for-granted hegemony by making visible and explicit the connections between particular lives and social organization.<br>

Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of the articles in Educational Studies in Mathematics since 1990.

We outline the theoretical framework of our tool of analysis and discuss briefly some of the methodological difficulties we face. We then present our findings from the analysis of the journal and we also give one example of how we 'read' an article, illustrating the rules whereby criteria are applied.<br>

Author(s): Yin Alain<br>
Abstract: Les méthodes utilisées majoritairement en économie sont la modélisation mathématique et les approches quantitatives. La narration, dont on a usé dans le passé, notamment en économie industrielle, semble avoir disparu. Est-ce réellement le cas? Une résurgence de la démarche narrative en économie ne pourraitelle pas constituer une source de diversité méthodologique? Telles sont les questions que pose cet article. La première partie montre que la narration continue à être utilisée, mais comme une forme ancillaire des méthodologies dominantes. Sur le rôle joué par la narration vis-à-vis de la modélisation, le cas du statut du récit de l'adoption du clavier QWERTY et de son maintien dans le cadre de la théorie de la dépendance de cheminement (path dependency) sert de support à l'analyse. Un autre cas illustre le rôle potentiel de la narration dans les études quantitatives. La seconde partie présente la démarche narrative comme une approche exploratoire et s'efforce de montrer dans quels cas, et à quelles conditions, elle peut conduire à des apports originaux. /// Economic analysis appears primarily based on modelisation and making use of quantitative methods. In particular narratives on case studies which had for long prevailed in industrial economics have noticeably receded. Yet, is it as straight-forward? Is it not thinkable to propose a structured narrative approach that would have increased scientific legitimacy and added diversity in the field? The paper focuses on these issues. The first part discusses to what extent narratives may be said having disappeared from economics scientific production. It illustrates that they still play an effective ancillary role as a key source for theorisation. Evidence is given from the analysis of the QWERTY story and its relationship to the emergence of the path dependency theory. Other seminal economic works are reviewed which show that, properly performed, the narrative approach has scope for bringing new insights under the domin~<br>

Publisher: Society for American Archaeology<br>
Issue: i369292<br>
Date: 4 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Zigmond Alanah<br>
Abstract: Great Basin ethnography contains little information concerning rock art, suggesting that much of it is pre-Numic. The presence of historic rock art, however, should permit differences between pre-Numic and Numic populations to be identified. Anthropological theory suggests pioneer groups use ritual to socialize the landscape. Rock art may also be associated with colonizing groups to secure access to new resources. Numic populations seem to have responded to pre-Numic rock art through modification of the art. Once the landscape had been re-socialized rock art was generally avoided. This explains why rock art production became sporadic, and memory of it lost. /// La etnografía de Great Basin contiene poca información del arte rupestre, sugiriendo que mucho del este arte en roca es pre-Numic. La presencia del arte rupestre histórico debe identificar diferencias entre poblaciones pre-Numic y Numic.

El arte rupestre estaría asociado con la colonización de grupos, para afianzar acceso a nuevos recursos. Las poblaciones Numic parecen haber respondido al arte pre-Numic a través de la modificación del arte. Una vez que el paisaje se había resocializado, el arte rupestre generalmente se evitó. Esto explica porqué la producción del arte rupestre fue esporádica, y su memoria se perdió.<br>

Article Title:  Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldûn Orientalist <br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i369543<br>
Date: 2 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Shatzmiller Abdelmajid<br>
Abstract: Despite the increasing interest in translation in the last two decades, there has been no investigation of the translation of historiography and its transformation from one language to another. This article takes as a case study the translation into French of Ibn Khaldûn, the fourteenth-century North African historian. It considers specifically the translation done by William de Slane in the context of the colonization of Algeria. The Histoire des Berbères, the French narrative of Ibn Khaldûn that relates to the history of Arabs and Berbers in the Maghreb, has become since then the source of French knowledge of North Africa. It is upon that French narrative that colonial and post-colonial historians have constructed their knowledge of North Africa, of Arabs, and of Berbers. The article shows how a portion of the writing of Ibn Khaldûn was translated and transformed in the process in such a way as to become a French narrative with colonial categories specific to the nineteenth century. Using a semiotic approach and analyzing both the French text and its original, the article shows how colonialism introduced what Castoriadis calls an "imaginary" by transforming local knowledge and converting it into colonial knowledge. In showing this the essay reveals that not only is translation not the transmission of a message from one language to another, it is indeed the production of a new text. For translation is itself the product of an imaginary, a creation-in Ricoeur's words, a "restructuring of semantic fields."<br>

Author(s): Young Carole<br>
Abstract: Narratives of the Tibetan resistance army are not a part of national history in the Tibetan exile community. Drawing on stories by veterans of the resistance to the Chinese invasion and the explanations they give of its absence in Tibetan national history, I argue that this history has been "arrested" because of the challenges it poses to normative versions of history and community and, in turn, to internal and external representations of Tibet. This practice signifies the postponing of narrating certain histories until a time in the future when the dangers they pose to sustaining a unified Tibetan community in exile has receded. This practice of historical (un)production offers insight into temporality and subjectivity, plural identities in the face of national hegemony, and why history might be considered a combination of truth, fear, and lies.<br>

Article Title: Workers in the New Economy: Transformation as Border Crossing<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i370173<br>
Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Walkerdine Valerie<br>
Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i371785<br>
Date: 10 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Vianna Jonathon<br>
Abstract: Popular music plays important roles in two related films portraying Brazilian slum life. Based on a 1953 play by Vinícius de Morais, Marcel Camus's 1959 film Orfeu Negro, and a 1999 feature by Brazilian director Carlos Diegues titled Orfeu, augment traditional samba styles with bossa nova and rap, respectively. Interpreting musical style as allegorical texts within fictive landscapes, this paper examines conflation and conflict among musical meanings, Brazilian social histories, and discursive identities marking the twentieth century. Broad aspects of Brazilian political and socio-cultural development are implicated, such as authoritarianism, the politics and sociology of race, technological advances, mass media, and modes of modernisation. Here, bossa nova and rap engage society through reflexive and generative interpretations within a narrative designed to illustrate connections between processes of innovative, trans-national cultural production, myths of national identity, social change, and the powerful role of popular music in film.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo examina cinco malentendidos comunes sobre la investigación mediante estudios de caso: 1) el conocimiento teórico es más valioso que el conocimiento práctico; 2) no podemos generalizar a partir de un solo caso y, por lo tanto, el estudio de un solo caso no puede contribuir al desarrollo científico; 3) los estudios de caso son más útiles para generar hipótesis, mientras otros métodos son más adecuados para verificar las hipótesis y construir las teorías; 4) el estudio de caso contiene un sesgo hacia la verificación, y 5) suele ser difícil resumir estudios de caso específicos. El artículo explica y corrige estos malentendidos uno por uno y concluye con el principio kuhniano de que una disciplina científica que carece de una elevada cantidad de estudios de caso concienzudamente desarrollados es una disciplina sin producción sistemática de ejemplares, y una disciplina sin ejemplares es una disciplina ineficaz. La ciencia social debe reforzarse mediante la realización de más estudios profundos de caso. /// This article examines five common misunderstandings about case-study research: (1) Theoretical knowledge is more valuable than practical knowledge; (2) One cannot generalize from a single case, therefore the single case study cannot contribute to scientific development; (3) The case study is most useful for generating hypotheses, while other methods are more suitable for hypotheses testing and theory building; (4) The case study contains a bias toward verification; and (5) It is often difficult to summarize specific case studies. The article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and that a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of more good case studies.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P.

Author(s): Murillo Lorena<br>
Abstract: El autor examina cinco equívocos comunes con respecto a la investigatión basada en estudios de caso: 1) el conocimiento teórico es más valioso que el conocimiento práctico; 2) no puede generalizarse a partir de un caso individual y, por tanto, los estudios de caso individuales no pueden contribuir al progreso cientifico; 3) los estudios de caso son más útiles para generar hipótesis, mientras que otros métodos son más apropiados para comprobar hipótesis y elaborar teorías; 4) los estudios de caso tienen un sesgo hacia la verificatión, y 5) a menudo resulta dificil sintetizar los estudios de caso específicos. Flyvbjerg explica y corrige cada uno de estos equívocos, concluyendo con el planteamiento kuhniano de que una disciplina científica carente de estudios de caso cuidadosamente realizados es una disciplina carente de una producción sistemática de ejemplares y, por lo tanto, inefícaz. La ciencia social podria fortalecerse mediante la realización de más y mejores estudios de caso. /// This article examines five common misunderstandings about case-study research: 1) theoretical knowledge is more valuable than practical knowledge; 2) one cannot generalize from a single case, therefore the single case study cannot contribute to scientific development; 3) the case study is most useful for generating hypotheses, while other methods are more suitable for hypotheses testing and theory building; 4) the case study contains a bias toward verification; and 5) it is often difficult to summarize specific case studies.

Author(s): Mische Ann<br>
Abstract: How can we understand the social impact of cognitions of a projected future, taking into account both the institutional determinants of hopes and their personal inventiveness? How can we document the repercussions, often contrary to intentions, "back from" such projected futures to the production and transformation of social structures? These are some of the questions to be addressed by a cultural sociology that attempts to look seriously at the effects of a projected future as a dynamic force undergirding social change. In this essay I discuss some of the reasons why the analysis of the future has been so neglected in sociological theory and research, and then sketch a possible framework for reincorporating it that specifies some of the cognitive dimensions of projectivity. In the process, I will show how a focus on future projections can help us make a link between cognition and action in a manner that has so far been neglected in the sociological literature.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Kosmicki Guillaume<br>
Abstract: Cet article se propose de comprendre le sens musical d'une production de techno dite underground. Au travers de l'analyse de « Let's play » de Crystal Distortion, un artiste réputé de la mouvance free party (ou techno clandestine), on examine principalement la coexistence douloureuse des valeurs utopiques de ce mouvement, aujourd'hui considérablement affaiblies, avec le statut inévitablement commercial du disque sur lequel figure la composition. L'opposition pourrait être frontale, une de ces valeurs premières étant justement le refus de la société marchande, mais on décèle au travers de différentes analyses de nombreuses stratégies pour cacher au mieux l'aspect commercial attelé au morceau. En effet, tout ce qui met une œuvre en situation contribue à son sens, et c'est pourquoi nous consacrons du temps à exposer certains aspects du mouvement acquis par un long travail de terrain et de nombreuses observations participantes : la présentation des valeurs de la free party ; son historique ; la manière dont est considéré Crystal Distortion par les acteurs du mouvement ; ainsi que le fait qu'il vende cette production sur CD (la plupart des productions étant normalement tirées uniquement sur vinyle car destinées au mix par des DJs). Puis nous passons à l'examen des éléments composant la jaquette du CD pour en arriver enfin à l'analyse interne de la production, en relation avec les précédentes strates de l'analyse. The purpose of this paper is to understand the musical meaning of a production of so-called underground techno music. Through the analysis of "Let's play" by Crystal Distortion, a famous artist from the free party trend (or underground techno trend), one examines the painful coexistence of the Utopian values of the movement, tremendously weakened today, with the unavoidable commercial status of the record in which the composition appears. The confrontation could be frontal, as one of these essential values precisely is the refusal of consumer society; but one de~<br>

Author(s): Kululuka Apollinaire Anakesa<br>
Abstract: Depuis la seconde moitié du xxe siècle, il s'opère un jeu de va-et-vient incessant entre le passé et le présent, entre la transcendance de la tradition ou sa rupture, en même temps qu'il se produit un phénomène d'échanges et de communications de diverses musiques du monde. De ce phénomène résultent aussi bien des chocs de culture, de savoirs que de pensées et de leur ré-interprétation ou transformation, sans oublier leur ré-appropriation par les uns et par les autres. Les musiques des uns et des autres -cultures du monde -, devenant alors le patrimoine de tous, se prêtent aux fantasmes et aux interprétations de ceux qui les reçoivent ou les perçoivent selon leur sensibilité, selon leurs affinités. C'est dans ce cadre que la musique elitiste contemporaine couvre actuellement une hétérogénéité de procédés et de formes, en ce qu'elle associe divers facteurs : écriture-oralité, mémoire collective, acquis culturel, juxtaposition ou enchevêtrement d'expressions musicales d'origines diverses (populaires, variétés, traditionnelles, savantes). Ceci appelle sa relecture à différents niveaux, par conséquent sa ré-interprétation, ainsi que l'examen approfondi de ses conditions historiques et socioculturelles de production. Pour amorcer cette nouvelle réflexion sur l'art musical elitiste contemporain, devenue actuellement plus qu'une nécessité, je propose l'expression World Music savante pour servir ici de béquille à une tentative de questionnement sur l'émergence et la consolidation d'une nouvelle identité culturelle ou tradition musicale elitiste contemporaine, celle cristallisant une réalité multiple et hétérogène. C'est aussi, pour moi, une manière de m'interroger sur la contemporanéité de la musique savante actuelle. Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been a ceaseless interplay between past and present, between transcendence of and break with tradition, together with a phenomenon of exchange and communication with diverse musics of the world, resulting in ~<br>

Author(s): Metzger Jean-Luc<br>
Abstract: Cet article propose d'utiliser le concept d'utopie rationnelle pour rendre compte des pratiques managérìales et tout particulièrement de la production de réformes répétées dans les organisations. Dans cette perspective, après avoir décrit une décennie de transformations au sein d'une organisation publique, certaines caractéristiques de la « culture manageriale » sont dégagées de sa pratique réformatrice. Dans un second temps, le concept d'utopie rationnelle est construit à partir de textes canoniques et des travaux d' « utopologues ». Dans un troisième temps, utopie rationnelle et culture manageriale sont comparées, afin de préciser l'apport cognitif de cet outil à la compréhension du fonctionnement des organisations. This article proposes to use the concept of utopia to account for the managerial practices and especially to explain the production of repeated organizational transformations. From this point of view, the case of a decade of ceaseless transformations into a public organization is first described. Some of the features of the « managerial culture » are then inferred from this empirical statement. In the second place, the concept of rational utopia is constructed, from canonical texts and works of « utopologists ». Finally, rational Utopia and managerial culture are compared, in order to specify the main cognitive contributions of this tool to the understanding of organizational functioning.<br>

Abstract: Nous essayons d'éclaircir quelques principes fondamentaux de la grammaire transformationelle de Chomsky à partir de Derrida et de Lacan. Nous tâchons d'approfondir deux problèmes : le premier concerne la portée de ceci que la possibilité de la déviation est donnée comme inhérente à l'institution même de la règle grammaticale; le second a trait au statut et au contenu du tiers sujet en tant que fondement de la structure intersubjective du langage. Primo : Selon Chomsky, une grammaire idéale doit être capable de générer toutes les phrases — et rien que les phrases — bien formées à partir d'un nombre fini de règles. Une grammaire idéale et cohérente ne peut traiter les déviations que comme des possibilités purement accidentelles : une déviation n'aurait pas dû y être; elle n'aurait même pas pu y être. Bref, le risque d'un échec n'est pas interrogé comme prédicat essentiel de la grammaire. À en croire Derrida, on devrait regarder les conséquences qui découlent du fait qu'un risque possible est toujours possible. Comme les déviations présupposent une règle, chaque règle présuppose le risque d'un échec. La possibilité d'un échec est la condition nécessaire d'une règle grammaticale. Mais il s'agit d'une condition très spécifique, puisqu'elle rend impossible cela même qu'elle rend possible. Ni la grammaire, ni la déviation ne sont originaires, mais bien la différance entre les deux, ce qui veut dire qu'à l'origine de la production du sens il n'y a pas une grammaire idéale. Nous avons élaboré cette remarque de Derrida à partir d'une analyse de la métaphore, précisément parce que celle-ci ne peut être intégrée dans un système grammatical préalable. Secundo : la présence implicite d'un sujet compétent chez Chomsky doit expliquer pourquoi le sens ne dépend pas de l'arbitraire d'un sujet empirique. Chaque parole présuppose un Tiers, un Autre qui transcende les positions de destinateur et de destinataire. Mais, pour Chomsky, il s'agit d'un sujet idéal capable de déterminer a prio~<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: Au même titre que toute production ou activité humaines, l'éthique -comprise comme un ensemble de prescriptions et d'interdictions - est pour Claude Lévi-Strauss une manifestation de la fonction symbolique propre à l'esprit humain. Impossible donc, en apparence, de fonder une quelconque morale : car comment pourrait-il y avoir choix éthique, libre préférence, là où il n'y a que nécessité symbolique ? Pourtant, dans un autre aspect de son oeuvre, Lévi-Strauss défend une morale de type rousseauiste : il faut respecter le vivant, jusque dans ses manifestations les plus rudimentaires. Or, cette exigence, il n'arrive pas à la fonder: il ne fait que la postuler. C'est là le signe que Vanthropo-structuralisme de Lévi-Strauss est impuissant à conférer à l'éthique une aire d'intelligibilité propre, en raison de l'assimilation initiale de l'éthique à tout autre système symbolique.<br>

Abstract: Bien que de nombreux auteurs aient fait œuvre à la fois de sociologue et de théologien, il n'existe pas à proprement parler de « sociologie de la théologie ». L'objet de cet article est de proposer une relecture de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs afin de montrer que ce livre offre autant une étude de sociologie de la mémoire qu'une esquisse de sociologie de la théologie. Après avoir précisé en quoi on peut parler d'une étude de la « construction sociale de la pensée chrétienne » chez Halbwachs, on revient plus en détails sur la façon dont il analyse le mécanisme de production de l'orthodoxie théologique, puis sur la spécificité du regard que le sociologue porte sur les questions théologiques. Enfin, la conclusion est l'occasion de souligner ce que pourrait apporter la sociologie de la théologie à la sociologie en elle-même. Even if various authors contributed to sociology as well as to theology, nothing like a "sociology of theology" exists. The aim of this article is to offer a rereading of La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte by Maurice Halbwachs, in order to show that this book is not only a study of sociology of memory but also an outline of a sociology of theology. After having defined in what extent we can find a study of "the social construction of the Christian thought" in Halbwachs' work, we turn to the way he analyses the production process of the theological orthodoxy, and then to the specificity of the sociological point of view on theological questions. Finally, the conclusion gives us the occasion to underline what the sociology of theology could bring to sociology itself. Aunque varios autores han contribuido tanto a la sociología que a la teología, no se puede decir que existe realmente una "sociología de la teología". Este articulo propone una relectura de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs que pretende mostrar que este libro es tanto un estudio~<br>

Abstract: The figuration of "evidenþia" is a rather poorly documented and rarely debated branch of the rhetorical production of images although it is closely connected with the emergence of the notion of "Darstellung" in 18th-century aesthetics. Two features of this proto-aesthetical device will be discussed: The first characteristic is the diagrammatical nature of this figure—examples used are geometrical diagrams or statistical tables rather than pictorial images. The second characteristic is the inherent relation to media translation—the diagrammatic "image" is produced through and "instead of" words and sentences evoking that image. Both aspects underline the relation of the evidential image to language and writing.<br>

Abstract: Le Tessin représente l'unique canton de la Suisse à grande majorité italophone. La construction de l'identité se base essentiellement sur la notion d'« italianité » et sur celle de « helvétidté ». Il s'agit en réalité d'une « double appartenance », et l'article analyse les différents modes de production sociale de l'ambivalence au plan des discours (historiques, linguistiques, folkloriques, politiques, rituels et visuels) et des pratiques sociales correspondantes. The canton Ticino is the unique Swiss canton with Italian-speaking majority. The construction of identity is based essentially on che notions of « italianity » and « swissness » which reveal in fact a « multiple belonging » to Italy and Switzerland. The article analyzes social production of ambivalence in historical, linguistic, folkloric, political, ritual and visual discourses and the corresponding social practices. Der Kanton Tessin ist der einzige Kanton mit italienisch-sprenchender Mehrheit. Die Konstruktion der nationalen Identität beruht hauptsächlich auf den Begriffen von « italianità » und « patria svizzera », was eine multiple italienische und schweizerische Angehörigkeit andeutet. Der Artikel analysiert die verschiedenen Modi von Sozialer Produktion von Ambivalenz in historischen, linguistischen politischen, ritualen und visualen Diskursen und der entsprechenden sozialen Praktiken.<br>

Abstract: The social production of the space appears like creation when elements are demonstrated that originate social relations and that are transformed as well by these relations. The purpose of the present text is to make a series of observations on some of the theoretical dimensions that approach the phenomenon of the territory and the memory through it temporary space in a vision that leaves from the geographic thing for the interdisciplinary thing. La producción social del espacio se presenta como creación cuando se evidencian elementos que originan relaciones sociales y que a su vez son transformados por estas relaciones. La finalidad del presente texto es hacer una serie de observaciones sobre algunas de las dimensiones teóricas que se acercan al fenómeno del territorio y la memoria a través de lo espacio temporal en una visión que parte de lo geográfico a lo interdisciplinar.<br>

Article Title: The conventions of agri-environmental practice in New Zealand: farmers, retail driven audit schemes and a new "spirit of farming"<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40050915<br>

Author(s): Rosin Christopher<br>
Abstract: Audit schemes dictating the parameters of environmentally and socially acceptable management practice have emerged as a pervasive feature of global agri-food production. While the impacts of such schemes on the global movement of food and fibre and the evolving terrains of power in agri-food relations are well documented, the associated reconstruction of farming identities in the localities where audits are implemented has received less attention. The emerging responses to audit schemes in the New Zealand kiwifruit and dairy sectors are key examples of the contentious nature through which auditing is incorporated within farming practice. Analysis of these responses reveals the potential for audits to alter the spirit of farming in New Zealand, initiating new conventions of interaction between producers and industries. Within a convention theory framework, the incorporation of auditing within standard management practice involves a negotiated process in which the farmers employ strategic justifications of their capability (and value) relative to the quality designations established by the audit. Rather than evaluate the relative merits of a farm, its product and its owner through the craft and skill of the independent land manager, successful farming is increasingly associated with the individual's ability to conform to an audit's structures. The global trend toward audit schemes suggests that similar challenges to the spirit of farming may be replicated in other contexts.<br>

Abstract: Se former dans le travail apparaît maintenant comme une part naturelle, évidente de l'activité. Les personnes semblent pouvoir spontanément passer d'une posture de production à une position d'apprenant. Étudier les conditions pour se former dans des univers contraints révèle la nécessité de s'ajuster aux délais de la production et au rythme de la formation. Nous désignons par tempo cet ajustement de l'individu aux contraintes temporelles de la production, lui permettant de saisir dans les situations des occasions d'apprentissage. Les exemples fournis, issus de formations qualifiantes dans l'industrie, en proposent une interprétation croisant les dimensions d'engagement personnel et de transformation de l'activité. The "on the job training" seems for everyone, a natural part of the working activity. People would be able to change their point of view to perform the product target and in the same time the goals of training. This article shows that workers have to play with the time constraints to create by themselves a learning situation. We call "tempo" this capacity to catch in the course of the job, an opportunity to learn. From examples taken in the field of the training within industry, we suggest that this tempo depends on personal involvement in the changing or the activity.<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity o~<br>

Date: 4 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Gross Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The Play About the Baby remains neglected by interpreters of Albee's work because its austerely schematic mode of presentation seems to keeps everything on the surface, making acts of interpretation seem superfluous. Therefore, rather than trying to interpret the play, it is more useful to ask, following the suggestion of Gilles Deleuze, what it does. The play is a dramamachine that produces loss and asserts the centrality of loss to the constitution of selfhood. This loss is achieved by the deployment of perversion, both sexual and linguistic, against Boy and Girl's innocence. The use of perversion ultimately even questions whether there was ever any state of presence that preceded loss. These tactics seem to suggest a wider set of sexual possibilities, but the tactics are ultimately subordinated to the production of melancholia though loss, a subordination that traps the work in a world of severely limited possibilities and encounters.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40059165<br>
Date: 11 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Larkin Craig<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: Alors même qu'ils ne constituent qu'une petite minorité au sein du monde ouvrier et artisanal, les compagnons du Tour de France sont sur-représentés si on les considère du point de vue de la production autobiographique. À partir de ce constat cet article se propose d'examiner les conditions de formation de cette capacité singulière. L'examen de la dizaine d'autobiographies compagnonniques produites depuis le XVIIIe siècle permet ainsi de mettre en relief le fait que le compagnonnage, de par sa formule particulière, met en valeur parmi ses membres ceux qui savent conter, ceux qui savent écrire et ceux qui produisent des chansons. Ces trois types de mises en ordre de la vie et du monde invitent ainsi les compagnons qui en sont les maîtres à penser leur propre existence et, pour quelques-uns, à la mettre en texte. Although forming a tiny minority of workers and craftsmen, the Tour-de-France journeymen are overrepresented in the production of autobiographies. This observation serves as the starting point for examining the conditions underlying this peculiarity. The ten or so autobiographies written since the 18th century are used to show that this apprenticeship, given its specific form, valued those journeymen who knew how to tell stories, write songs or simply write. These three ways of setting life and the world in order led those who master them to conceive of their own existence and, for a few of them, to set it down in writing.<br>

Abstract: This study argues that the exponential growth of divinatory texts variously attributed to ᶜAlī and Jaᶜfar al-Ṣādiq included at the end of Qur'ans produced during the Ṣafavid period provides further evidence for the widespread interest in divination during the tenth/sixteenth and eleventh/seventeenth centuries in Iran. Treatises on 'divination by the Qur'an' (fāl-i Qur'ān) indicate that it was considered permissible to seek guidance by means of holy scripture at this time. On a more symbolic level, fāl-i Qur'āns can be understood as a kind of restoration of the 'defective' ᶜUthmānic codex by re-Shïᶜifying it-if not by reinserting supposedly dropped verses on the ahi al-bayt, then at the very least by adding terminal divinations attributed to the figureheads of Shīᶜī Islam. This particular practice therefore follows general 'Shīᶜification' trends found in a number of cultural and artistic practices of the Ṣafavid period, which also are potentially discernible within the domain of Qur'an production. هذه الدراسة تذهب إلى أن النمو الهائل من النصوص التي تتنبأ بالمستقبل والمنسوبة بأشكال مختلفة لعلي وجعفر الصادق والملحقة بنهاية المصاحف التي أنتجت ﺧﻼﻝ الفترة الصفوية تقدم مزيداﹰ من اﻷدلة على اﻻهتمام واسع النطاق بالعراﻓﺔ في ايران ﺧﻼﻝ القرون / العاشر والحادي عشر السادس عشر / السابع عشر . وتشير المصنفات في الفأل بالقرآن إلى أنه ﺧﻼﻝ تلك الحقبة كان التماس التوجيه من الكتاب المقدس يعتبر أمرا جائزاﹰ. على مستوى أكثر رمزية، فإن فأل القرآن يمكن أن يفهم على أنه معالجة للمصحف العثماني بإعادة " تشييعه " وهذا وإن لم يكن من ﺧﻼﻝ إعادة آيات تتعلق بآل البيت يدعى أنها مسقطة من اﻷصل، فعلى اﻷقل من ﺧﻼﻝ زيادة تنبؤات في آخر المصحف بعد النص القرآني منسوبة لرموز الشيعة. لهذا فإن هذا العمل يتبع توجهات " تشييع " وجدت في عدد من الممارسات الثقافية والفنية في العصر الصفوي يمكن أيضاﹰ ﻣﻼحظتها في إطار إنتاج المصاحف .<br>

Author(s): Adams Julia<br>
Abstract: How did cultural dynamics help bring about the societies we now recognize as modern? This article constructs seven distinct models for how structures of signification and social meaning participated in the transitions to modernity in the West and, in some of the models, across the globe. Our models address: (1) the spread, via imitation, of modern institutions around the world (memetic replication); (2) the construal, by socio-cultural forces and by state organizations, of the modern citizensubject (social subjectification); (3) the continual search for new meanings to replace traditional religious meaning-systems (compensatory reenchantment); (4) repeated attempts, in modern revolutions, to remake society completely, according to a Utopian vision (ideological totalization); (5) the cultural origins and social consequences of scientific and humanistic worldviews (epistemic rift); (6) the gendered politics of state formation (patriarchal supercession); (7) the invention and production of race in the colonial encounter (racial recognition). We explicate the models in reverse chronological order, because in our synthesis, we argue that the original modern break results from a dynamic combination of racial recognition, patriarchal supercession, and epistemic rift; these changes set the stage for the four other processes we theorize. In addition to our synthesis, we also consider, from a more neutral perspective, the kinds of causal arguments upon which these models tend to rely, and thus explicate the analytical undergirding for the application of any of these models to empirical research on transitions to modernity. Throughout the article, we consider how these models might, and might not, mesh with other families of explanation, such as the politico-economic.<br>

Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The article presents the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse (SKAD). SKAD, which has been in the process of development since the middle of the 1990s, is now a widely used framework among social scientists in discourse research in the German-speaking area. It links arguments from the social constructionist tradition, following Berger and Luckmann, with assumptions based in symbolic interactionism, hermeneutic sociology of knowledge, and the concepts of Michel Foucault. It argues thereby for a consistent theoretical and methodological grounding of a genuine social sciences perspective on discourse interested in the social production, circulation and transformation of knowledge, that is in social relations and politics of knowledge in the so-called 'knowledge societies'. Distancing itself from Critical Discourse Analysis, Linguistics, Ethnomethodology inspired discourse analysis and the Analysis of Hegemonies, following Laclau and Mouffe, SKAD's framework has been built up around research questions and concerns located in the social sciences, referring to public discourse and arenas as well as to more specific fields of (scientific, religious, etc.) discursive struggles and controversies around "problematizations" (Foucault).<br>

Abstract: This paper is about the analysis of the written production of argumentative discourse. Thanks to the technique of collective writing it is possible to observe the process of discourse production. Declarative, strategic and procedural abilities of two non native adults are successively analyzed and compared periodically to those of two young native speakers. This study focuses on only two levels : global and interphrasal organisation of discourse. The organisation of debates in class so as to bring students to build argumentative concepts and help them in their approach of texts (reading and writing) shows the limits of a didactic scheme which relies on oral language practice for the elaboration of written texts.<br>

Trata-se de pontuar, neste processo, o que está verdadeiramente em jogo, ou seja, o ato de configuração e reconfiguração do tempo que encerra a ação interpretativa em Antropologia. This article brings a reflections about the ethnographic method while encapsulating the identity theme describes by the anthropologist, in special, focusing the moral-ethic problem of the searching of the internal coherence of its ethnographic production through the study of the process of the anthropologic knowledge construction. It is to point, in this process, that is really in the play, or, the act of configuration and reconfiguration of time that stops the interpretative action in anthropology.<br>

Abstract: This article challenges the assumption that "tradition" is a quality pertaining chiefly to objects, stylistic conventions, or the use of materials. Equally, it refutes the notion that tradition is merely the perpetuation of ritualized practices or skilled techniques. By considering the complex relation between vocational migration, heritage, and identity among contemporary fine woodworkers at London's Building Crafts College, it argues that tradition is a state of mind — a recurring nostalgia for an idealized past, or the desire for a Utopian future. More specifically, the article investigates a "tradition of longing" for engagement in nonalienating modes of production, aesthetic work, and an authentic way of living.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude s'interroge sur la question du mal dans la philosophie de Paul Ricœur. En prenant pour objet le développement de sa réflexion sur cette question depuis le début de son œuvre philosophique jusqu'à sa dernière période, l'auteur tente de comprendre la manière dont Ricœur rend compte de ce phénomène en examinant trois axes majeurs dans la confrontation au mal : la compréhension pratique du mal (phronesis-mimesis-praxis), l'élaboration d'une réponse au problème (catharsis-Durcharbeitung), le pardon. This study examines the question of evil in the philosophy of Paul Ricœur. In interpreting the development of his reflection on this question from the beginning of his philosophical production until his final period, the author attempts to comprehend the way in which Ricœur accounts for this phenomenon in analyzing three major ways of approach to evil: a) practical understanding (phronesis-mimesis-praxis), b) working-through (catharsis-Durcharbeitung), and c) pardon.<br>

Abstract: Causal explanations of social actions are central to modern as well as to classic sociology. Even in its revised form. the most influential causal theory -- the covering law theory -- has not proved particularly fruitful for the study of social action. But there are alternative and potentially more fruitful theories. This article presents Weber's methodology and critical realism as two different contributions to a generative view of causality in social science which both try to transcend the protracted controversy between a hermeneutic interpretive sociology and a positivistic causal-explanatory sociology. From the generative standpoint. causal explanations are directed not towards the production of empirical correlations between variables or towards the making of predictions on the basis of empirical laws, but towards the uncovering of causal properties and the processes whereby social actions arise out of the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions. meanings. intentions. social contexts and structures.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the analysis of culture and mass communication should be regarded as central concerns of sociology and social theory. It develops a framework for the analysis of culture and shows how this framework can be applied to the study of mass communication. Focusing on the medium of television, the paper highlights some of the distinctive characteristics of mass communication and examines some of the factors involved in the production, construction and reception of media messages. It is argued that this approach enables the analyst to pose questions concerning the ideological character of mass communication in a new and more fruitful way.<br>

Abstract: The public/private debate has not been a major feature in recent sociological theory. However; Bailey (2000) has argued for a renewed sociological research programme to focus on the sociological private. He outlines three dimensions of this: intimate relationships, the self and the unconscious. This article seeks to address two of these dimensions, the production of self-theories and unconscious disavowal. We extend this theorizing to account for the experience of sexual engagement present a discourse analysis of the diaries of the comedian and actor Kenneth Williams (1928-1988). Drawing principally on the thought of Merleau-Ponty (1962) we argue that our analysis demonstrates the importance of a prereflective engagement with the social world that is then reflected on in internal dialogue. We show how discourse analysis may be used to demonstrate the discursive production of a self-theory and the role of such a self-theory in the disavowal of the principal's pre-reflective engagement with others.<br>

Author(s): WODAK RUTH<br>
Abstract: The concept of the nation as an imagined community has gained importance in the relevant literature during the last decade. How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? These questions were investigated in our study on the Austrian nation and identity. Taking several current social scientific approaches as our point of departure, we have developed a method of description and analysis of these phenomena which has applications beyond the discursive production of national identity in the specific Austrian example studied. By focusing particularly on the discursive construction of (national) sameness, this study has broken new ground in discourse-historical analysis, which until now has mainly been concerned with the analysis of the discursive construction of difference.<br>

Abstract: À la suite d'un désaccord avec la théorie des contrats de lecture exposée dans Le Pacte autobiographique de Philippe Lejeune, Serge Doubrovsky crée un terme qui fait boule de neige, l'autofiction, désignation qui lui permet de camper sa production littéraire dans une nouvelle famille de textes. Les auteurs qui se réclament de cette singulière appellation générique proclament la représentativité du discours comme un obstacle à l'expression du réel, et illustrent du même coup l'aporie du projet autobiographique. À notre avis, il s'agit d'un faux problème, puisque depuis toujours les autobiographes ont été conscients d'utiliser les mécanismes de fiction pour énoncer le vrai. Dans cet article, nous tentons de démontrer, à partir du corpus québécois, qu'au-delà de la stylistique littéraire, les pratiques ritualisées des informations péritextuelles renversent le désenchantement autobiographique et donnent raison à l'approche pragmatique de Lejeune.<br>

Abstract: Deux tendances radicalement différentes semblent se partager la production historiographique médiévale. L'une, inaugurée par l'Histoire ecclésiastique d'Eusèbe et dominée par les réflexions que lui a consacrées saint Augustin (et de loin la plus importante), s'attache à retracer le destin des hommes appelés à se rassembler au sein de l'Église afin d'être portés vers un avenir qui doit leur permettre de sortir de l'histoire et de se retrouver à la fin des temps au sein de la Cité de Dieu. L'autre, renouant avec la tradition antique rejetée par l'historiographie chrétienne, se consacre à une communauté définie qu'elle pourvoit d'une origine et d'un passé qui fondent son identité et son existence présente, mais qui semblent en même temps constamment menacées par la fiction. Après avoir rappelé le point de vue de saint Augustin, et afin de mettre en lumière cette double orientation, cette étude s'appuie principalement sur l'historiographie des îles britanniques : à l'Histoire ecclésiastique du peuple anglais de Bède répond en effet l'Histoire des rois de Bretagne de Geoffroy de Monmouth. La critique adressée à ce dernier par Guillaume de Newburgh au seuil de son Histoire des choses anglaises, s'en prenant au caractère fictif des événements attribués au roi Arthur et aux prophéties de Merlin, éclaire de manière exemplaire le sens de l'opposition entre une histoire devant aboutir au ciel et celle qui trouve son assise sur la terre. Two conceptions, radically different, seem to share the medieval historiography. The first (and far most important) one, initiated by Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History and dominated by the reflections saint Augustine has devoted to it, recalls the destiny of human beings who should put themselves together under the conduct of the Church, in the expectation of a future which will allow them to get out of History and find themselves at the End of Times inside the City of God. The other one, linked to the tradition produced in Antiquity but rejecte~<br>

Abstract: Selon la philosophie moderne la pensée est une production de la subjectivité, la volonté est une auto-détermination et le temps est une auto-affection. Kierkegaard offre une autre compréhension de la vie volontaire en envisageant une volonté brisée par le prochain, par le temps et par Dieu. La patience n'est pas pour Kierkegaard un accident de notre caractère, mais la condition pour devenir une personne. Cela suppose de laisser de côté toute compréhension purement psychologique de la patience. La vraie persévérance s'oppose totalement à l'obsession de se blinder par rapport au monde. Entre l'endurance stoïcienne et la patience chrétienne comme patience dans l'espérance il n'y a pas d'essence commune. Kierkegaard montre que la patience de l'amour est une passivité qui est la voie du salut. For modem philosophy meaning is a product of subjectivity, will is a self-determination, and time is a self-affection. Kierkegaard gives us another meaning for a voluntary life by considering desire that is broken by the will of another man, time and God. Patience is not for Kierkegaard an accident of character but is the condition to becoming a person. It is necessary to ignore a purely psychological understanding of patience. True perseverance is radically opposed to an obsessive existence blinded to the world. Between the stoic conception of endurance and Christian patience there is no common essence. For Kierkegaard, the patience of love is a form of passivity that can save Mankind.<br>

Author(s): Favereau Olivier<br>
Abstract: Les "institutions", comme ensemble préexistant et objectivable de ressources de justification, forment le milieu où puisent les agents économiques, pour gérer leurs problèmes de coordination et/ou leurs conflits de reproduction. Les "conventions" sont des représentations collectives de "monde commun justifié", qui activent les institutions, et légitiment les arrangements locaux, au sein des "organisations", dont la production conjointe de marchandises et de règles va reconstituer ou dégrader le milieu institutionnel de départ. Ce modèle conventionnaliste à trois termes cherche à surmonter les difficultés des autres analyses économiques des institutions. Il pose un agent économique rompu aux défauts de coordination et de reproduction, et impensable hors d'un milieu institutionnel composé au minimum du langage, de la monnaie, et du droit. La pluralité des logiques de justification fonde la diversité empirique des institutions. La dynamique des institutions est étudiée à travers les opérateurs qui font et défont les possibilités de "monde commun" à partir de la "pluralité" : la "concurrence" dans l'espace des prix doit être combinée avec la "critique" dans l'espace des valeurs (normes). L'analyse conventionnaliste du capitalisme remet le projet de Marx à l'endroit en déduisant la théorie de l'exploitation d'une théorie de la justice, plutôt que l'inverse. "Institutions", as a set of pre-existing and objective resources of justification, is the milieu where economic agents can find materials to solve their coordination problems and/or their conflicts of reproduction. "Conventions" are collective representations of "justified common worlds" that activate institutions and legitimise arrangements within "organisations", whose joint production of goods and rules will lead to the renewal -or the degeneracy- of prior institutional milieu. This "three terms conventionalist model" endeavors to face the difficulties encountered by the other economic approaches of institutions. I~<br>

Abstract: S'appuyant sur l'histoire électorale française, l'article tend à établir que l'appréhension traditionnelle de la notion de compétence politique autonomise par trop cette dernière d'autres matrices sociales, culturelles ou religieuses qui contribuent pourtant à forger l'Opinion que se font les citoyens au moment des élections. Parce qu'il privilégie l'échelle des acteurs et celle des communautés locales, parce qu'il partage le souci de restituer les logiques de mobilisation et de participation électorales, et donc de retrouver les formes différenciées de politisation(s) des citoyens, le regard socio-historique favorise le renouvellement des paradigmes susceptibles de rendre compte des mécanismes de production sociale de la compétence à opiner « politiquement ». Au paradigme de la domination privilégié, on associera ici celui de la « traduction » susceptible de penser la politisation en termes d'échanges et de transferts culturels. Based on French electoral history, the article tends to establish that the traditional apprehension of the notion of political competence exaggerates its autonomy from the other social, cultural or religious matrices which contribute to forging citizens' opinions at the time of the elections. Because it privileges the level of the actors and that of the local communities, because it shares the concern to restore the logics of mobilization and electoral turnout, and thus to find the various familiar forms of politicization of the citizens, the socio-historical approach facilitates the renewal of paradigms able to account for the mechanisms of social production of « political » beliefs. To the paradigm of privileged domination, we associate that of the « translation » making it possible to account for politicization in terms of exchanges and cultural transfers.<br>

Abstract: Depuis une vingtaine d'années, la notion d'identité a été de plus en plus fréquemment utilisée dans des travaux portant sur la musique, sans que le sens qui lui est donné et les fonctions qui lui sont attribuées soient toujours précisément définis. Cet article voudrait contribuer à clarifier les rapports qu'entretiennent musique et configuration identitaire. Sur la base de travaux portant tant sur la théorie des identités que sur les identités en musique, il suggère que les significations sociales, donc identitaires, de la musique doivent être appréhendées dans les relations entre production, réception et matière musicale elle-même. La musique n'étant pas un langage mais un système symbolique aux interprétants infinis, elle est susceptible d'un grand nombre d'interprétations variables selon les situations et les enjeux; son utilisation en politique suppose par conséquent des opérations de façonnage spécifiques. For the past twenty years, studies of music have used more and more frequently the notion of identity. Yet the meanings given to "identity" in these studies, and the functions ascribed to it, have not always been precisely defined. This paper tries to clarify the relationship between music and identity configurations. Based on studies dealing with the theory of identity and with musical identities, it suggests that the social significations of music -identitarian significations included - must be understood as resulting from the intertwining of production, reception and the musical object itself. Music is not a language, but a symbolical system whose interprétants are infinite, it can consequently generate many diverse interpretations, which vary according to situations and stakes, and it needs to be specifically fashioned to be put to political uses.<br>

Abstract: From the very beginning of his career as a writer, Nikolay Ostrovsky (1904-36) received hostile criticisms of his style, which was described as 'coarse,' and which led some observers to conclude that his success was due more to his prowess as a soldier than to his talents as a writer. But his success was incontrovertible. Readers rushed to buy his book How the Steel Was Tempered, despite the absence of publicity when it appeared. What accounts for the extraordinary success? Readers' letters contained in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI) can help us answer this question. Over the past ten years there have been many studies in which scholars have sought the organizational basis of socialist realism as an esthetic, putting the literariness of the work before its political character. It certainly seems logical, since esthetics is not just a question of production but also of consumption (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), that this program of research should also include the acceptance of the texts, their reception by the readers. Сначала своей писательской карьеры, Николай Островский (1904-1936) получил строгие критики за свой стиль, который был описан как «груб» и некоторые наблюдатели считали, что успех его был обязан больше его подвигам в качестве солдата чем его талантам писателя. Но успех был бесспорен. Читатели устремлялись чтобы покупать книгу, Как закалялась сталь, несмотря на отсутствие рекламной шумихи во время ее публикации. Что может объяснить этот чрезвычайный успех? Письма читателей, содержавшиеся в Государственных архивах искусства и литературы Федерации России (RGALI) могут нам помочь отвечать на этот вопрос. В течение последних десяти лет, многочисленные публикации показали структуру социалистического реализма, как эстетика, помещающая литературность произведения перед его политическим характером. Потому что эстетика не только вопрос продукции а также потребления (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), кажется логическим, чтобы эта исследовательская программа ~<br>

Abstract: In sixteenth-century France, the triumphal entry was closely tied to the notion of collective memory. This article defines the concept of collective memory as it is articulated in sixteenth-century texts, retraces the history of the relationship between this notion and the triumphal entry, and, in analyzing several texts tied to entry ceremonies, explores how such texts address triumphal entries' role in the production of collective memory—as opposed to its preservation, which is the typical focus in discussions of the relationship between collective memory and historiographical or poetic works during this period.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to explore the continuing relevance of Nietzsche's genealogical analysis of Western rationality to the sociology of knowledge. While Nietzsche is often neglected in classical sociological theory textbooks, this paper argues that Nietzsche has a very significant contribution to sociological theory especially in the field of knowledge production. Recent sociologists are now acknowledging this tradition. Hence this paper discusses how the basic tenets of Nietzsche's critique of Western metaphysics and positivism can be harnessed to create a powerful critique of contemporary sociological understanding of knowledge construction and its legitimation in society. Some of these themes are discussed at the end of the paper especially in relation to Philippine sociology.<br>

Abstract: Délibérément inscrit dans une perspective micrologique, les analyses présentées dans cet article interrogent l'actualisation de la mémoire individuelle sur son versant situationnel, à partir d'une enquête de terrain réalisée auprès de la population pied-noire dans le milieu des Pieds-Noirs. L'objectif de ce texte consiste à mettre au jour une partie du travail permanent d'appropriation et de reformulation de la mémoire ; un processus qui prend forme dans le détail des interactions ordinaires de la vie quotidienne. L'examen des données recueillies dans différents contextes micro-sociaux privés montre comment des éléments, sinon vrais, du moins plausibles, se maintiennent, sont réévalués ou introduits dans la mémoire individuelle. L'actualisation des cadres et contenus mnésiques, à la fois reconduits et amendés au gré d'échanges banals, obéit donc aux dynamiques propres aux interactions ordinaires, qui à ce titre, apparaissent comme des sources relativement autonomes de la « petite production mnésique ». Based on a fieldwork among the French "Pieds-Noirs," this article analyses through a "micro" perspective the enactment of individual memory in concrete situations. Its aim is to decipher elements of the everyday processes of appropriation and reformulation of memory, as it takes place in ordinary interactions. The analysis of these interactions observed in very detailed settings shows how elements that are at least believable (if not "true") are produced, maintained, reevaluated and cast in one's memory. The actualization of those frames and contents of memory seems eventually to follow the modalities of banal interactions, which can hence be considered as relatively autonomous source of the "small production of memory".<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo estudia la expansión de las tecnologías digitales en el mercado audiovisual del Perú, una de las economías emergentes de Sudamérica. Se argumenta que el arribo al Perú del video CD y del DVD propició el incremento exponencial de la piratería de productos audiovisuales y, a la vez, el desarrollo de una industria de videos controlada por sectores sociales populares, ajenos a la institucionalidad empresarial, cultural y política dominante. La base productiva de esta última está compuesta por microempresas formales dedicadas a la grabación y venta de videos orientados a segmentos de bajos ingresos en base a contenidos locales. La distribución, por su parte, es realizada principalmente a través de redes de piratería. El perfil de esta industria evidencia las tecnologías digitales facilitan la democratización de la producción, comercialización y consumo de imágenes, la ampliación de oportunidades para la circulación de contenidos audiovisuales distintos al gusto y canon euronorteamericano y la aparición de modelos de negocio abiertos que no dependen de los derechos de autor para acumular capital. Este artículo está estructurado en cinco partes. En las cuatro primeras analizamos el origen, cadena de valor, productos y modelos de negocio de la industria de videos. La última parte explica el fracaso de la lucha emprendida por el Estado contra la piratería y propone como alternativa promover economías lícitas a través de políticas culturales basadas en sistemas de información y financiamiento, así como en el equilibrio entre los derechos de autor y los derechos del consumidor. This article studies the expansion of digital technologies in Peru, one of the emerging economies of South America. I suggest that the arrival of VCD and DVD technologies has provoked a rampant increase of audiovisual piracy and, at the same time, the development of a video industry controlled by a popular social sector separate from mainstream institutions.

Publisher: Sameeksha Trust<br>
Issue: i402288<br>
Date: 4 26, 1968<br>
Author(s): Cohn Lata<br>
Abstract: Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author does a reading of the narratives concerning Guatemalan Indian Rigoberta Menchú, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992. The first part analyzes the way in which oral history turns to binary relations like public and private or text and context. In the second part, Claudia de Urna Costa concentrates on problems arising in the production and translation of cultural diversities and once again reinforces binary oppositions like the First and Third Worlds. L'auteur fait une lecture des narratives sur Rigoberta Menchú, indienne guatémaitèque, Prix Nobel de la Paix en 1992. Dans la première partie de l'article, Claudia de Lima Costa analyse la façon par laquelle l'histoire orale se tourne vers les relations binaires telles que publique et privé, texte et contexte. Dans la deuxième partie, elle s'Interroge sur les problèmes de production et traduction des diversités culturelles et, à nouveau, renforce les oppositions binaires comme Premier et Tiers-Monde.<br>

Abstract: Pour expliquer le suicide des agriculteurs, les médias se limitent généralement au seul facteur économique. Une approche comprehensive de cette question révèle d'autres conditions objectives de production de ce qu'on peut appeler la « souffrance sociale ». Le déséquilibre structurel entre l'organisation prescrite et l'organisation réelle du travail génère chez les agriculteurs un sentiment de pénibilité mentale. Tenus de répondre à des impératifs d'autonomie et de réalisation de soi, ces derniers ne disposent pas tous des mêmes ressources sociales pour parvenir à une image positive d'eux-mêmes. Pour se développer, la souffrance suicidaire s'appuie en effet sur la distribution inégale du capital économique, culturel et d'autochtonie. When explaining suicide among farmers, the media tend to focus exclusively on economic factors. This paper argues that adopting a more comprehensive approach to the issue highlights other conditions of production of what might be termed "social suffering". It is suggested that the structural imbalance between the prescribed and actual organization of work causes mental pain among farmers. The paper argues that amid increasing pressure to demonstrate greater autonomy and self-realization, farmers may not have the same social resources for developing a positive self-image. Research shows that an unequal distribution of economic and cultural capital and capital of autochtony leads to increased suicidal thoughts.<br>

Abstract: Issu des recherches d'une quinzaine d'exégètes, cet ouvrage, de style universitaire, est destiné à présenter à un large public un panorama des recherches johanniques contemporaines. Très diversifié quant aux thèmes abordés, il introduira lectrices et lecteurs aux questions irrésolues que pose l'histoire des communautés johanniques et de leur production littéraire. De nombreux auteurs s'interrogent sur la signification des relectures et des retouches successives. Ainsi, l'ouvrage rejoint l'aspect le plus énigmatique du corpus johannique (évangile et épîtres). Les écrits johanniques ont été dès l'origine et demeurent au centre de conflits d'interprétations; de ces conflits, comme des hypothèses les plus diverses, le livre a le mérite de rendre compte. Ainsi, il se montre digne de figurer parmi les ouvrages de référence sur ce sujet. This collection, the work of fifteen exegetes and edited by Kaestli, Poffet and Zumstein, presents a panorama of contemporary Johannine research for the benefit of the larger public. Touching upon many themes, it introduces the reader to the unresolved questions concerning the Johannine communities and their literature. Several authors question the significance of rereadings and successive alterations, the most enigmatic aspect of the Johannine corpus (gospel and epistles). The collection has the merit of presenting the diverse hypothesis and conflicts of interpretation to which Johannine writings have always been exposed, and should figure amongst the works of reference on the subject.<br>

Author(s): Zharova James V.<br>
Abstract: An approach to sociocultural analysis based on the ideas of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and others is used to provide the foundation for discussing narratives as "cultural tools." The production of official, state sponsored historical narratives is examined from this perspective, and it is argued that this production process may be shaped as much by dialogic encounters with other narratives as by archival information. These claims are harnessed to examine the production of post-Soviet Russian history textbooks, especially their presentation of the events surrounding the Russian Civil War of 1918-20.<br>

Author(s): White Michael<br>
Abstract: Using a broadly Aristotelian framework I propose poetic form as a means for distinguishing historicities. I analyze Sakalava performances of possession by royal ancestors as the creative production of a kind of history, distinguish it from a dominant occidental model of history, and elaborate the chronotope on which it is based and the heteroglossia and historical consciousness it enables. I argue that Sakalava spirit possession has a strongly realist bent and suggest the interest of poiesis for anthropological analysis and comparison more generally.

Abstract: To date, little is known about when and to what degree science students begin to participate in authentic scientific graphing practices. This article presents the results of a series of studies on the production, transformation, and interpretation of graphical representation from Grade 8 to professional scientific practice both in formal testing situations (inside) and in the course of field/laboratory work (outside). The results of these studies can be grouped into two major areas. First, there is a discontinuity in the graph-related practices that marks a boundary between people who engage in work that requires them to transform data into graphical representations (converted) and people who do not have such experiences (cannibals). Second, the didactic practices of high school textbooks and university lectures exhibit a marked discontinuity relative to graphing practices in scientific journals. Graphs used in didactic circumstances may be associated with students' difficulties in interpreting "real data." It appears that school teachers and university professors (missionaries) do little to put their students on trajectories of increasing participation in authentic scientific graphing practices.<br>

Abstract: Summary: On the Relations between the Sociology and the Semiology of Music. The aim of this article is to inquire what relations are possible between the semiology and the sociology of music. The first section attempts a definition of semiology: it may be understood as the science of signs, as the use of linguistic models in the description of non-linguistic fields, or as a programme of research specific to the humanities and the social sciences which distinguishes between the aspects of production, reception and the immanence of the meaning in question. The second section, through a critical analysis of a text by Barthes, explores the question of whether semiology can be understood as the science of musical ideologies. It demonstrates that semiology has no specific methodology with which to meet these problems. The third section investigates the possibility of using semiology to assist in reconciling musical and social structures. After briefly recalling several positions on this subject, we suggest that the 'neutral level' of description, presented above as one of the elements of semiological analysis, can serve as a necessary preliminary to the harmonising of musical with social structures.<br>

Gardant au fond de l'espoir, l'auteure conclut l'article en présentant le protocole d'appropriation culturelle recommandé par des universitaires autochtones lors de l'utilisation de savoirs autochtones par des personnes nonautochtones dans des contextes pédagogiques.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes “Rotología del poroto” by Pablo de Rokha. Our contention states that the bean works as a multiple and complex metaphor, allowing the poetic voice to refer to the nation, the working-class subjects and the political project of the revolution. Each of these categories takes place in a production context marked by the presence of the hacienda and the Cold War scenario. Additionally, the article analyzes how the poem, at the time of enunciation by the speaker, builds a counterpoint between the Chile of yesterday and today to articulate a social protest speech in favor of the working-class subjects of the national community.<br>

Actions and artful representation indicate, respectively, proximity to reality, from near to far—a difference that outlines a space for aesthetic production. I argue that retablos contribute to an aesthetic that orients the senses and the mind against oppressive conditions and toward a positive vision of what the world might be.<br>

Abstract: Ruben Borg's
         The Measureless Time of Joyce, Deleuze and Derridaargues that James Joyce'sFinnegans Wakemust be read as a singular attempt to represent the eccentric structure of post-human temporality. The book relocates theWakewithin a long history of philosophies of time as well as recent post-structuralist and information theory. Drawing upon the work of Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Derrida, Borg shows how Joyce's formal and narratological innovations enabled him to present a structure of time that does not obey the linear, humanistic progression of thebildungsromanbut instead manifests mechanical temporal economies of production and waste.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Jean Hatzfeld's
         Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak, a collection of testimonials by perpetrators of the genocide in Rwanda. While surveying popular representations of killers in Rwanda, circulating theories about the 1994 genocide and the veracity of these killers' accounts, this article also investigates the production, edition, and translation of these killers' interviews. In particular, it focuses on Jean Hatzfeld's role as editor of these killers' testimonies and Innocent Rwililiza's position as translatorinterviewer. Contextualizing elements missing from these interviews——namely, concepts from Rwandan language, history, and culture, as well as broader psychosocial dimensions both pre- and post-genocide——this article problematizes Hatzfeld's depiction of these ““ordinary killers.””<br>

Abstract: It is not new for poets to renovate the language of poetry by appropriating or sending up enervated, devalued language as a way to critique discourses of power. It may even be one of the oldest methods of literary innovation, considering the Roman appropriation of Greek literature. But some contemporary, experimental poets explicitly link mass production of capitalist consumer products and the logic of the copy
         
               to the production of art in a Benjaminian vein. De la Torre refers to the age of mechanical reproduction in an epigraph to “Photos While U Wait,” which she borrows from Jacques Barzun's introduction to Gustave Flaubert's110
            Dictionary of Accepted Ideas: “The cliché, as its name indicates, is the metal plate that reproduces the same image mechanically without end.”
               Poems written under constraint and composed of recombined, appropriated text at times thematize the activity of appropriation itself as endemic to capitalism. The supermarket is a popular trope for the destruction of authenticity, disenfranchisement, and advertising's interpellation of the subject. A discursive tone dotted with imperatives mark these poems, as they echo the language of consumerism. African American poet Harryette Mullen's111
            S*PeRM**K*T, included in herRecyclopedia, is structured according to the logic of supermarket aisles (“sort of like your shopping list”), and the missing letters in its title spell outu are, as in, “you are what you eat,” as Mullen explains in an author's note. “I was thinking about domestication, about the role of women, women as consumers, women having supposed power as consumers but also being disempowered in other ways…. You can't necessarily buy who you really want to be. You have to buy the available images,” she writes in an accompanying statement.
               Mullen, like Hayes, also connects her poetics to that of a woman poet predecessor. Her books112

Abstract: The effect of the imitation of action in tragedy is that the audience experiences an immediate emotional thrill in the form of “pity and fear” through which the whole experience is purified in catharsis. Gerald Else argues in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat catharsis “belongs to Aristotle's defense of the emotional side of poetry against Plato. The arousing of pity and fear is an integral part of the work of tragedy, at least, and something about that production is such that those feelings are, or can be made, beneficent rather than hurtful” (6–7).<br>

Abstract: Newman divides Africa into six regions: Northern Africa, Ethiopia and the Horn, Western Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa. Nowhere in his text does he introduce the continental polemic of a European North Africa as opposed to sub-Saharan Africa. In the theoretical chapters at the beginning of his text, he lays out the possible structures of the overlapping of regions in various terms of subsistence (for example, hunting and gathering, agriculture, short- and long-distance trade, and linguistic structures). He is also careful to note the influx of non-continental Africans into the peopling of Africa as in the case of Jews, Muslims, and Christians in the fifteenth century. The continual influx of European peoples and practices radically changed the course of peopling of African cultures. This influx had a deleterious effect upon the demography through the slave trade as well as a radical change and diminution of modes of life and subsistence through the introduction of mercantile and capitalistic modes of production.<br>

Abstract: Or take an example from ancient physics (2400 B.P.), Democritean atoms. Democritus theorized bits of matter so small
            in factbut alsoin principleto be too small to be humanly perceived. Yet he went on to hypothesize that their shapes werecausesof our perceptions. Thus smooth round shapes caused sweet tastes, while barbed ones caused bitter. From today's technologically embodied science we have now overcome his limitations with scanning, tunneling electronic microscopes and now know, recently, that two-atom-thick carbon films can be arranged into thirteen different multistable forms through imaging of the atoms. Thus, using the vocabulary of modernist realism, we could conclude that Democritean atoms never existed, or using the vocabulary of social constructionism, we could say that the ancient “scientific objects—Democritus's atoms” have disappeared to be replaced in the nineteenth century by Rutherfordian mini–solar system atoms and today again replaced by quantum structures. Or we could turn postphenomenological and note that through improved new instrumental technologies, we can now mediatedly “see” the carbon structures noted. What has changed with both Democritus and Rutherford are lifeworlds in which objects, knowledge production, and human–world interrelationships have been superseded.<br>

Abstract: Such vulnerability to assault raises questions of ethics that are central to the next section, entitled “Ethics and Reciprocity in Heidegger and Beauvoir.” Julie Kuhlken's article, “Heidegger and Aristotle: Action, Production, and Ethos,” considers Heidegger's practical philosophy, as expressed in his “Letter on Humanism,” in relation to his lectures on Aristotle from the 1920s. Through a discussion of Heidegger's distinctions between action and effecting and between ethics and ethos, Kuhlken argues that Heidegger's practical philosophy focuses less on ethics as it is typically understood today and more on the ancient notion of the good life. In “The Other (Woman): Limits of Knowledge in Beauvoir's Ethics of Reciprocity,” Ellie Anderson reassesses Beauvoir's ethics of reciprocity through a reading of her 1943 novel
      She Came to Stay. Anderson argues, against prominent readers of Beauvoir such as Penelope Deutscher and Debra Bergoffen, that central to Beauvoir's ethics is the recognition of the irreducible otherness or radical alterity of the other—and thus of a fundamental epistemic gap between self and other.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not envision so explicit an invitation (or even exhortation) to action. Rather he insists on understanding how poetic or fictional texts refer to the world outside of language. In a significant move, Ricoeur rejects the false choice between conceiving of a text as either a transparent window into conscious authorial intention or as a closed, self-referential world. His approach instead treats authorship as one textual influence among many. Ricoeur says that his formulation of refiguration “is part of a hermeneutics that aims less at restoring the author's intention behind the text than at making explicit the movement by which the text unfolds, as it were, a world in front of itself” (1984, 1:81). Here Ricoeur directly engages the poststructuralist critique of authorial intention and textual reference. Yet he offers an insightful and sensible alternative to the idea that texts should be understood primarily as effects of language.
         
               Like Ricoeur, I see authorial/creative intention as an important aspect of reading texts of public memory that is nonetheless only part of the broader context of textual production and address. The intentions of creators leave indelible marks on the texts and thus on the public memories they disseminate. But many other factors affect the nature of a text, and Ricoeur's approach emphasizes that reality.12<br>

Abstract: The resonance of Shaw's perspectives on health deepens in his later writings, from
      Back to Methuselah(1921) andThe Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism(1928) toDoctors' Delusions(1932) andFarfetched Fables(1948–50). In them, with an eye toward collective wellness, progressive growth, and enduring fitness, he promulgates interrelated theories of metabiology, socialism, despotism, and evolution. His constellation of superabundant vitality, political and metaphysical sensibilities, and practices of diet, exercise, and dress evokes a Victorian construction of healthiness, understood, according to historian Bruce Haley, as “a state of constitutional growth and development in which the bodily systems and mental faculties interoperate harmoniously under the direct motive power of vital energy or the indirect motive power of the moral will, or both. Its signs are, subjectively recognized, a sense of wholeness and unencumbered capability, and, externally recognized, the production of useful, creative labor.”
            For many at the time,18
         mens sana in corpore sanoconceptualized the healthy body as a vivarium for intellectual and moral growth while others were more radically materialist in positing happiness and good living as dependent upon the physiological self. In any case, as Haley maintains, the “practice of analogically or metaphorically connecting [spiritual health and bodily health] was habitual in Victorian epistemology[,] … the ideal of personal health a way of grasping the proper relation between the self as a whole … and the unity of moral and physical laws which transcend the self.”
            If consistent with their yoking of vivacity, integrity, and volition, Shaw flipped the hierarchy that privileged the corporeal, figuring the intellectual will as the unifying and driving force in health; in his words, “it is the mind that makes the body and not the body the mind.”19

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: To further establish the common chords in Plato and Marcuse, there is Socrates's analogy of rhetoric to painting, a comparison that is compatible with Marcuse's and Bloch's emphasis on artistic production. Specifically, Socrates is speaking of rhetoric in the media of writing. He says, “You know, Phaedrus, that's the strange thing about writing, which makes it truly analogous to painting. The painter's products stand before us as though they were alive, but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence.”
      
               Even the setting of the dialogue reverberates with utopian concepts. Socrates and Phaedrus walk outside the city walls in a kind of nowhere to have this dialectical conversation about rhetoric, the function of which is actual progress inside the walls of Athens. In this same way, Marcuse's utopian function for the arts refers to a forgotten and repressed good in the city, one that can only be nourished for material growth through nonmaterial, symbolic communication and persuasion in transcendent goodwill.31<br>

Issue: bullamerschoorie.issue-372<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of an Iron Age I dwelling at the Phoenician site of Dor, on Israel's Carmel coast. We provide a definition for the architectural mental template for this type of house—a Central Courtyard Hash-Plan House. By combining an analysis of the size and layout of the house, and the distribution of artifacts and ecofacts in it, we define rooms devoted to specialized economic activities such as food production and storage and also attempt to identify gendered spaces. We conclude that the house was a self-contained agrarian unit engaged in complex economic activity. The same conceptual plan, housing similar economic activities, can be identified in other dwellings in the southern Levant, from Late Bronze Age I to Late Iron Age IIA. The gradual disappearance of this house type, vis-à-vis the emergence, on the one hand, of smaller and simpler dwellings such as the ubiquitous Four-Room House and, on the other, that of public facilities for specialized economic tasks, signifies to our minds a fundamental ideological and economic transformation, a change in the
         habitusof Levantine society—namely, the gradual segregation between households and various aspects of economic life.<br>
