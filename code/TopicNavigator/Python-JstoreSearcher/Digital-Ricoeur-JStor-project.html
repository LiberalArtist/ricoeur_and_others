  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: “Two more private and particular considerations encouraged me in the work. The first, that I am a Spaniard; the second, that I am a priest of the Society of Jesus.”¹ Such was the explanation offered by the priest and scholar Pedro de Ribadeneyra (1526–1611) for the production of the
                  Historia eclesiastica del scisma del reyno de Inglaterra(henceforth, the “Historia”), his polemical account of the English Reformation. Troublingly, virtually all scholarship on theHistoriahas concentrated on the former factor, to the detriment of our appreciation of the latter.

  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: The question of whether or not humans mourn animals is present in all of my photographic work. This theme emerged in my art when I began looking closely at dead animals and making images of roadkill animals, photographing flower and stone memorials I built around their bodies. My recent project, “Another Death,” portrays museum taxidermic animals that have suffered another kind of death after their initial demise. Frozen in time, they are presented either in the throes of death at another creature’s hand or in a limp resting pose, having just passed. Moments like these appear frequently in natural history<br>

  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: At the moment of his fatal heart attack last November, Jerry Mohrmann was engaged in his normal academic business. He was writing rhetorical criticism. More specifically, he was completing a close analysis of a short but important speech text—John Calhoun’s oration “On the Reception of the Abolition Petitions.” This study had a specific and seemingly narrow focus, but it arose from a number of complex, general issues and incorporated many of Jerry’s characteristic interests. Thus, to recall the history of this project allows us to learn much not only about the man but also about the vocation he pursued.<br>

  Abstract: Sketching the evolution of Israeli and Palestinian symbol use over most of a century raises a significant problem. Many useful critical analyses focus in depth on a particular persuasive message or a specific person’s use of persuasion.¹ In such analytical “snapshots,” the critic has the luxury of being able to carefully describe in detail a given speech, essay, or book. Our project requires a broader approach.<br>

  Abstract: From the bandʹs inception, the Grateful Dead attracted critical attention ranging from insightful to sensationalistic. Often obscured by the media fanfare was the seriousness of the groupʹs project, although some of that early attention was thoughtful, appreciative, and even scholarly. As early as 1966, academics gravitated toward the band, attracted by the intelligence and accomplishment they heard. What was also clear was the depth of the bandʹs commitment, which became one of the hallmarks of the Dead, especially noteworthy in an industry substantially defined by brevity, novelty, and shallowness.

  Abstract: The contemporary Western philosophical scene can be characterized in terms of divisions and interactions between approaches to philosophy which assume that their task is inextricably linked to the development of the natural sciences and approaches which often regard this assumption with considerable suspicion. Philosophers who adopt the former approach have the obvious advantage that the project of which they see themselves as a part produces more and more results which are in principle—if not in practice—publicly testable and which appear to confirm their underlying assumption that science is converging towards an already constituted reality as it is “in<br>

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Abstract: In her project of revisioning moral philosophy, Edith Wyschogrod takes a decisive turn from moral theory to hagiography, from abstract analysis and argument to concrete life stories. The negative motivation for this turn is a critique of moral theory. Two elements of this critique strike me as especially forceful. First, moral theory depends on arguments that do not persuade those outside the hermeneutic circle within which the arguments occur. Thus she points to “the circularity of standard modes of rationality.”¹ The problem is that “background claims … cannot be agreed upon. If there is no common frame of reference, no<br>

  Abstract: This volume has traced the development of the Traveller image as ‘Other’ through mythical and binary discourses of alterity. Until the recent arrival of a more overtly multicultural society in Ireland Travellers have constituted the ‘Other’ for mainstream Irish society. As ‘Other’ they have often acted as objects on whom power is exercised. Their representation and the roles constructed for them have been determined primarily by the settled community and have been influenced by the need to define national, social and class identity. This project of representation has used the tools of mythology and history. These two related aspects of<br>

  Book Title: Britain and Africa Under Blair-In pursuit of the good state<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Julia<br>
  Abstract: Africa was a key focus of Britain’s foreign policy under Tony Blair. Military intervention in Sierra Leone, increases in aid and debt relief, and grand initiatives such as the Commission for Africa established the continent as a place in which Britain could ‘do good’. Britain and Africa under Blair: in pursuit of the good state critically explores Britain’s fascination with Africa. It argues that, under New Labour, Africa represented an area of policy that appeared to transcend politics. Gradually, it came to embody an ideal state activity around which politicians, officials and the wider public could coalesce, leaving behind more contentious domestic and international issues. Building on the story of Britain and Africa under Blair, the book draws wider conclusions about the role of ‘good’ and idealism in foreign policy. In particular, it discusses how international relationships provide opportunities to create and pursue ideals, and why they are essential for the wellbeing of political communities. It argues that state actors project the idea of ‘good’ onto idealised, distant objects, in order to restore a sense of the ‘good state’. The book makes a distinctive and original contribution to debates about the role of ethics in international relations and will be of particular interest to academics, policy-makers and students of international relations, Africa and British foreign policy, and to anyone interested in ethics in international affairs.<br>

  doing good in Africa from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jct4">Britain and Africa Under Blair</a><br>
  Abstract: This book has been about the way in which Britain under New Labour ‘did good’ in Africa as a way of creating a central core of ideal activity for the state. The themes and approaches contained within this trend were not new, but drew on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century ideas about the continent and Britain’s role there. I have suggested that the creation of a good project formed an important part of protecting the state from internal ambiguity and decay, by creating a utopian core at the heart of what it does.<br>

  Book Title: A.S. Byatt-Critical storytelling<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): de Campos Amy J. Edwards<br>
  Abstract: This comprehensive study of A. S. Byatt’s work spans virtually her entire career and offers insightful readings of all of Byatt’s works of fiction up to and including her Man-Booker-shortlisted novel The Children’s Book (2009). The authors combine an accessible overview of Byatt’s œuvre to date with close critical analysis of all her major works. Uniquely, the book also considers Byatt’s critical writings and journalism, situating her beyond the immediate context of her fiction. The authors argue that Byatt is not only important as a storyteller, but also as an eminent critic and public intellectual. Advancing the concept of ‘critical storytelling’ as a hallmark of Byatt’s project as a writer, the authors retrace Byatt’s wide-ranging engagement with both literary and critical traditions. This results in positioning Byatt in the wider literary landscape. This book has broad appeal, including fellow researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students, plus general enthusiasts of Byatt’s work.<br>

  Abstract: Reexamining Emmanuel Levinas's essays on Jewish education, Claire Elise Katz provides new insights into the importance of education and its potential to transform a democratic society, for Levinas's larger philosophical project. Katz examines Levinas's "Crisis of Humanism," which motivated his effort to describe a new ethical subject. Taking into account his multiple influences on social science and the humanities, and his various identities as a Jewish thinker, philosopher, and educator, Katz delves deeply into Levinas's works to understand the grounding of this ethical subject.<br>

He witnessed a crisis of humanism for which a new subjectivity was required. His philosophical writings argue for this new subjectivity, but the question of how this subjectivity can develop begs for an answer. His writings on Jewish education provide some direction. Yet as they guide us in answering this question, other questions emerge. The most obvious is to ask what his argument means for the non-Jewish community.

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Author(s) Horsley Richard A.<br>
  Abstract: The foregoing essays by Valerie Abrahamsen, Peter Oakes, and Eduard Verhoef raise important issues for a project that takes seriously a history from below that does not privilege elite writings and considers carefully the cultural situation at Philippi. All three of the essays focus to some degree on the socioeconomic and religious context of the early Christadherents. Although a full excavation of the site of ancient Philippi is far from complete, the authors use the extant material remains at the site and, by analogy, from elsewhere to construct the social situation of the Philippian Christ-adherents in the first few centuries.<br>

  Author(s) Hunter Lynette<br>
  Abstract: The question here is no longer the much-exercised question of ‘what is cultural studies?’, but rather, ‘for what?’, ‘for whom?’, ‘in the name of what project?’, ‘what politics?’, what properties, orientations and affiliations does cultural studies have, should it have; what methods, aims, intentions; in what context does it see itself; etc.? Jeremy Gilbert thinks through the schema and the question of ‘Friends and Enemies: Which Side is Cultural Studies On?’, while Julian Wolfreys interrogates the manner in which it is too easy to forget the lessons of deconstruction, and to consider cultural studies ‘as if such a thing existed’.<br>

  Book Title: South African performance and archives of memory-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUTCHISON YVETTE<br>
  Abstract: This book explores how South Africa is negotiating its past in and through various modes of performance in contemporary theatre, public events and memorial spaces. It analyses the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a live event, as an archive, and in various theatrical engagements with it, asking throughout how the TRC has affected the definition of identity and memory in contemporary South Africa, including disavowed memories. Hutchison then considers how the SA-Mali Timbuktu Manuscript Project and the 2010 South African World Cup opening ceremony attempted to restage the nation in their own ways. She investigates how the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park embody issues related to memory in contemporary South Africa. She also analyses current renegotiations of popular repertoires, particularly songs and dances related to the Struggle, revivals of classic European and South African protest plays, new history plays and specific racial and ethnic histories and identities.<br>

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur was one of the leading French philosophers of the twentieth centuries. He was also one of the most erudite. From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Gordon James R.<br>
  Abstract: The Holy One in Our Midst: An Essay on the Flesh of Christ aims to defend the doctrine of the extra Calvinisticum—the doctrine that maintains the Son of God was not restricted to the flesh of Christ during the incarnation—by arguing that it is logically coherent, biblically warranted, catholically orthodox, and theologically useful. It shows that none of the standard objections are devastating to the extra, that the doctrine is rooted in the claims of Christian Scripture and not merely a remnant of perfect being philosophical theology, and that the doctrine plays an important role in contemporary theological discussion. In this way, James R. Gordon revives an important Catholic doctrine that has fallen out of favor in contemporary theology. Secondarily, this project aims to integrate biblical, philosophical, and systematic theology by showing that the tools and methods of each distinct discipline can contribute to the goals and aims of the others.<br>

  Book Title: Walter Benjamin and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SYMONS STÉPHANE<br>
  Abstract: In the Arcades Project, Walter Benjamin writes that his work is "related to theology as blotting pad is related to ink. It is saturated with it." For a thinker so decisive to critical literary, cultural, political, and aesthetic writings over the past half-century, Benjamin's relationship to theological matters has been less observed than it should, even despite a variety of attempts over the last four decades to illuminate the theological elements latent within his eclectic and occasional writings. Such attempts, though undeniably crucial to comprehending his thought, remain in need of deepened systematic analysis. In bringing together some of the most renowned experts from both sides of the Atlantic, Walter Benjamin and Theology seeks to establish a new site from which to address both the issue of Benjamin's relationship with theology and all the crucial aspects that Benjamin himself grappled with when addressing the field and operations of theological inquiry.<br>

  Book Title: French Intellectuals Against the Left-The Antitotalitarian Moment of the 1970s<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Christofferson Michael Scott<br>
  Abstract: In the latter half of the 1970s, the French intellectual Left denounced communism, Marxism, and revolutionary politics through a critique of left-wing totalitarianism that paved the way for today's postmodern, liberal, and moderate republican political options. Contrary to the dominant understanding of the critique of totalitarianism as an abrupt rupture induced by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's
      The Gulag Archipelago, Christofferson argues that French anti-totalitarianism was the culmination of direct-democratic critiques of communism and revisions of the revolutionary project after 1956. The author's focus on the direct-democratic politics of French intellectuals offers an important alternative to recent histories that seek to explain the course of French intellectual politics by France's apparent lack of a liberal tradition.<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: The Protestant missionary movement had a profound impact on China, but also left an unintended legacy in the West. Western missions guilt is an unanticipated backlash from the missionary movement, which still reverberates today. Did the missionary movement draw the missionaries inexorably into the imperial project and, thus, the sins of the West? Popular culture in America has castigated the missions movement for decades, and missions in America has seemed to be in a defensive mode. Although missions, particularly North American evangelical missions, continued to expand—with an estimated more than 110,000 American and Canadian long-term Protestant missionaries serving today—<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine angui~<br>

  Book Title: Reading Scripture to Hear God-Kevin Vanhoozer and Henri de Lubac on God's Use of Scripture in the Economy of Redemption<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Storer Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Recent theological discussions between Catholics and Evangelicals have generated a renewed appreciation for God's ongoing use of Scripture for self-mediation to the Church. Noting the significant influence of Henri de Lubac (one of the drafters of 'Dei Verbum' and proponent of a renewal of the Patristic and Medieval emphasis on a spiritual sense of Scripture), and Kevin Vanhoozer (the leading Evangelical proponent of a theological interpretation of Scripture), Kevin Storer seeks to draw Evangelical and Catholic theologians into dialogue about God's ongoing use of Scripture in the economy of redemption. Storer suggests that a number of traditional tensions between Catholics and Evangelicals, such as the literal or spiritual sense of Scripture, a sacramental or a covenantal model of God's self-mediation, and an emphasis on the authority of Scripture or the authority of the Church, can be eased by shifting greater focus upon God's ongoing use of creaturely realities for the building of the Church in union with Christ. This project seeks to enable Evangelicals to appropriate the insights of de Lubac's Catholic Ressourcement project, while also encouraging Catholic theologians to appreciate Vanhoozer's Evangelical emphasis on God's use of the literal sense of Scripture to build the Church.<br>

  Book Title: Citizen Subject-Foundations for Philosophical Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Steven<br>
  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal ~<br>

  Abstract: To clarify the questions raised today by the relations between madness and justice, with reference to the heritage of the French Revolution: such a project, if not confined to the stylistic exercises that typify certain commemorations, is paradoxical in several re spects. Indeed, what prompts current discussions on the function of the psychiatrist in the courtroom or on the role of judgments of civil capacity in the treatment of mental illness, is yet again the perspective offered by the reframing of the Penal Code (including the famous Article 64, which makes “insanity”—or, in the more recent version, “psychic or<br>

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

In the process, she became one of the most important figures in North African literature. In
      Assia Djebar, Jane Hiddleston traces Djebar's development as a writer against the backdrop of North Africa's tumultuous history. Whereas Djebar's early writings were largely an attempt to delineate clearly the experience of being a woman, an intellectual, and an Algerian embedded in that often violent history, she had in her more recent work evinced a growing sense that the influence of French culture on Algerian letters may make such a project impossible. The first book-length study of this significant writer,Assia Djebarwill be of tremendous interest to anyone studying post-colonial literature, women's studies or Francophone culture in general.<br>

But there are two related problems with such a contemporary approach to consumption. First, it is concerned with consumption without relating it to production, and second, the politics of consumption in the practice of political consumerism is not accompanied by a project of ethics. The present chapter seeks to rethink the politics and ethics of consumption<br>

  Abstract: An anthropological investigation into philosophy can provide us with insights and information about traditions of knowledge and intellectual practice elsewhere in the world, in social contexts very different from our own. The project needs to engage with – and first of all be able to identify – philosophy as part of social discourse, and as a social practice, within any given region. Here, I am carving out one particular approach about how this could work, in relation to the Swahili context and against the background of discussions in African philosophy.

  Abstract: In the mid-1980s, Axel Honneth – successor to Jürgen Habermas, and now considered the most prominent representative of the Frankfurt School’s third generation – made an important contribution to the sociophilosophical reading of Pierre Bourdieu’s work that fundamentally shaped its German reception (see Behr, 2001). This contribution is marked by a clear ambivalence. On the one hand, it is obvious that it was in no way gratuitous. Honneth knew from the beginning that Bourdieu’s work was to play a key role in his own project to renew the tradition of critical theory (Honneth, Basaure, Reemtsma and Willig, 2009). At the<br>

  Abstract: Maternity is becoming a visible presence on the contemporary art scene. Around the world, artists like Rineke Dijkstra, Katharina Bosse, Maru Ituarte, Mariángeles Soto-Díaz, Zorka Project, Kate Kretz, Gail Rebhan, and Jess Dobkin address pregnancy, lactation, the postpartum body, the mother-child relationship, and societal expectations of mothers. Some creative practitioners use their maternal position as a point of activist departure, turning to social and political engagement to effect cultural change for parents and children.¹ While many artist-mothers have confronted cultural taboos to speak more fully to their own lived experiences and to challenge heteronormative, raced, and classed expectations of motherhood,<br>

  Abstract: Over fifty years ago, Susan Sontag described “the project of interpretation” as “largely reactionary, stifling”, and placed it in the context of “a culture whose […] dilemma is the hypertrophy of the intellect at the expense of energy and sensual capacity”, before concluding that “interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art”.¹ The situation does not seem to have improved in the intervening half-century. As Martin Paul Eve has very recently observed, “traditional literary criticism

Its project to reconfigure the interplay between religious studies, ethics, and politics became a meaningful topic of analysis and dialogue in the general theological discourse.

It names in essence the spiritual cycle of violence to which we have allowed ourselves to be bound as captives.<br>

  Abstract: A record of the 2015 Building Bridges Seminar for leading Christian and Muslim scholars, this collection of essays explores the nature of divine and human agency through themes of creation's goal, humankind's dignity and task, and notions of sovereignty. Part I sets the context for the book with "Human Action within Divine Creation: A Muslim Perspective" by Mohsen Kadivar of Duke University and "On the Possibility of Holy Living: A Christian Perspective" by Lucy Gardner of Oxford University. The rest of the book includes paired essays-one from a Muslim perspective, one from a Christian perspective-that introduce scriptural material with commentary to aid readers in conducting dialogical study. In her conclusion, coeditor Lucinda Mosher digests the illuminating small-group conversations that lie at the heart of the Building Bridges initiative, conversations that convey a vivid sense of the lively, penetrating but respectful dialogue for which the project is known. This unique volume will be a valuable resource to scholars, students, and professors of Christianity and Islam.<br>

I suggest that reproductive politics are not only the struggle over who controls women’s fertility, but are also the cultural context in which certain relationships are perceived, represented, and reproduced, whilst others are not. Seeing reproductive politics in this way allows us to consider reproduction as related to the national structures that give rise to a need for cosmopolitanism in the first instance, as well as to consider reproduction as related to our understanding of whom we imagine<br>

  Abstract: How—and why—does one do comparative theology? As the essays in this volume demonstrate, there are as many answers to these questions as there are comparative theologians. One’s method and purpose even tends to vary from one project to the next.¹ In part, this is because theology is often driven by questions. Differing questions require differing methods of inquiry. Because comparative theologians delve deeply into more than one religious tradition, we are often compelled by more than one question at a time. Because this anthology addresses

  Book Title: The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw-Space, Materiality, Movement<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oukaderova Lida<br>
  Abstract: Following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union experienced a dramatic resurgence in cinematic production. The period of the Soviet Thaw became known for its relative political and cultural liberalization; its films, formally innovative and socially engaged, were swept to the center of international cinematic discourse. In The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw, Lida Oukaderova provides an in-depth analysis of several Soviet films made between 1958 and 1967 to argue for the centrality of space-as both filmic trope and social concern-to Thaw-era cinema. Opening with a discussion of the USSR's little-examined late-fifties embrace of panoramic cinema, the book pursues close readings of films by Mikhail Kalatozov, Georgii Danelia, Larisa Shepitko and Kira Muratova, among others. It demonstrates that these directors' works were motivated by an urge to interrogate and reanimate spatial experience, and through this project to probe critical issues of ideology, social progress, and subjectivity within post-Stalinist culture.<br>

Irigaray asserts that a rejection or refutation of sexual difference risks committing an ultimate sin. Through this claim, we can glimpse a problematic of evil emerging out of Irigaray’s project that cannot be easily or quickly delimited. Irigaray herself traverses this problematic in her texts, elaborating sources of brokenness and violence as well as concomitant possibilities for regeneration (see, e.g., 1993b, 1993d, and 1996).

First, a crucial premise of the enterprise has shown itself to be unsustainable. It is the assumption that human reason is universal, part of the standard equipment of human nature. As such, it is presumed to be objective, neutral, presuppositionless, the only source of reliable knowledge. As such, it is “nonsectarian” by contrast with the plurality of “religions of the book,” those that appeal to the authority of some particular divine revelation and are in this way heteronomous.<br>

  Book Title: Echoes of the Tambaran-Masculinity, history and the subject in the work of Donald F. Tuzin<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Roscoe Paul<br>
  Abstract: In the Sepik Basin of Papua New Guinea, ritual culture was dominated by the Tambaran —a male tutelary spirit that acted as a social and intellectual guardian or patron to those under its aegis as they made their way through life. To Melanesian scholarship, the cultural and psychological anthropologist, Donald F. Tuzin, was something of a Tambaran, a figure whose brilliant and fine-grained ethnographic project in the Arapesh village of Ilahita was immensely influential within and beyond New Guinea anthropology. Tuzin died in 2007, at the age of 61. In his memory, the editors of this collection commissioned a set of original and thought provoking essays from eminent and accomplished anthropologists who knew and were influenced by his work. They are echoes of the Tambaran. The anthology begins with a biographical sketch of Tuzin's life and scholarship. It is divided into four sections, each of which focuses loosely around one of his preoccupations. The first concerns warfare history, the male cult and changing masculinity, all in Melanesia. The second addresses the relationship between actor and structure. Here, the ethnographic focus momentarily shifts to the Caribbean before turning back to Papua New Guinea in essays that examine uncanny phenomena, narratives about childhood and messianic promises. The third part goes on to offer comparative and psychoanalytic perspectives on the subject in Fiji, Bali, the Amazon as well as Melanesia. Appropriately, the last section concludes with essays on Tuzin's fieldwork style and his distinctive authorial voice.<br>

  Author(s) Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: One of Kenneth Schmitz’s major and undoubtedly lasting accomplishments is his demonstration of the distinctive contribution made by Karol Wojtyla to philosophy. In Schmitz’s masterful expositions, Wojtyla’s philosophical project comes alive as an effort to understand action phenomenologically and realistically, as something that proceeds from and reveals, not consciousness, but the whole person “as a being among other beings.”¹ In this connection, among other things, Schmitz corrects a common misunderstanding of the extent of Wojtyla’s philosophical debt to Scheler’s thought. To be sure, Wojtyla plainly acknowledges the importance to him of both Scheler’s critique of Kant’s ethics and its basis<br>

And yet it should at once be underscored that both the “ethics” in question and the “war” (and peace) to which they aspire to take recourse are of a special brand and breed, belonging to a very specific historical moment. Transformations of the notions both of ethics and of war and peace have accelerated in the course of the twentieth<br>

  Abstract: This collection of papers is the fifth in a series of volumes on the work of the Comparative Austronesian Project. Reflecting the unique experience of fourteen ethnographers in as many different societies, the papers in this volume explore how people in the Austronesian-speaking societies of the Asia-Pacific have traditionally constructed their relationship to land and specific territories. Focused on the nexus of local and global processes, the volume offers fresh perspectives to current debate in social theory on the conflicting human tendencies of mobility and emplacement.<br>

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Did Freud present a scientific hypothesis about the unconscious, as he always maintained and as many of his disciples keep repeating? This question has long prompted debates concerning the legitimacy and usefulness of psychoanalysis, and it is of utmost importance to Lacanian analysts, whose main project has been to stress Freud's scientific grounding. Here Jacques Bouveresse, a noted authority on Ludwig Wittgenstein, contributes to the debate by turning to this Austrian-born philosopher and contemporary of Freud for a candid assessment of the early issues surrounding psychoanalysis. Wittgenstein, who himself had delivered a devastating critique of traditional philosophy, sympathetically pondered Freud's claim to have produced a scientific theory in proposing a new model of the human psyche. What Wittgenstein recognized--and what Bouveresse so eloquently stresses for today's reader--is that psychoanalysis does not aim to produce a change limited to the intellect but rather seeks to provoke an authentic change of human attitudes. The beauty behind the theory of the unconscious for Wittgenstein is that it breaks away from scientific, causal explanations to offer new forms of thinking and speaking, or rather, a new mythology.<br>

Its innovative power made modernity, which began as a local Western phenomenon, a universal project capable of forcing its theoretical and practical principles on all but the most isolated civilizations. “Modern” has become the predicate of a unified world culture.<br>

  Abstract: The theme “Aquinas the Augustinian” provides an occasion to overcome some contemporary stereotypes that pit a Platonic St. Augustine against an Aristotelian St. Thomas Aquinas.

But the differences are far more complementary than contradictory.

  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.<br>

                  The Second Sex, which stands at the beginning of the second wave of feminism: “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.” This most famous sentence from Beauvoir’s book sums up her argument against biological determinism. Beauvoir’s comprehensive and still controversial text also initiated existential feminism, as she developed her themes within the emergence of existentialist philosophy—an open-ended, anti-essentialist, and nonsystematic philosophy that studies life as an undecided project-in-the-making. She did not call herself a feminist at first, but associated<br>

Its project to break down the “walls” of the title – be they between black and white neighborhoods, different class positions in the African American community, or emotional repression mandated by hegemonic gender discourses – situates the text within modernist economies no longer governed by the imperative to save both money and corporeal capital but rather, as Michael<br>

  Abstract: Within the modern West we have learnt to think of the Enlightenment as a secular project which claims to think of individuals as rational selves. Where faith was positioned within pre-modern societies which were organised around tradition, we learnt within an Enlightenment vision of modernity to find reason. People were no longer expected to accept beliefs as a matter of faith but could confidently expect to have to prove their beliefs according to reason. This helped radically to redefine the relationship between public and private spheres and religious belief became a matter of individual choice alone. So it was that<br>

Literature is one of the cultural sites that embodies the consequences of this mutation. As Peter Bürger notes, there is a point at which the activity of the philosophes needs to slide from philosophical inquiry into aesthetic production to carry out the project of the autonomy of reason (1992, 8–11). Through this movement, aesthetics in general and the literary domain in particular become the site of absolute freedom in modern societies, that is, a site where<br>

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniel E. Valentine<br>
  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

Her analysis leads to an inquiry into the intended and real audiences of this fiction, and into the ways its authors try to move them toward more sophisticated social discourse.<br>

  Abstract: Among the canonical markers of utopian writing is the ambiguous location of the ideal society in space and time. Thus, a good point of departure for a discussion of meta-utopian fiction will be a definition of it in terms of its treatment of spatial and temporal dimensions.

  Book Title: Contemporary Majority Nationalism-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): NOOTENS GENEVIÈVE<br>
  Abstract: In light of a renewed interest in the study of nationalism, Contemporary Majority Nationalism brings together a group of major scholars committed to making sense of this widespread phenomenon. To better illustrate the reality of majority nationalism and the way it has been expressed, authors combine analytical and comparative perspectives. In the first section, contributors highlight the paradox of majority nationalism and the ways in which collective identities become national identities. The second section offers in-depth case study analyses of France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, and the United States. This book is an international project led by three members of the Research Group on Plurinational Societies based at Université du Québec à Montréal. Contributors include James Bickerton (St-Francis Xavier University), Ángel Castiñeira (ESADE - Escuela superior de administración y dirección de empresas), John Coakley (University College Dublin), Alain Dieckhoff (Institut d’études politiques, Paris), Louis Dupont (Sorbonne University), Enric Fossas (Unversitat Autònoma de Barcelona), Alain-G.

Moreover, they have shown that there are various ways to approach ethics from an existentialist standpoint and that these ethical endeavours present viable programs. It has thus been established that the existentialist enterprise in practical matters is neither a nihilistic dead end nor a relativistic or purely individualistic project. Every contributor to this collection has in one way or another shown that existentialist ethics implies a fundamental concern with the Other.<br>

  Abstract: How compatible is the intellectual project of a comparative literary history with a postmodern culture? My title signals a potential contradiction from which comparative literary history may, or may not, emerge as still a creative and stimulating area within literary studies and the humanities at large. The contradiction arises if, embracing difference not only as a
                  fait accomplibut as a value sustaining of cultural identities, we set up the comparative viewpoint and activity as, somehow, its philosophical opposite, because of its inevitably universalizing frame of mind (or perhaps merely its universalizing image).

  Abstract: In the immense secondary literature on Nietzsche relatively little attention seems to have been paid to the influence of kynic motives and ideas on both the form and substance of his philosophy. This is the case despite the fact that Nietzsche explicitly associated himself with Kynism¹ in a number of aphorisms,² while at the same time adopting the literary style,³ the manner of philosophizing, as well as important concepts and figures⁴ of this school of antiquity.

  Abstract: Though “tropicalism” has been understood recently as a grand narrative directly implicated in the colonial project, this chapter sets out to complicate this story, too, by exploring the competing discourses of health and place employed by a marginalized population in coastal Ecuador. Through a consideration of various responses to the 1990s cholera epidemic, I illustrate how the appropriation of a biomedical perspective by coastal residents is linked to political and economic transformations in the country that have both enabled and limited the credibility of biomedicine for healing the body tropical.

After all, does not every philosopher by the act of philosophizing engage de facto in the continuation of philosophy? The apparent emptiness of this statement quickly disappears, though, when, as in the case of Vattimo’s philosophical project, there is an announcement of the end of philosophy such that there is indeed a question not actually of whether philosophy is to continue but of the way in which it is able to continue.

It was out of this interest that his massive christological project, the story of the eschatological prophet, emerged. It was also within the context of this project that Schillebeeckx once again engaged the Christian claim that Jesus has universal significance for all of human history, considered in chapter 2. In returning to this claim in the 1970s, however, Schillebeeckx would directly confront the questions of whether and how we can speak of the universal significance of any human person and whether<br>

  Book Title: Walking with the Mud Flower Collective-God's Fierce Whimsy and Dialogic Theological Method<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Jost Stina Busman<br>
  Abstract: Arguing for a retrieval of the landmark work, God’s Fierce Whimsy, Stina Busman Jost establishes the critical importance of this volume for the construction of a dialogic theological method. This is accomplished through a close reading of God’s Fierce Whimsy in which the author identifies key methodological characteristics informing the volume’s formation. Critical importance also is established through interviews with the volume’s authors, the Mud Flower Collective—which included Katie G. Cannon, Beverly W. Harrison, Carter Heyward, Ada María Isasi-Díaz, Bess B. Johnson (Delores Williams), Mary D. Pellauer, and Nancy D. Richardson. Undergirding this endeavor is a recognition of the theoretical importance of difference to the project of theological construction and the vital form of the dialogic as constitutive of theological practice; this is carried forward through engagement with the pivotal theorists Martin Buber and Mikhail Bakhtin, who helped pioneer the philosophical and literary critical importance of otherness, difference, and dialogue. Finally, the author constructively engages recent developments in feminist theologies and postcolonial theories—ultimately making the argument that a dialogic theological method is relevant for the doing of theology today.<br>

  Book Title: Culture, Rhetoric and the Vicissitudes of Life-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>

  Abstract: Inspired by the Rhetoric Culture Project, this volume focuses on the use of imagery, narrative, and cultural schemes to deal with predicaments that arise during the course of life. The contributors explore how people muster their resources to understand and deal with emergencies such as illness, displacement, or genocide. In dealing with such circumstances, people can develop new rhetorical forms and, in the process, establish new cultural resources for succeeding generations. Several of the contributions show how rhetorical cultural forms can themselves create emergencies. The contributors bring expertise from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology and communications studies, underlining the volume's wider relevance as a reflection on the human condition.<br>

  Book Title: The Rhetorical Emergence of Culture-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Girke Felix<br>
  Abstract: "Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.<br>

  Book Title: Godless Intellectuals?-The Intellectual Pursuit of the Sacred Reinvented<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Riley Alexander Tristan<br>
  Abstract: The Durkheimians have traditionally been understood as positivist, secular thinkers, fully within the Enlightenment project of limitless reason and progress. In a radical revision of this view, this book persuasively argues that the core members of the Durkheimian circle (Durkheim himself, Marcel Mauss, Henri Hubert and Robert Hertz) are significantly more complicated than this. Through his extensive analysis of large volumes of correspondence as well as historical and macro-sociological mappings of the intellectual and social worlds in which the Durkheimian project emerged, the author shows the Durkheimian project to have constituted a quasi-religious quest in ways much deeper than most interpreters have thought. Their fascination, both personal and intellectual, with the sacred is the basis on which the author reconstructs some important components of modern French intellectual history, connecting Durkheimian thought to key representatives of French poststructuralism and postmodernism: Bataille, Foucault, Derrida, Baudrillard, and Deleuze.<br>

Foucault spoke frequently of the connection between his intellectual work and his own experience and identity: “I have always held that my books are, in a sense, autobiographical fragments” (2001b: 1566–67).

  Abstract: Modern historiography has often been a tool to legitimate the nation-state ‘objectively and scientifically’. Despite its proclamation of objectivity and scientific inquiry, modern historiography has promoted the political project of constructing national history. Its underlying logic was to find the course of historical development that led to the nation-state. Thus, national history has made the nation-state both the subject and the object of its own discipline. The ‘Prussian school’ provides a typical example. Not only was Ranke the official historiographer of the Prussian state, Droysen’s distinction between ‘History’ (

In 1888 a first set of commentaries was published in theWoman’s Tribune.After her 1893 retirement, Stanton took on the project with intense energy. Other suffrage leaders worried that the proposed book would offend the many traditional Christian women who were being drawn into the suffrage movement, and they urged Stanton to terminate the project.<br>

  Abstract: There is no single way of understanding migration, but the one I know of is to think of it as a journey with a certain goal. In times of global migration, there are countless people on the move every day. They intentionally set forth to make new achievements and take new chances in life. Thus, it often surprises me that there is hardly any empirical research that emphasises the empowering aspects of migration experience, and only a few researchers who conceptualise migration as an exciting, hopeful, future-oriented biographical project (see Morokvasic, 1991, 1993; Apitzsch, 2000, 2003; Lutz, 2000).

We have shown that this process of ‘othering’ remains central to the current settlement in child protection work. Indeed, it is enjoying a vibrant renaissance.<br>

  Abstract: In this collection of essays, contributors seek to analyze the vision of the critical task espoused by Latino/a critics. The project explores how such critics approach their vocation as critics in the light of their identity as members of the Latino/a experience and reality. A variety of critics-representing a broad spectrum of the Latino/a American formation, along various axes of identity-address the question in whatever way they deem appropriate: What does it mean to be a Latino/a critic?<br>

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

Interrogating the notion that Derrida’s work implies the radicalisation of language as a ‘play of differences’, Anderson shows how this can be used to justify various types of readings (she notes the important influence of Richard Rorty in this context) that have reduced his work to an ‘anything goes’ philosophy. Further, other critics such as Searle and Habermas have, Anderson argues, unfairly labelled Derrida’s work as perpetuating indeterminacy and nihilism.

From the disciplinary perspective of Anglo-American film studies, it is a belated intervention indeed. For the question of the spectator is the terrain upon which many of the most significant disciplinary battles over the politics of film theory have been waged over the past three decades. In that time, critical approaches to spectators have proliferated: feminist revisions of psychoanalysis; cultural studies models of differentially ‘decoding’ viewers;<br>

And since textual analysis is in the end empirical, I shall set out to exemplify my methodological account with a single instance. The project is to imagine that Titian’s painting of

The margin of victory (54 per cent of the votes and 25 percentage points ahead of his closest opponent) was, perhaps, overshadowed by Morales self-identification as an indigenous person and as a staunch critic of the neo-liberal project as neo-colonial and undemocratic. This victory raised many doubts from critics and opponents, who saw Morales as unprepared to assume the responsibilities of governing a country. However, under his leadership Bolivia<br>

  Abstract: The first study of Deleuze's critical and clinical projectAidan Tynan addresses Deleuze's assertion that 'literature is an enterprise of health' and shows how a concern of health and illness was a characteristic of his philosophy as a whole, from his earliest works to his groundbreaking collaborations with Guattari, to his final, enigmatic statements on 'life'.He explains why alcoholism, anorexia, manic depression and schizophrenia are key concepts in Deleuze's literary theory, and shows how, with the turn to schizoanalysis, literature takes on a crucial political and ethical role in helping us to diagnose our present pathologies and articulate the possibilities of a health to come.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Deleuze's critical and clinical project and the conceptualisations of health and illness he developed over the course of his careerUses the idea of the literary clinic to unify Deleuze's literary theory with the political critique he developed with Guattari, and argues in this way for a distinctively Deleuzian critical practiceDraws on Deleuze conceptualisations of health and illness to reassess his relationship to key thinkers such as Spinoza, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Melanie Klein and literary figures such as Melville F.

  Book Title: Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis was the most important intellectual development of the twentieth century, which left no practice from psychiatry to philosophy to politics untouched. Yet it was also in many ways an untouchable project, caught between science and poetry, medicine and hermeneutics. This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Saltz David Z.<br>
  Abstract: The fifteen original essays in
      Staging Philosophymake useful connections between the discipline of philosophy and the fields of theater and performance and use these insights to develop new theories about theater. Each of the contributors-leading scholars in the fields of performance and philosophy-breaks new ground, presents new arguments, and offers new theories that will pave the way for future scholarship.Staging Philosophyraises issues of critical importance by providing case studies of various philosophical movements and schools of thought, including aesthetics, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, deconstruction, critical realism, and cognitive science. The essays, which are organized into three sections-history and method, presence, and reception-take up fundamental issues such as spectatorship, empathy, ethics, theater as literature, and the essence of live performance. While some essays challenge assertions made by critics and historians of theater and performance, others analyze the assumptions of manifestos that prescribe how practitioners should go about creating texts and performances. The first book to bridge the disciplines of theater and philosophy,Staging Philosophywill provoke, stimulate, engage, and ultimately bring theater to the foreground of intellectual inquiry while it inspires further philosophical investigation into theater and performance.David Krasneris Associate Professor of Theater Studies, African American Studies, and English at Yale University.

We asked more than forty distinguished scholars to evaluate the current status and future prospects of the discipline, to assess the extent to which we have acquired significant theoretical insights, to tell us where we stand on unresolved debates and why we have failed to resolve them, to evaluate the standards we should use when selecting and applying appropriate methodologies, and to address the broader question<br>

  Abstract: The great government book-collecting project of eighteenth-century China, the “Complete Library in Four Branches of Literature,”¹ offered the Qing government (1644–1912) an opportunity to proscribe and even destroy works it found offensive, particularly those that expressed antigovernment or anti-Qing sentiments. An imperial edict deputed high officials to supervise the burning of the works on the government’s Index Expurgatorius at a site outside the capital city, Peking. After that, except for a remnant surviving in Japan or Europe, the presumption was that all copies of these works were permanently lost, just as the court had intended.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

  Book Title: Counter-Archive-Film, the Everyday, and Albert Kahn's Archives de la Planète<br>

  Author(s): AMAD PAULA<br>
  Abstract: Tucked away in a garden on the edge of Paris is a multimedia archive like no other: Albert Kahn's
      Archives de la Planète(1908-1931). Kahn's vast photo-cinematographic experiment preserved world memory through the privileged lens of everyday life, andCounter-Archivesituates this project in its biographic, intellectual, and cinematic contexts. Tracing the archive's key influences, such as the philosopher Henri Bergson, the geographer Jean Brunhes, and the biologist Jean Comandon, Paula Amad maps an alternative landscape of French cultural modernity in which vitalist philosophy cross-pollinated with early film theory, documentary film with the avant-garde, cinematic models of temporality with the early Annales school of history, and film's appropriation of the planet with human geography and colonial ideology. At the heart of the book is an insightful meditation upon the transformed concept of the archive in the age of cinema and an innovative argument about film's counter-archival challenge to history. The first comprehensive study of Kahn's films,Counter-Archivealso offers a vital historical perspective on debates involving archives, media, and memory.<br>

  Author(s) NEVES MARCELO<br>
  Abstract: The method of rational reconstruction, at which Habermas arrived via two steps—ideology critique and philosophical anthropology—sets itself three tasks. First—and above all—it seeks to ground the normative standards for a critical theory of society (section 2).

  Abstract: In well-run oligarchic societies, the best and simplest way to dismiss egalitarian challenges has long been to deride them as impracticable or “utopian”—and I use the word “utopian” here in the most banal sense, to mean an abstract notion or project that might be viable only in another place or time, or if undertaken by actors unlike ourselves.¹ A society without exploitation, hierarchy, or discrimination might be all very well in theory, but appropriately maintained ideological reflexes ensure that everyone knows that such fancies are not feasible in practice, here and now.

It is a matter of “returning” to the question of representation as an explication of the relation between a subject and an object. Let’s first of all recall that, from 1810 to 1850, Hegel and his disciples were the main figures on the philosophical scene.

Begun in earnest in 1927, and left unfinished at the time of Warburg's death in 1929, theMnemosyne-Atlasconsisted of sixty-three large wooden panels covered with black cloth. On these panels Warburg carefully, intuitively arranged some thousand black-and-white photographs of classical and Renaissance art objects, as well as of astrological and astronomical images ranging from ancient Babylon to Weimar Germany. Here and there, he also included maps, manuscript pages, and contemporary images taken from newspapers. Trying through these constellations of images to make visible the many polarities that fueled antiquity's afterlife, Warburg envisioned theMnemosyne-Atlasas a vital form of metaphoric thought.<br>

  Book Title: Outlaw Rhetoric-Figuring Vernacular Eloquence in Shakespeare's England<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mann Jenny C.<br>
  Abstract: Outlaw Rhetoricexamines the substantial and largely unexplored archive of vernacular rhetorical guides produced in England between 1500 and 1700. Writers of these guides drew on classical training as they translated Greek and Latin figures of speech into an everyday English that could serve the ends of literary and national invention. In the process, however, they confronted aspects of rhetoric that run counter to its civilizing impulse. For instance, Mann finds repeated references to Robin Hood, indicating an ongoing concern that vernacular rhetoric is "outlaw" to the classical tradition because it is common, popular, and ephemeral. As this book shows, however, such allusions hint at a growing acceptance of the nonclassical along with a new esteem for literary production that can be identified as native to England. Working across a range of genres, Mann demonstrates the effects of this tension between classical rhetoric and English outlawry in works by Spenser, Shakespeare, Sidney, Jonson, and Cavendish. In so doing she reveals the political stakes of the vernacular rhetorical project in the age of Shakespeare.<br>

  Abstract: At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

For Saint-Just the promise of the Enlightenment and the goal of revolutionary aspiration was comprehended in the word “happiness.” Contemporary scholars have by and large concurred with Saint-Just’s assessment.

  Book Title: Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Whitehead Chris<br>
  Abstract: Across the global networks of heritage sites, museums, and galleries, the importance of communities to the interpretation and conservation of heritage is increasingly being recognised. Yet the very term "meaningful community engagement" betrays a myriad of contrary approaches and understandings. Who is a community? How can they engage with heritage and why would they want to? How do communities and heritage professionals perceive one another? What does it mean to "engage"? These questions unsettle the very foundations of community engagement and indicate a need to unpick this important but complex trend. Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities critically explores the latest debates and practices surrounding community collaboration. By examining the different ways in which communities participate in heritage projects, the book questions the benefits, costs and limitations of community engagement. Whether communities are engaging through innovative initiatives or in response to economic, political or social factors, there is a need to understand how such engagements are conceptualised, facilitated and experienced by both the organisations and the communities involved.BR> Bryony Onciul is Lecturer in History at the University of Exeter; Michelle Stefano is the Co-Director of Maryland Traditions, the folklife program for the state of Maryland and Visiting Assistant Professor in American Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Stephanie Hawke is a project manager and fundraiser, working on a range of projects aiming to engage communities with cultural heritage.

This creates an air of neglect, which is heightened by the austerity of the subject matter: the street is virtually empty,<br>

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world. Genese Grill holds a PhD in Germanic Literatures and Languages from the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br>

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College.<br>

  Author(s) Jones Siân<br>
  Abstract: Collective memory is a central component within the construction of community groups. Olick and Robbins¹ have argued that ‘collective memory is the active past that forms our identities’ and Samuel² has identified memory as being a dynamic, active, shaping force. Within individual community archaeology projects it is possible to identify the ‘rediscovery’ of memories as the motivating desire behind the instigation of the project in the first instance. Within my PhD thesis I proposed a relational view of community archaeology and argued that community archaeology concerns the relationship between communities and the materiality of their places.³ Interestingly, there appears to<br>

  Abstract: Civil conflict demolishes notions of identity and community in particularly violent and destructive ways. The project of writing civil war challenges the traditions and conventions of historiography and exceeds normal representational modes and idioms. England’s twelfth-century civil war, during the reign of King Stephen (1135–54), is presented by contemporary texts as a calamity beyond the reach of conventional chronicle writing or received rhetoric. The Peterborough recension of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle exclaims that:<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

These periods can be dated roughly: 1943–1950 (between World War II and the Cold War), 1960–1972 (the sixties), and 1988–1994 (usually identified with the year 1989). We can trace through all these periods, despite their obvious discontinuities, the development of a project of a global civic awakening (now taking the form of a global civic society) in opposition to what we might<br>

Abstract: Maria Pia Lara’s
      Moral Textures: Feminist Narratives in the Public Spherefocuses on the relationship between morality, identity, and narrative. In particular, Lara is concerned to amend Jürgen Habermas’s discourse ethics by showing the way in which normative discourse on issues of justice is intertwined with aesthetic forms of communication and discussions of good. In his account of communicative rationality, Habermas distinguishes normative claims to validity from aesthetic ones. While discourse over moral norms appeals to reason and looks to a universal consensus, aesthetic discussions are devoted to making intelligible a certain sensibility and judgment of the good life. Rather than anticipating a universal consensus, aesthetic claims to validity depend upon a commonality in value and identity within groups and cultures for which a given judgment or life project can make sense.<br>

Abstract: 4. Are the paradigm shifts I identified for the study of language as culture in the United States of more general relevance?This possibility was also raised by psychologists in the audience when I presented an earlier draft of the article at the Universit di Padova in October 2000. In the printed version I purposely left out my own speculations in this direction because I felt that I did not have the data and the expertise to venture into other fields, but this is a worthwhile project for others to pursue. After all, many of the writers I mentioned were or are part of wider networks of scholarship extending to other disciplines and other countries. One in fact might see van Dijks comments as the beginning of a widening of the discussion by a major figure in another field, namely, discourse studies. His complaints about what is typically left out of the analysis in linguistics and anthropology not only underscore the privileging of certain contexts for analysis (e.g., spontaneous talk), which is to be expected, but also remind us that text itself is one of those key terms that can be interpreted very differently across disciplines and, I would add, across paradigms. I suspect that a study of how the term text has been interpreted and used in the humanities and social sciences would be an equally exciting exercise, although it would be difficult to justify the same temporal restriction to the 20th century given the ancient hermeneutical traditions from which our contemporary notions of text derive.<br>

Abstract: In his historical writing Calamy affirms continuity within discontinuity. He is working to keep alive a past that has now faded from living memory, and he is reasserting its significance for a new generation of Dissenters in a changing political situation. “We” hold to the same principles and are committed to the same project of reformation, though in different circumstances: “we” are essentially and fundamentally the same as our forebears. Calamy’s counsel is to forgive and remember, not to forgive and forget. And in case of any amnesia about the subsequent political record of the two sides of that discord, Calamy succinctly underlines it:

Abstract: Beginning in the early 1960s, and punctuated by Foucault’s 1966
         Les mots et les choses(The Order of Things) and his 1969L’archéologie du savoir(The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language), poststructuralist critiques of truth claims and the imperialism of global history, a rethinking of the certainty of words and concepts in an “archeology (that is, a deconstruction) of the social sciences” struck at the heart of long‐standingAnnalisteprinciples.91Whether studying social control, discipline, power, or sexuality, old assumptions were dissected and new agendas initiated. The 1976Il formaggio e i vermi(The Cheese and the Worms) by Carlo Ginzburg and the 1979 launching ofmicrostoriaby Ginzburg, Carlo Poni, and Edoardo Grendi—practiced in France by Le Roy Ladurie in his 1975Montaillouand 1979Carnival in Romans—fostered a new kind of ethnographic history of everyday life that focused on the individual.92“The revival of narrative,” whether from Lawrence Stone’s famous 1979Past and Presentarticle or Paul Ricoeur’s 1983–85Time and Narrative,was to restore the story to history and to return to the event, as Pierre Nora had called for in his 1974 essay inFaire de l’histoire.
            93Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979La distinctionpushed for a reconciliation between events and structure.94By emphasizing that systems of oppositions are not stable structures but are constantly in the process of becoming, being made and remade, Bourdieu’s project to understand how social reality is constructed gets us closer to incorporating practice and perception with objective categories and suggests a way of bridging the gap between the endless details of one thing after another and causal explanation. This list of keyAnnalisteideas and methods derived from theMéditerranée’s problematic could include sharp criticism like that of François Dosse; the constructive response of Jacques Revel on theAnnalesparadigms, the social sciences, and the construction of the social; Pierre N~<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: The apologetic project can be compared to rites of institution in that it establishes a social difference—one that becomes part of a group’s self‐understanding—by calling attention to a difference in a preexisting state of affairs.
         61Apologetic theology exploits objective differences between religious traditions in order to establish a community’s sense of its uniqueness. The “demythologization” of apologetics reveals a gap between the social differences constitutive of a community’s sense of identity and the objective differences upon which these are founded. Now, an underlying intent to express communal loyalty takes the form of an oppositional stance in a situation of theological challenge. This oppositional attitude then determines which differences will be incorporated into the group’s self‐understanding. An obliteration of the distinction between social and objective difference, however, creates the illusion that the oppositional attitude plays no active role in the production of communal identity, that it merely follows an awareness of objective difference as an inevitable consequence. One of the dangers of traditional apologetics, then, is for a simple awareness of objective differences between religions to compel an oppositional stance, even when the identity of the home tradition is not threatened. A confusion of social for objective difference allows the directionality from attitude to observation to reverse itself such that the simple awareness of differences between communities evokes an oppositional attitude. By dispelling the illusion that makes opposition an automatic reaction to objective difference, comparative theology frees itself of the false obligation to assume an oppositional stance toward other traditions.<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: The other way of getting the relation of critique and reason wrong, in Bourgeois’s view, is deconstruction, exemplified primarily by Derrida. Deconstruction simply inverts Heidegger’s relations among imagination, time, and meaning. In a breathtakingly reductionistic account of the roots of deconstruction, Bourgeois asserts, “Deconstruction emerges logically from this,” referring to Heidegger’s reading of Kant (p. 20). The closure of meaning (or
      logos) is no longer seen as original but as an aftereffect of chance and the play of language (i.e.,différance) originating from an abyssal flux. Heidegger’s “finitization of reason” (p. 87) places too heavy a burden on an imagination unable to project its ownmost possibility (i.e., closure) out of itself. Realizing Heidegger’s incapacity to think the limit finitely, deconstruction capitalizes on this failure, “subordinating [the productive imagination] to chance or to language itself” (p. 130).<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: It is fitting to conclude my speculations on the disruptiveness of localization to the race/gender/sexuality analogy by briefly examining Haraway’s analytics of race in
         Modest_Witness@Second_Millenium(1997a). Although the essay on race, “Race: Universal Donors in a Vampire Culture” (1997b), begins with a numbingly familiar series of analogies—“Race, like nature and sex, is replete with all kinds of rituals of guilt and innocence in the stories of nation, family, and species … race, like sex, is about the purity of lineage; the legitimacy of passage” (213)—the bulk of the essay derives its interpretive impetus from historically specific articulations. Through a table that periodizes twentieth‐century kinship categories through key objects of knowledge—race, population, and the genome—in three periods in the twentieth century, Haraway both contextualizes the categories of race, sex, and nature and suggests related discontinuities and unfamiliar connections along the chart by seeing the chart as a hypertext. The most insightful of Haraway’s observations derive from rigorous localized analysis. Thus Haraway demonstrates both the humanist impulse behind the Human Genome Project and the raced, colonial workings through which indigenous peoples were once again the objects of knowledge rather than partners in a research agenda (1997b, 249).<br>

Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: When this Hegelian journey of self‐transformative
         Erfahrungis envisaged more concretely as a project of strategically intentional interreligious hybridization, two concomitant prongs of interreligious engagement take shape as its necessary moments. First, in order for an interreligious engagement to involve one’s self‐transformative encounter with the other’s self‐disclosure, it must embody some form of learning about the other in an undistorted way by means of dialogue and immersion in the other’s ideas and practices within a context of mutuality and equal participation. From the perspective of Christian theology, the newly emerging discipline of comparative theology, pioneered by Francis Clooney and others, here offers a model.35Comparative theology demands that I acquire as the proper context of my theological practice both an in‐depth understanding of the texts, symbolisms, rituals, and practices of other religious traditions and a stance of openness and vulnerability to the transformative power of their truth claims, so that my reading of my own Christian tradition may be carried out as an act of self‐critical and nonidolatrous commitment to its distinct claim to truth.36<br>

Author(s): Maggi Armando<br>
Abstract: Within this apocalyptic context the house of Savoy comes to play a prominent role. Tesauro’s first panegyric on the shroud (the
      Commentary) is a “praise” that, through the shroud, indirectly regards the Savoy family. The Savoy duchy had acquired the relic in 1453 from Marguerite de la Roche, the last descendent of the Charny family, which had owned the relic since the fourteenth century.15Tesauro holds that the house of Savoy had been chosen by the Word to preserve the visual memory of his human biography. For the shroud was not only the official relic of a ducal family, it was also its emblem, the visual synthesis of a historical project with openly apocalyptic connotations. Tesauro’s two texts envision the Savoy dynasty as the defender of Catholicism against foreign heretical countries. When Tesauro delivered his first panegyric in 1627, the Savoy duchy was already deeply involved in the Thirty Years War (1618–48), although his text makes no explicit reference to the European conflict.<br>

Abstract: One finds in the work of Hans Frei one of the most provocative and insightful challenges to the project of theological hermeneutics. From tracing the trajectory of hermeneutics through modernity, with its bifurcation of the narrative coherence of scripture into “meaning” or historical reference, to arguing that hermeneutics effectively dissolves the uniqueness of the identity of Jesus Christ, by determining general categories of understanding within which Christ’s salvific activity is to be understood, Frei’s work displaces hermeneutics from its central place in the modern theological canon. This displacement has opened the possibility of a turn to narrative, figural, or typological interpretations of scripture.<br>

Abstract: An example of a similar project being attempted for very different ideological purposes is Hilton Kramer and Roger Kimball’s “Farewell to the MLA,”
                  New Criterion13 (1 Feb. 1995),http://www.mugu.com/cgi‐bin/Upstream/People/Kimball/mla.html.Here Kramer and Kimball compile anecdotal information on what is being cited at the Modern Language Association convention:
                        
                  Meanwhile, as one of us listened to these assaults on Conrad and Cather, the other chose to visit the session on “Feminist Perspectives on the Frankfurt School,” which drew a standing‐room‐only crowd and turned out to offer a little of everything—except, of course, literature. No sooner had we seated ourselves and unpacked the trusty tape recorder than we heard the familiar whine of the dentist’s drill—no, sorry, our mistake: it was only the sound of the first speaker, who had come to “clarify the function of femininity in Frankfurt School thought, with an emphasis on re‐reading the work of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the context of gender.” Ah, yes, we knew it well: the “critique of patriarchy and logocentricsm,” old friends such as the feminist icons Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, not to mention Judith Butler, the young philosopher of queer theory who our rough tabulation identified as the second most frequently referred to person at the convention. The most frequently cited figure was undoubtedly Walter Benjamin, the hapless Marxist critic and protege of Adorno who committed suicide while fleeing from the Nazis in 1940.<br>

Abstract: To conduct the research, I first identified a teacher at Eternal Grace who was herself a member of the school’s faith community.
         5With the help of two project assistants,6I then observed and tape‐recorded the entirety of her 3‐month‐long Holocaust unit, interviewing her before and after the unit and following the reactions of a group of five students throughout. The students were selected for their adherence to the school’s faith—in Alan Peshkin’s (1986) terminology they were “believers” rather than “scorners”—and each was interviewed individually. The data sources included transcribed class sessions, interviews, collected curricular materials, written field notes, and copies of all student work. Using techniques from grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin1990), the transcriptions were coded for emergent categories of meaning. From them we rendered a portrait (Lawrence‐Lightfoot and Davis1997) of the religious master narratives at play and an interpretation of how they contributed to students’ understandings of the Holocaust (Schweber and Irwin2003).<br>

Abstract: I trust that what I have written here clarifies, in the course of the discussion, the relevance and significance of the seven characteristics of Don Browning’s style of theologizing. Following in his footsteps I hope to have made a contribution to the public theology he espouses—the first characteristic I mentioned at the beginning of this article. I trust that I have likewise shown my interest—the second characteristic—in the institutions determining people’s concrete daily lives, as well as influencing and coloring their norms, values, and religiosity. I have referred specifically to the institution of law, especially human rights law. The third characteristic is also clear: as Browning’s study of marriage and the family is conducted in a global, more especially an interreligious perspective, I have paid due attention to interreligious interaction and dialogue, which dominate not only politics and the mass media but also the conversations in our living rooms. Both of us are convinced that any public theology must be characterized by an empirical approach—the fourth characteristic. In his family project, Browning not only collaborates with social scientists but also incorporates their empirical research into the goal and content of his project. In this article, I, too, have used insights from political and social sciences, as well as empirical‐theological research, in order to relate the assumptions and principles of interreligious interaction and dialogue directly to empirical reality.<br>

Or, if we were seriously to consider it as a semiotic project, it might be part of the Department of Oxymoronica, containing sciences that are self‐contained and analytically impossible. For Eco, there can be no phenomenology of forgetting.109<br>

Abstract: Other recognition theories, in particular those of Hegel and his followers, have explored important insights regarding the integration of recognition into knowledge. If these insights are right, grasping an object with a concept would engage one’s thoughts in a self‐recognition project that is arguably in line with the “lived experiences” referred to by Ricoeur. The section dealing with the “ruins of representation” misses the opportunity to show how to reconstruct knowledge claims on these ruins. On the one hand, one could argue that a theory of knowledge would simply be sided with a compatible theory of recognition. On the other hand, neo‐Hegelians, such as Robert B. Brandom, would press for profound changes in the way that theories of knowledge are to be understood. It is left to the reader to locate the hermeneutical analysis of Ricoeur in this debate.<br>

Abstract: To anticipate a criticism of the use of Habermas’s discourse ethics, there should be acknowledgment of Bent Flyvbjerg’s opinion, which is shared by a number of people: “The basic weakness of Habermas’s project is its lack of agreement between ideal and reality, between intentions and their implementation” [
      36, p. 215]. In directly countering Habermas’s discourse ethics, Foucault says, “The problem, then, is not to try to dissolve [power relations] in the utopia of completely transparent communication but to acquire the rules of law, the management techniques, and also the morality, the ethos, the practice of the self, that will allow us to play these games of power with as little domination as possible” [37, p. 298]. However, Habermas does admit, “Bargaining processes are tailored for situations in which social power relations cannot be neutralized in the way rational discourses presuppose” [38, p. 166]. Their positions are not so far apart, and the common ground is the ethics of the discursive practice. Furthermore, Habermas and Foucault share some phenomenological justification for their positions. Communication may not be transparent, as the Habermasian ideal would prefer, but neither is power a totally corrupting force. There are times when the discourse in librarianship will be agonistic (competitive and possibly strained); an agreed‐upon set of rules for ethical communication is still the most effective antidote to disruption and authoritarianism and assurance of rights being recognized.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: What, then, for Derrida, is European responsibility or responsibility as something specifically European? The conflicting exigencies formulated in the foregoing discussion of the concept of responsibility require the invention of a new way in which to renew, revive, or replay the figure, concept, or idea of Europe. European responsibility is, first of all, this openness to
      bothtraditions of responsibility, namely, Platonism and Christianity. It consists in exposure to the radically conflicting demands that these two traditions make upon their heirs as responsible selves. European responsibility is above all the uncompromising willingness to assume the challenge posed by the aporetic nature of inheritance itself—that is, by the constitutive lack of handed‐down rules or norms to negotiate contradiction. Consequently, Europe is the name for a responsibility that also goes hand in hand with the necessity of having to invent, each time anew, new ways of meeting mutually exclusive demands. As a simultaneous responsibility to, at first, two opposite traditions, European responsibility consists in not letting one of the traditions overturn, outplay, or outdo the other. By doing justice to its double heritage, and not shunning the necessity of negotiating conflicting demands in the absence of pregiven norms or rules, such responsibility not only entails a radical refusal of traditionalism, for structural reasons, but also is distinguished by openness to other traditions and demands. Indeed, from the moment that Europe is understood as a responsibility to more than one tradition or set of injunctions, its responsiveness and responsibility extend to all other traditions. Apart from being hospitable to other historically and culturally decisive intra‐European differences (such as Judaism and Islam—not in the abstract, however, but with all their shades and forms), as well as to the many minor, or marginal, differences within Europe, this principal openness that the name E~<br>

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: As mentioned above, the Sāṃkhya doctrine that preoccupied the author(s) of the
         Brahma‐sūtrawas the doctrine of insentientpra
            dhānaas the world cause. Thepra
            dhānadoctrine presented an immediate challenge to theBrahma‐sūtra’s project of establishing brahman as the universal purport of the Upaniṣads. That all the Upaniṣads speak of Brahman as the fundamental cosmic principle is by no means obvious. TheBrahma‐sūtraselected brahman from a series of possible candidates mentioned in various places within the Upaniṣadic corpus—prāṇa,puruṣa,akṣara, and so on.18If brahman’s claim to be the absolute cosmic principle seems obvious to us today, this is due to the now virtually unrivalled influence of the Vedāntic interpretation. During the time of the composition and redaction of theBrahma‐sūtra, however—that is, during Vedānta’s formative period—it was the Sāṃkhya school that most likely held a privileged and influential position within the brahmanical tradition.19Thus, the author of theBrahma‐sūtra, almost immediately after proposing brahman as the universal import of the Upaniṣads and as the world cause, is obliged in I.1.5ff. to repudiatepra
            dhāna’s claim to that title. That theBrahma‐sūtra’s concept of brahman was developed in the context of a rejection of thepra
            dhānaconcept suggests a more intimate connection between polemics and doctrine in the formative stages of Vedānta than is usually acknowledged. To be specific, Vedānta’s insistence on the conscious nature of brahman appears to have been inextricably bound up with the explicit rejection of insentientpra
            dhānaas the world cause. And it is this insistence that forms the basis of the great teaching of the Vedānta, namely, the identification (however conceived by the various traditions of Vedānta) of brahman, as cosmic principle, andātman, as the principle of consciousness.20<br>

Abstract: Characteristic of this new attitude toward the past are the closing words of Sanders’s recently published volume,
         Adaptation and Appropriation(2006), in the Routledge Critical Idiom series. Opening her final paragraph with the claim that “We need then to restore to the subgenres or practices of adaptation and appropriation a genuinely celebratory comprehension of their capacity for creativity, and for comment and critique,” she concludes: “Adaptation and appropriation … are all about multiple interactions and a matrix of possibilities. They are, endlessly and wonderfully, about seeing things come back to us in as many forms as possible” (Sanders2006, 160). This is the rhetoric of hedonistic liberalism, celebrating multiplicity and pluralism for its own sake, for the choices it allows; it is Fredric Jameson’s postmodernity whose “relationship to the past is that of a consumer adding another rare object to the collection, or another flavour to the international banquet” (1998, 129). Typically, there is no word about the future re‐vision might help to envision, no sense of “memory as a means to liberation” (Greene1991b, 291), of the interlocking of memory and the feminist project, of looking back in order to move forward. On the left, concerns about the disappearance of the future and capitalism’s increasing monopoly on it are growing, as are laments about the loss of a sense of historical time as a teleology moving away from a past from which we could learn and into a future that would be different (see Gumbrecht2004, 120; see also Jameson2005). There are those who are bitter about it, complaining, as does Terry Eagleton inAfter Theory(2003), that “Over the dreary decades of post‐1970s conservatism, the historical sense had grown increasingly blunted, as it suited those in power that we should be able to imagine no alternative to the present” (Eagleton2003, 6–7).

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: The coordination of the work of involuntary memory with the work of dreams is the vehicle for Marcel’s recuperation of his amorous self. He renounces his current, self‐centered self for the altruistic self that embodies “the diminished life” of his resurrected grandmother.
         63I have used elsewhere the predicate of “altruism” to designate a project of self‐expression that incorporates alterity as its very raison d’être, arguing that genuine altruism is found in the expressions of human love.64In this perspective, one could say that Marcel’s strategy of amorous self‐discovery promotes at once the affirmation and the negation of personal will. Just as Schopenhauer’s rejection of the self‐serving egoism of individual will may be seen as revisionistic, and narrower in existential options, with respect to Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility ofvoluntasin the amorous individual, so may Marcel’s commitment to the recuperation of his amorous self be seen as revisionistic with respect to Schopenhauer’s obstruction of will’s self‐affirmation. Marcel’s willful annihilation of his self‐centeredmoiis the diametrical opposite to will’s nihilistic destruction of the self; by renouncing his self‐centeredmoi, in fact, Marcel manages to salvage his altruistic self from the oblivion of unconscious memory, and thereby affirm it.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Earlier I stated that just‐war morality involves a spiritual exercise—an ascesis—demanding political elites and ordinary citizens to discipline their attitudes, practices, and representations of the Other.
         75I also said that such an idea suggests a controversial point that harks back to an idea from Augustine, namely, that virtue is grounded in the practice of confession. We are now in a position to see how that is so. Confession for Augustine was not solely or chiefly a matter of privately disclosing personal temptation and wrongdoing, as is often thought. Such personal reports are part of a more general practice of rendering oneself accountable to standards that one does not wishfully create (or project), objective norms by which to measure one’s subjective leanings and desires. Confession, in short, is a matter of making oneself accountable to standards and purposes beyond one’s immediate interests. For Augustine and for those who follow in his path, self‐knowledge quickly slides into excessive self‐love and self‐deception without objective reference points by which to measure oneself. Self‐knowledge, including one’s personal and social memories, must be tested by the principle of reality. Virtue for Augustine thus relies on the willingness to submit oneself to norms by which to evaluate one’s loyalties and commitments. In our self‐reflexive acts, we must ask ourselves whether our self‐interpretation is grounded in reality or fabricated with an eye toward self‐justification.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: In this revised dissertation, W. David Hall argues that Paul Ricoeur’s religious writings can offer an important context for interpreting his philosophical project—that, in fact, Ricoeur’s philosophical writings take on more of a theological tenor over time, especially if one focuses on their growing emphasis on ethics. This development, Hall argues, culminates in a creative tension between love and justice that finds its peak in a confrontation between the ideas of autonomy and theonomy. “The love command lends an imperative structure to the ideal of love that opens it to moral judgment in general and ideals of justice in particular” (2), yet without turning into something reducible to the Kantian notion of a moral categorical imperative. Rather, what is at issue is a “poetic” use of the imperative in Ricoeur’s thought.<br>

Abstract: I obviously cannot set forth an entire theological ethics in one lecture. Besides, if I could do that, it would put an end to my writing books. I do not want that to happen! These limitations noted, what can be said? In sum, I seek to reclaim the task of humanizing religion as an enduring religious and cultural project buried deep within social and cultural legacies but now revised along lines intimated by the critiques of knowledge, power, and value. The work of reconstructing a discipline requires a hermeneutic of retrieval but also innovation. I judge too that it requires, at its most conceptual level, escaping forms of thought systematically dominated by the concept of a “center,” a human or divine agent or subjectivity and intersubjective relations or the deconstruction of those binaries still tied to that logic. And, further, it requires probing basic sensibilities of existence, the love of life and the remembrance of death, in order to articulate theologically the sense of responsibility and also the good that human action can and ought to serve. Let me explores these matters.<br>

Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Kant's entire theological project can be read as the setting off of these parerga from the moral core of religion. By contrast, what Coleridge does is return the parerga to the very heart of the subject’s experience: in a sense, he deconstructs, according to the logic of the Derridean supplement, the
         ergon(work) and theparergon(border) of Kant’s religion of reason. For instance, Kant’s moral law stood alone: a moral lawgiver could be inferred, but this inference added very little in justifiable knowledge. Essentially, God became a hypothetical reflex of the moral law, and his nature and even existence was, apart from this context, inscrutable.37Conversely, for Coleridge, responsibility to the moral law is irreducibly personal, and a sense of a personal God is fundamental for responsibility to exist at all. As he writes in the 1825 edition ofAids to Reflection, religion is “the hidden Spring and Fountain‐head of all true Morality,” and it is “impossible to separate the Moral from the Religious.”38A similar reversal occurs with grace. Kant assented that humanity should be able to fulfill the moral law, and yet radical evil meant that they could not. As such, grace is inevitably inscribed as a hope in our moral experience, but one that Kant reduced to a parergon, “wholly transcendent … salutary to hold … at a respectful distance.”39On the other hand, as our initial discussion made clear, humanity’s need for redemption is utterly fundamental to Coleridge: grace is a solecism for the former but the very heart of moral experience for the latter. From what has already been said, the same pattern very clearly applies to prayer: a parergon for Kant, one of the highest necessities of human experience for Coleridge.<br>

Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: This problematic—acknowledged in various ways by Blumenberg, Gauchet, and others—continues to resonate in present-day efforts to revise the secularization thesis. For example, Bell notes that French nationalism has yet to reconcile its universalist principles with the diverse identities of the populations it is meant to encompass. In a similar manner, Sepinwall's Grégoire recoiled from Revolutionary universalism once it ceased to conform to his particular designs for citizenship. According to Sutcliffe, Judaism haunted Enlightenment-era thinkers precisely because it reminded them of a grounded source of religious, political, and moral values that they could not uproot. Finally, the “cultural bible” of Sheehan's study represents the ultimate disintegration of theological givenness into an array of appropriations: the Scripture can now serve whatever task its human inventors have at hand. All these instances show secularization to be what Taylor has also claimed: a project that will perhaps never be completed. It is hardly surprising, then, that historians of the Enlightenment would seek to redefine a movement that has come to spin in such disorienting circles.<br>

Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: Tillich’s political writing frequently unites critique and gift.
         26The main resource for our reconstruction is his 1929 essay,Protestantism as Critical and Creative Principle.27In this writing Tillich provided an important impulse to examining the aporia between the political and the nonpolitical, and he introduced a different manner of thinking.28He upheld the two demands of any theology of correlation: there should be reciprocity between the political and theology that does not violate the integrity of each domain. I will show how the lines of thought in this essay on critique and gift alter this correlation project in a way that upholds these essential demands even if it seems to weaken the autonomy of the two domains of the theological and the political. After detailing the lines of Tillich’s essay that we will take up, I will offer a reconstruction of the prophetic as promise. This will issue into a need to develop practices of promise that are otherwise than sovereign.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The way in which Blanchot appropriates
            anddistorts Lévinas's work seems to have been missed by most scholars. Either they tend to take Blanchot at his word, thus assuming that Blanchot's admiration and support of Lévinas's project is almost completely untainted by critique, or they miss altogether the allusion to Lévinas in Blanchot's descriptions of Judaism, thus reading them as mere simplification and allegorization. For an example of the former, see Georges Hansel, “Maurice Blanchot, son ami, son allié,” inEmmanuel Lévinas-Maurice Blanchot, penser la différence, ed. Éric Hoppenot and Alain Milon (Paris, 2008), pp. 285–97. For an example of the latter, see Kevin Hart,The Dark Gaze:Maurice Blanchot and the Sacred(Chicago, 2004), p. 187, where he suggests that Blanchot's description of Judaism in the section entitled “Being Jewish” inThe Infinite Conversation, discussed below, “is ultimately Hegelian. Judaism belongs to a dialectical movement: things happenso thatother things might be generated in turn.” Hart even gives Hegel more credit as a philosopher of religion, adding that “Hegel would pay a little more attention to the specifics of religious practice” (ibid.). Blanchot exposes himself to this misreading by notalwaysbeing explicit about his method of commentary. It is nonetheless surprising that his practice of repetition and distortion is so often missed by critiques given his own frequent statements about the practice of commentary and repetition as a mode of writing.<br>

Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Yet the structure of theatrical identification changes when the actor returns to the stage as Helen and Faustus are swept up into their erotic union. Then it is Faustus who consumes and is ravished by Helen as an impersonation, and insofar as the audience becomes swept up in the high power of Marlowe's heroic verse and in the actors' ability to project erotic desire and fulfillment, they too become transported by the pleasures of the illusion of rhetorical and theatrical embodiment. The play increases the terror of the pleasure of this identification by juxtaposing this celebration of magical and theatrical mimesis to the theological imperatives of the old man, who appears here specifically in contrast to Helen's conjuration. The old man's theological directives (“break heart…and mingle it with tears” [5.1.40]) remind the audience of their obligation to attend to their faith just at the moment when their inclinations are being most sorely tested by the erotics of the spectacle that they are witnessing. In making the audience aware of the requirements of faith while ravishing them with theatrical spectacle, the play lays bare the dangers of identification with Faustus, whose desire to consider repentance is repeatedly obscured by his absorption in the shows Mephistopheles stages. Yet again and again the audience is invited to enjoy Mephistopheles' spectacles while being made aware that the aesthetic effects of these same spectacles serve to bring Faustus ever closer to the point at which it would be too late for him to repent. Even when Faustus acts less as a passive consumer of Mephistopheles' theater pieces and more as a jester who seeks to “delight” his patrons “with some mirth” (4.1.90), the audience is encouraged to feel that Faustus represents their interests, as it were, since even his cheapest tricks stand as forms of social wish fulfillment. If Faustus and Mephistopheles are able to slap around the pope and his friars despite their curses, not only do they t~<br>

Abstract: Vásquez’s overall project is to “rematerialize” (as he puts it) the study of religion, and the key to his positive theoretical position lies in the way he conceptualizes materialism. His focus on this rematerialization is on three areas: the body, practice, and emplacement. The book is divided into three parts, each corresponding to these domains. However, it is indicative of his interests and intentions that part 1 on embodiment contains seven chapters, while parts 2 and 3 contain two chapters each. He chooses materialism “because it approaches religion as it is lived by human beings, not angels” (5).<br>

Abstract: This approach has been refined and adapted in subsequent studies, including those of Douglas herself, and its working assumption continues to inspire research. In particular, biblical scholars have enthusiastically developed the premise that the body can serve as a medium of expression onto which social ideals and patterns are projected. For example, Howard Eilberg-Schwartz writes: “The fluids of the body turn out to be a kind of language in which various religious themes find their voice.”
            
                  Even more forcefully, Jon Berquist views the laws of bodily fuids as implying an aspiration for bodily wholeness, itself a microcosm for the ideal Israelite society:12
               
                  With all due respect for the ingenuity required for such homologies, these studies raise several difficulties. For instance, assuming that these symbolic interpretations were external to the conscious motives of the ancient Israelites observing various ritual practices, these studies fail to explain by what mechanism these symbolic schemes (unconsciously) emerged. Furthermore, these interpretations assume a questionable mind-body dualism in which the body serves as a vehicle of expression which can effectively be disregarded once the encoded message is comprehended.The whole body, for Israel, was not only a construction of how culture expected the physical body to operate and perform; the body was also a representation of how the society should organize itself and function, in the smallest units (the family or household) as well as the largest (the tribe, the nation, the colony, or any other form of the “body politic”).

                  they rarely address the possibility that the project itself is fundamentally ill-conceived.15

Abstract: My motive here is to bring preexisting scholarship to bear on the project of the moment and thereby to help avoid “reinventing the wheel” in the anthropological study of morality. If this is granted, however, it is legitimate to ask why not include evil of the demonic and diabolical type, as well as witchcraft and sorcery? For present purposes my answer is that the relation of evil to morality is mediated by the demonic realm in a way that is not the case with witchcraft, and in some ways the problem of human evil, or homodicy as I called it above, is peripheral in the literature. Several brief examples will have to suffice. When explicitly addressing “the problem of evil” in his study of devil-beliefs and rites in the milieu of sugar plantations in Colombia and tin mines in Bolivia, Taussig (
         1980) is oriented toward explicating their symbolic/ideological representation of colonial caste and class oppression and confrontation between Christian and indigenous religion. He does so in a way that leans more toward their political and economic than their moral consequences, and toward the restructuring of the relation between the ethical and cosmic order with the Christian introduction of a dualism radically distinguishing good and evil that substituted what he calls a moral for a normative concept of sin. Peasant contracts with the devil are not about evil but about resistance to the threats against cultural integrity, and in addressing the “sociology of evil,” Taussig refers mostly to sorcery rather than to devil-beliefs. Indeed, the aura of Conradesque darkness and cruelty evoked by his later study of shamanic healing during the rubber boom along the Putamayo River is in some ways a more explicit meditation on evil (Taussig1987).<br>

Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: These empathic responses, however, need not be limited to the location of the playhouse. As Donald C. Freeman has argued, the human tendency to schematize bodily experience and then “project elements of this structure and components of our physical experience onto our non-physical, abstract experience” is at work in the process of writing, reading, and watching tragedy.
      
            Any engagement with tragedy necessarily entails at least an imagination of the types of pain that actors would portray on stage, but there is an undeniable intensity to theatrical portrayal of pain, as evidenced by those performances that cause audience members to look away or to wince. These types of reactions demonstrate the power of imagination, as if we feel in our own bodies what is enacted on stage. Through an inductive process stimulated by such imagination, tragedy uses representations of pain from things like poison or torture to communicate something about human suffering of all types. It is a genre built on associations of physical and metaphysical suffering that creates interpretive communities with a new understanding—physical, cognitive, affective, spiritual—of human pain.32

Abstract: There is much ado about religion and American politics. Political scientist David S. Gutterman has written an engaging but somewhat limited study of the “prophetic” impulse as a window onto the relation between religion and politics. He compares Billy Sunday, Martin Luther King, Jr., Promise Keepers (PK), and Call to Renewal (CTR), focusing on their readings of Exodus. It is an intriguing project, yet there are questions about its distinctiveness and about Gutterman's attentiveness to the study of religion.<br>

Abstract: The essays in
         Eric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsare uniformly excellent in their exploration of “foundations without foundationalism”; however, like most volumes of collected essays, it only offers suggestions of a synthesis between Voegelin and postmodernism. Both have different interpretations of classical philosophy and transcendence; both are critics of the metaphysical certainty of the Enlightenment project; and both fail to offer a theory of institutionalized politics. Interestingly, at the end of the volume, the editors propose Camus as a possible synthesis to understand Voegelin and other postmodern thinkers. They fail to develop this theme, however, which is all the more puzzling, since both editors have written on Camus (“Reconstructing the World: Albert Camus and the Symbolization of Experience,”JOP61:2 [1999]); or, it may be that they plan a sequel that will expand on their suggested synthesis.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: jams.2004.57.issue-3<br>
Date: February 2005<br>
Author(s): Higgins Paula<br>
Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of Roland Barthes's writings on myth and ideology, this essay seeks to expose the historical legitimation project through which the mythmaking, universalizing rhetoric of musical genius that has long surrounded the figure of Ludwig van Beethoven came to infiltrate scholarship on Josquin des Prez, culminating in his late twentieth-century apotheosis. Contextualizing the composer's reception history with respect to the debates between Joseph Kerman and Edward Lowinsky in 1965 and especially the 1971 Josquin Festival-Conference, the author suggests that the ideological refashioning of Josquin in the image of Beethoven has simultaneously shaped and derailed the intellectual trajectory of early music scholarship in the past thirty years. By privileging a discourse of musical genius in the service of which, among other concerns, the canon of works attributed to the composer is being decimated beyond historical recognition, the richness and complexity of the musical culture of which he was a vital part risks being overshadowed and obfuscated by the disproportionate amount of attention invested in his singular accomplishments. The essay advocates a resolute historicization of sixteenth-century discourses of creative endowment, a critical reassessment of the role of authentication scholarship in Josquin studies, and a renewed sensitivity to the imbrication of mythologies of musical genius in music historiographies of both the past and the present.<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing Co.<br>
Issue: i260459<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Willis Kevin J.<br>
Abstract: This article draws upon theories from a wide range of disciplines, including cultural studies and literary theory, to analyse representations of schooling in rock and pop songs. The songs selected cover a period from the beginning of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, to Britpop and the present. It is argued that schooling is overwhelmingly represented as the antithesis of leisure and that in the 1960s conjuncture the representations of schooling became more and more critical. Even so, the resolution to the perceived oppression of schooling takes place at an imaginary level of fantasy. Other features of these representations are discussed, including the challenge provided in pop and rock songs to the notion of schools as spaces where relationships, romantic and/ or sexual, do not take place. The way in which temporal aspects of schooling are represented and the division between clock time and time as experienced is discussed. The formal analysis is located within a larger project of ideology critique and its strengths and weaknesses are signalled.<br>

Abstract: In a practice environment that unswervingly promotes the systematic tendencies of efficient architectural productivity, to the detriment of architectural creativity, it becomes increasingly important for studio pedagogy to recover and sustain an imaginative engagement with the richness and ambiguity of lived reality. Inhabiting the Chasm is a studio project that attempts to deny the urge to rationalize program and structure and any unchallenged participation in the prevailing apparatus of conventionalized graphic depiction. The project focuses on the simultaneously unfathomable yet familiar reality of two individuals in love. It encourages a perception of the architect as place maker, as interpreter of dynamic human events, and as creator of the settings for the unraveling of dramatic human action.<br>

Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
Issue: i262178<br>
Date: 2 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Bozdogan Samuel<br>
Abstract: The following essay considers Josep Lluis Sert's American Embassy in Baghdad (1955-1961) as an attempt to project a new basis for American political influence abroad that was compatible with a rapidly changing postcolonial world. Although the United States began its program of embassy construction to accord with its new role as a world power, the government required architects to be sensitive to local conditions of the site and the host country. In Iraq, this meant distinguishing America from both a rival Soviet Union and from England, America's ally but increasingly despised by Iraqis for its uninvited sway over their government, as well as addressing questions of climate and local construction capacities. To negotiate political complexities of the cold war and to balance American ambitions with local conditions, Sert drew on a modernism that was itself in the process of transition due in part to its application to a broader range of building types and social tasks, of which the embassy program is an instance, and in part to the representational pressures such institutional patronage entails.<br>

Article Title: Against Wholeness: The Ego's Complicity in Religion<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Vergote Volney P.<br>
Abstract: Many students of religion suggest that wholeness or the attainment of an integrated self is an especially valuable goal whose attainment marks a moment of religious insight. Theoreticians like Jung, Allport, and Maslow strongly support this belief. Freud does not. To reconcile the two camps one must either drop Freud altogether or confine his critique of religion to an attack upon neurotic religion, or more exactly, religion based upon superego functioning. One could then claim that healthy religion is a function of the ego, e.g., the ego's tendency towards integrated functioning and the attainment of 'wholeness'. I argue that this ploy, which is itself a function of an egosyntonic desire for wholeness, is altogether wrong. It misrepresents Freud's ego psychology and it therefore misrepresents his critique of the ego's role in religion as well. First, his theoretical, as opposed to his literary, critique of religion is also a critique of certain characteristics of the ego. Second, these characteristics, especially the ego-syntonic drive towards feelings of wholeness, are functions of the ego's obedience to repetition compulsion. Third, the later texts on religion cannot be understood apart from their roots in Freud's earliest theory of ego functioning, especially the physicalist program he developed in his "Project" of 1895. The ego creates and takes part in religious dramas which present an illusory world of wholeness and completion of self. But as the seat of reality testing it must pierce the veils as quickly and as repeatedly as it weaves them.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i263809<br>
Date: 9 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Zaleski Charles T.<br>
Abstract: Concluding his "Confessions," Augustine chose as the work's final word aperietur, "will be" or "shall be opened." The oddity of ending and closing a book on a conjugation of to open provokes reflections into the nature of questioning, reflections that open into a larger investigation concerning how Augustine understood the nature of religious belief and faithful life. For him, faithful life is a project of resisting our always premature attempts at conclusion, in order better to see the project of "inquiry into God" as an infinite undertaking, in community with others, organized centrally around reading and inhabiting the thought world of the Scriptures. The "Confessions" turns out to be a story of Augustine learning to ask questions in the right way and to accept the dynamic of questioning as an energy moving him toward God. Appreciating the "Confessions" as a story of "learning to ask questions" illuminates not only the work's content but also its structure, most notably the odd change of tone and topic from books 1-9 to books 10-13.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses a recently completed research project, to answer the question, on what were the findings based? It draws on the hermeneutics of Gadamer to explore the relationship between researcher and research subject in qualitative educational research. It argues that all qualitative research findings are simultaneously subjective and objective, being essentially constructed interpretations of data which are partly, but only partly, external to the researcher. Yet many contemporary educational researchers tend to focus almost exclusively on either the subject matter under investigation or upon the standpoint of the researcher him/herself. A simultaneous combination of both is necessary to understand the nature of research findings.<br>

Issue: i308720<br>
Date: 4 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Jonsson Christer<br>
Abstract: Several recent studies of Soviet foreign policy formation have sought to bring organizational and cognitive considerations to bear on the subject. The article evaluates these perspectives and suggests how future research may, through the use of cognitive methods of analysis, distinguish formally between different conceptualizations of Soviet foreign policy formation, thus permitting a more rigorous empirical examination of the organizational issues involved. A model of inference that accounts for organizational and cognitive links between the Soviet press and Soviet foreign policy formation is also constructed; examples are drawn from the items under review. In conclusion, the article outlines a research strategy for cumulating knowledge about how the Soviet system works, and specifies what the organizational and cognitive frameworks for the study of Soviet foreign policy formation may contribute to such a project.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Schielke Samuli<br>
Abstract: In late 19th century, Islamic saints-day festivals ("mawlids") became the subject of strong criticism. A festive tradition that until then had been central to the religious and communal life of Egypt was now increasingly criticised for being backward and un-Islamic. "Mawlids", popular festivals that combine the atmosphere of a fair with the ecstatic spirituality of Sufism, were not only problematic for the new models of nation and religion, criticising them was also functional for the demarcation of these. Constructs of this type are characteristic for the project of modernity that is defined through binary distinctions, with labels such as 'backwardness' and 'un-Islamic innovations' serving as distinctive markers of modernity and authenticity. This development was not a consequent continuation of an earlier Islamic tradition, nor was it a simple takeover of European colonial concepts and disciplining practices. It was the product of a creative and selective synthesis of the two, producing novel interpretations of both Islam and modernity that, in the course of the 20th century, have managed to gain a hegemonic position in much of the Middle East. This emergence of Islamic reformism and modernism from a synthesis with colonial discourses compels us to rethink a currently popular endeavour in Islamic studies: the study of Islam as a discursive tradition.<br>

Abstract: È importante chiarire che "postmodernismo" è un termine vago, controverso e troppo
ampio per significare una posizione precisa; sotto tale etichetta si sogliono designare cose
tanto diverse quanto il periodo seguente al "modernismo" (avente come inizio per alcuni
il secondo dopoguerra e per altri gli anni '6o del secolo scorso) quanto i prodotti culturali
delle società a capitalismo avanzato. Si veda per esempio J.-F. Lyotard, La condition postmo-
derne: rapport sul le savoir, Paris 1979; J. Habermas, 'Modernity- and Incomplete Project',
New German Critique 22, 1981, pp. 3-14, e per un inquadramento generale T. Docherty (ed.),
Postmodernism: a Reader, New York 1993. Viceversa sarebbe corretto parlare di "poststrut-
turalismo" in riferimento all'atteggiamento teorico di critica alle categorie intellettuali
tradizionali che nasce come reazione allo strutturalismo e come sua trasformazione; si
comprenderà qui tanto la pratica critica e teorica dell'antropologia di Clifford Geertz (con
l'enfasi posta sul concetto di "locale" e "particolare" in opposizione a "universale" e "ge-
nerale"), quanto quella letteraria del decostruzionismo di Jacques Derrida e Julia Kristeva,
o a posizioni critiche diversificate, da Roland Barthes a Michel Foucault. Cfr. per la critica
letteraria in particolare R. Young (ed.), Untying the Text: a Post-Structuralist Reader, Boston
1981. Ma anche nel caso del termine "poststrutturalismo", l'ampiezza eccessiva delle posi-
zioni designate finisce a mio avviso con il risultare un ostacolo alla comprensione piuttosto
che uno strumento di chiarezza.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott Bede<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Abstract: Notwithstanding the growing use of interpretive analysis in public administration and policy research, its fullest potential for evaluating intractable public conflict has yet to be tapped. We develop a mode of narrative analysis, partly based upon Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, that shows promise for analyzing public disputes. We illustrate this with a case study in Los Angeles involving a contentious proposal to inject recycled wastewater into the city's water supply. The analysis reveals that, by representing opposing interests with a simplistic narrative, the water industry's response has been superfluous. The latter assumes that impasse simply results from the public's lack of information, the logical response being an information dissemination campaign. We employ a hermeneutic approach to reveal a set of persistent issues that project proponents have hitherto failed to address. By respecting the inherent plurivocity and intertextuality of narrative, hermeneutics provides new inroads into controversial public issues. We close the discussion with implications for practice.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

D'abord, s'agit-il d'une nouvelle branche de la géographie ou d'une école de pensée qui prétend réorganiser l'ensemble des savoirs de la discipline? Le projet d'une géographie culturelle reprend et endosse les ambiguïtés du mot « culture » dans les sciences sociales contemporaines. Ensuite, le mot « culture » correspond le plus souvent à une version faible de la notion de société, en particulier dans les travaux anglophones. Cette géographie, qui aborde les sociétés sans le dire clairement, a-t-elle forgé de nouveaux outils pour explorer la dimension spatiale de ces sociétés? Si le « tournant culturel » a certainement contribué à faire avancer notre regard sur le monde social dans certains domaines, la réponse à cette question n'est pas toujours consistante. Au bout du compte, deux caractéristiques, qui pouvaient paraître périphériques, se révèlent essentielles pour éclairer les logiques de ces hésitations. L'une, théorique, concerne la mise en place éventuelle d'un paradigme du social qui se passerait d'un concept de société. L'autre, effet pratique du premier, concerne l'usage de discours universitaires prétendant fonder le « multiculturalisme » sur le respect des « cultures » pour légitimer le communautarisme contre la « société des individus ». Cultural geography proposes an apparently innovative project but it actually raises a dual epistemological issue. First of all, is it a new field inside geography or a school of thought that contends to redesign the overall geography's disciplinary layout? The perspective of a "cultural geography" encompasses and endorses the ambiguity of the word "culture" in contemporary social sciences. Secondly, "culture" is predominantly used as a weak version of "society", namely in English-speaking literature. Cultural geographers address societies but do not explicitly admit it. Have cultural geographers built fresh tools to e~<br>

Abstract: Jean Ladrière, professeur à l'Université Catholique de Louvain, a développé une réflexion consacrée à la distinction et aux relations de la science et de la philosophie au point de vue épistémologique et ontologique, c'est-à-dire de la vérité. L'article parcourt trois de ses textes, écrits au long d'un demi siècle. La phénoménologie anime de plus en plus la réflexion, lui permettant de recentrer la dynamique de la science en un projet fondamental. Les vérités scientifiques et leur relativité historique sont à comprendre intérieurement à la pratique de la science, dont le philosophe médite le sens en prenant la responsabilité d'en révéler la vérité. L'évolution de la pensée de Ladrière illustre l'évolution de l'université de Louvain qui, fleuron du thomisme restauré par Léon XIII, s'est orienté de plus en plus vers la phénoménologie à l'époque de l'enseignement de notre auteur. Jean Ladrière, professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, developed a reflection on the distinction and relations between science and philosophy from the point of view of epistemology and ontology, i. e. from the point of view of truth. The article considers three of his texts, which span a 50-year period. The increasing influence of phenomenology on his reflection allows Ladrière to re-locate the dynamic of science in a fundamental project. The truths of science, and their historic relativity, are to be understood as belonging within the practice of science, while it is the task of philosophy to reflect on its meaning, by revealing its truth. The evolution of Ladrière's thought illustrates the evolution of the university of Louvain, which, from being a centre of the Thomism which was reinstated under Leo XIII, adopted a progressively more phenomenological orientation during our author's time as a teacher there.<br>

Abstract: L'article aborde la question de l'universalisation que l'on attend du processus actuel de mondialisation, qui unifie la planète sur la base de l'économie du marché. Sous la poussée de la rationalité scientifique, la mondialisation réalise une universalisation de moyens susceptibles d'ouvrir potentiellement à toute l'humanité l'accès à des biens élémentaires qui améliorent son bien-être en libérant du besoin. On remarque toutefois que, sous l'influence de l'idéologie néolibérale, la prédominance de la dimension économique invertit la mondialisation en un projet instrumental de la part de ceux qui considèrent toute réalité, y compris l'homme, comme un moyen. La mondialisation produit ainsi une universalisation rationnelle qui concerne les choses ou les moyens, et non les hommes. Loin donc de réaliser la véritable universalisation de l'humanité, elle en pose tout au plus les conditions matérielles d'avènement et laisse de côté le problème crucial de la reconnaissance de l'homme par l'homme. The article addresses the question of the universalisation that can be expected from the current process of globalisation, which unifies the planet on the basis of the market economy. Propelled by scientific rationality, globalisation is producing a universalisation of resources that has the potential of providing all of humanity access to those basic goods which increase wellbeing by eliminating need. Nonetheless, it is observed that, under the influence of neoliberal ideology, the predominance of the economic dimension transforms globalisation into a project used by those who consider all reality, including human beings, as a means. Globalisation thus produces a rational universalisation that impacts things and resources but not human beings. Far from bringing about a true universalisation of humanity, globalisation at the most sets the material conditions of access but leaves to the side the crucial problem of the mutual recognition of man for man.<br>

Abstract: Le lien entre pensée philosophique et pensée juive chez Hermann Cohen se confond avec son concept de raison ou de rationalité. Dès ses premiers travaux, il s'attache à éprouver la dimension universaliste de la tradition juive. Or la rationalit/e du judaïsme réside, selon lui, dans l'idée d'une morale universelle, qui se manifeste avant tout dans la pensée messianique. Ce lien apparaît le plus clairement dans les écrits qui font converger le judaïsme et la philosophie kantienne dans l'horizon de la raison. Sous l'aspect de la philosophie pratique, cette convergence rejoint le projet politique de l'assimilation du judaïsme et de la culture allemande. The link between philosophical reflexion an Jewish thought in Hermann Cohen is thoroughly determined by his concept of reason or rationality. Since his earlier works Cohen tries to show the universalistic dimension of Jewish tradition. Now the rationality of Judaism lies in its universal morality, which is inherent to the perspective of messianism. This appears clearly in those works where Cohen brings together Judaism and Kantian philosophy with regard to the idea of reason. In the field of practical philosophy such a convergency is part of the political project of assimilation between Judaism and German culture.<br>

Abstract: Quentin Skinner's methodological project contains a fundamental imprecision that is rarely mentioned by the secondary literature: the assumption, present in several of his methodological texts, that a theory designed for the analysis of oral communication (speech act theory) can be unreservedly used for interpreting text. In this article I will use some of Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological insights on the difference between textual and oral communication in order to advance a systematic critique of Skinner's project and to suggest new methodological possibilities for the history of political thought and related disciplines. This procedure will also allow me to organize some of the criticism raised against Skinner's Collingwoodean approach since its inception.<br>

Abstract: Para evitar la mercantilización de la academia sin renunciar a los beneficios de un intercambio sistemático entre la Universidad y el mercado, es fundamental construir zonas de intercambio entre las dos esferas. Diferentes perspectivas teóricas pueden guiar ese proceso de construcción. Sin embargo, los enfoques actuales no permiten explicar por qué, en presencia de las mismas estructuras y culturas, unas zonas de intercambio son a veces percibidas como ejercicios auténticamente no hegemónicos de contacto entre la Universidad y el mercado, y a veces no. Para explicar ese fenómeno es necesario abordar la construcción de zonas de intercambio como performance social y analizarla desde la pragmática cultural. Este trabajo introducirá esa aproximación con referencia a la reciente construcción de una zona de intercambio entre la Universidad y el mercado en la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, que se dio mediante un proyecto llamado Catella. Areas for exchange between universities and the market must be constructed to avoid mercantilising the academic world without renouncing the benefits of a systematic exchange between both spheres. Different theoretical viewpoints could guide the construction process. However, current approaches do not explain why (in the presence of the same structures and cultures) some areas of exchange are sometimes perceived as being authentically non-hegemonic exercises in contact between the university and the market and sometimes no so. Areas for exchange must thus be constructed (such as social performance) for explaining this phenomenon and analyse it from cultural pragmatics. This work introduces such an approach, referring to the recent construction of an area for exchange between the university and the market in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia via a project named "Catella". Pour éviter la mercantilisation de l'académie sans renoncer aux bénéfices d'un échange systématique entre l'université et le marché, il est fondamental de construire~<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Author(s): Westerink Herman<br>
Abstract: In this article it is argued that the apparent vagueness and broadness of the concept 'spirituality' and the difficulty in finding an agreeable definition for it are related to the different meanings of the concept within different intellectual and religious contexts and, subsequently, to different valuations of spirituality in relation to religion and lived religiosity. This article also examines the concept spirituality in the context of the psychology of religion's historical entanglement with theology. On the one hand, the psychology of religion has emancipated itself from theological discourse and theological institutions. On the other hand, the psychology of religion is still closely connected to a modernist theological project of founding religiousness in a province of the mind that resists religious critique of traditional contents and institutional structures in a secular era. The author pleas for more differentiation between theistic and non-theistic dimensions of the concept spirituality.<br>

Abstract: Von der deutschen Politikwissenschaft fast unbemerkt, hat sich im angelsächsischen Sprachraum unter dem Einfluß der auch als Cambridge School bezeichneten Gruppe von Historikern und Politikwissenschaftlern um J.G.A. Pocock und Quentin Skinner eine umfassende Neuorientierung auf dem Gebiet der Ideengeschichte vollzogen. Indem die Cambridge School im Bemühen um methodologische Klarheit ein dezidiertes, theoretisch fundiertes Bild von Natur und Status des politischen Denkens entwickelt, beeinflußt sie zwangsläufig auch die zeitgenössische Gesellschaftstheorie und Metatheorie. Dieser Zusammenhang soll hier aufgezeigt werden. Dazu werden die individuellen Ansätze Pococks und Skinners ebenso vorgestellt und diskutiert wie das von beiden beeinflußte Projekt einer kritischen Begriffsgeschichte, welches die Verbindung zwischen Ideengeschichte und Metatheorie in besonderem Maße deutlich werden läßt. The recent development in the History of Ideas, attributable to writers like J.G.A. Pocock or Quentin Skinner, who are frequently referred to as Cambridge School, has almost gone unnoticed in German speaking countries. In their search for methodological clarity, it is argued, these writers present a distinct account of the nature and status of political theories which necessarily influences contemporary social theory as well. To draw out this implication, the individual approaches of Pocock and Skinner are scrutinized and subsequently the project of a Critical Conceptual History, which is influenced by the Cambridge School, will be considered as well. In the course of the argument the bearing of the Cambridge School's ideas on present concerns in social theory will be made clear.<br>

Abstract: Son ya varias las décodas transcurridas desde que los estudios de folklore en general y la etnomusicología en particular se han visto dominados por la analitica deconstructiva y el pensamiento culturalista, configurando un bloque paradigmático sumamente influyente en el multidisciplinar territorio de las ciencias sociales. Las aportaciones provenientes de estas corrientes han resultado en líneas generates de gran valor e interés para la comunidad científica, ensanchando y dinamizando el hasta entonces relativamente reducido campo de acción e interpretación de disciplinas como la musicología comparada. Sin embargo el proceso de renovación académica –que encabezarían obras como las de Benedict Anderson y Eric Hobsbawm– ha implicado asimismo un desigual desplazamiento del foco de atención desde el objeto de estudio mismo hacia la esfera de su contexto, relevancia social e implicaciones ideológicas. La deconstrucción se ha ejercido particularmente en contra del aserto diferencial, subrayando sus debilidades argumentales, excesos etnocéntricos y –con frecuencia– obvios intereses espurios, una tarea históricamente necesaria pero que a la par ha sustraído del folklore todo valor ontológico en aras de su significado, y del trabajo científico el vital soporte empírico, que ahora se ve arrinconado por una elaboración altamente abstracta al amparo de un lenguaje en el límite de la saturación semántica. Este artículo explora la vía crítica descrita para concluir planteando determinadas alternativas en defensa de una tradición sostenible –a pesar del vigor innegable y sinergético de las fuerzas del progreso, los procesos de hibridación y globalización y las alteraciones provenientes del constructo folklorista–, así como del hecho diferencial implícito y su asunción y gestión no indefectiblemente en el marco de un proyecto político o comercial. Studies of folklore in general and ethnomusicology in particular have been dominated by deconstructive analysis and culturalist theory fo~<br>

Abstract: Après l'évocation de la longue gestation du MiR, l'auteure passe en revue la collection permanente et ses multiples aménagements depuis l'ouverture de ce lieu muséal en 2005, primé en 2007 par le Conseil de l'Europe. Elle aborde ensuite les questions essentielles engendrées par l'existence de ce lieu: celle des conditions d'exposition du patrimoine immatériel, celle des deux écueils fondamentaux liés à la démarche muséale – l'identité et la mémoire – et enfin celle du sens même d'un musée protestant. After summarizing the long gestation of the International Reformation Museum, the author describes the permanent collection and its numerous modifications since the opening in 2005 of the museum, which was awarded the prize of the Council of Europe in 2007. She then discusses some essential questions stemming from the existence of this centre: how to present an exhibition of a non-physical heritage; how to avoid the two basic problems inherent in any museum project – identity and memory; finally the very meaning of a Protestant museum. Nach einem Überblick über die lange Entstehungsgeschichte des Internationale Reformationsmuseum stellt die Verfasserin die Dauerausstellung mit ihren wiederholten Umgestaltungen seit der Eröffnung des Museums im Jahre 2005 und seiner 2007 erfolgten Auszeichnung durch den Europarat vor. Anschließend geht sie den grundlegenden Fragen nach, die sich aus der Existenz einer solchen Einrichtung ergeben: der Frage nach den Sachzwängen einer Austellung immateriellen Kulturerbes, der Frage nach den zwei hauptsächlichen Schwierigkeiten, die jedes museale Projekt meistern muß, nämlich Identität und Erinnerung in Einklang zu bringen, und schließlich der Frage nach dem eigentlichen Sinn und Zweck eines protestantischen Museums.<br>

Abstract: Faire appel à la notion de crimes contre les générations futures est assurément la marque de la progression d'une nouvelle conscience de responsabilité envers l'avenir, la condition humaine future, les autres espèces vivantes et l'environnement. Elle contribue à un changement de paradigme temporel déjà en marche aussi spécifique que nécessaire à notre temps. Reflet d'un nouvel imaginaire international, le projet de formalisation de crimes contre les générations futures recèle des potentialités de transformations inédites et puissantes sur le champ juridique. En prenant appui sur les théories éthiques de la responsabilité transgénérationnelle, il est permis de fournir un éclairage spécifique de la notion de crimes contre les générations futures. Des affinements théoriques peuvent s'avérer nécessaires en considération du contexte de connaissances. C'est une véritable conversion intellectuelle qui se profile avec l'admission d'un principe de non-discrimination temporelle en vertu duquel l'absence d'existence temporelle ne serait plus synonyme d'absence de droits ni de garantie juridique. Une complexification des logiques juridiques pour la mise en œuvre des crimes contre les générations futures est alors imaginable. Formuler des crimes contre les générations futures est également maïeutique en ce qu'ils appellent dans leur sillage la consécration d'un principe de dignité des générations futures. Un tel principe insufflerait une dynamique de recomposition du droit des droits de l'homme en l'ouvrant à la perspective transgénérationnelle. Des perspectives prospectives pour la notion de crimes contre les générations futures sont ouvertes avec l'idée d'intégrer également la protection de la condition humaine future. Quelques mises en garde prospectives sont formulées. Evoking the notion of crimes against future generations is certainly an indication of the development of a new awareness regarding accountability for the future of human, other living species and the environme~<br>

Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas' earliest development of thought is presented here as a phenomenological endeavor, i.e. in its relation to Husserl and Heidegger as well as in its own effort to give an appropriate philosophical account of ‚things themselves‘. The latter task is shown to have a transcendental dimension as it is a self-awareness of conscious life in which the faithful analysis of concrete phenomena and the concept of this life itself have to be brought into attunement. The perspective of Levinas' phenomenological gaze is then presented in these terms and shows two fairly distinct stages. Up to the mid-1930s Levinas appears as a follower of Martin Heidegger, when he advocates an appropriate approach to being in all its richness and therefore criticizes Husserl's alleged intellectualism. Later, with a radicalized perspective, Levinas' own philosophical project advocates an appropriate account of the problem of radical alterity beyond experience and phenomenology. He therefore criticizes both Husserl and Heidegger and remodels phenomenology so that it can adequately ‚understand‘ radical alterity and at the same time confine itself before it.<br>

Abstract: La Modernidad parecía condenar a la expulsión de la religión respecto del proyecto ilustrado al considerar que fe y razón eran excluyentes. No obstante, esa promesa de futuro de emancipación y de racionalidad ilustrada ha incurrido en sus propios aspectos negativos, hasta llegar, en la postmodernidad, a la deconstrucción de todo y la pérdida de sentido. El filósofo Habermas y el teólogo Ratzinger, después Papa Benedicto XVI, debatieron el papel que razón y fe debían desempeñar en las actuales sociedades plurales. Ambos partían de premisas distintas –Habermas desde la confianza en la Ilustración y en la religión como humanismo y Ratzinger desde el necesario entendimiento entre fe y razón– para llegar a un punto de encuentro: la necesidad de defender una nueva Ilustración, compatible con la religión, para operar en la postmodernidad. Modernity seemed to replace religion with the Enlightenment project, since it considered that reason and faith were mutually exclusive. However, the promise of a future of emancipation and Enlightenment reason has finally culminated, in Postmodernity, in the destruction of everything and the loss of meaning. Habermas, philosopher, and Ratzinger, theologian and later Pope Benedict XVI, discussed the role that ought to be played by reason and faith in the current plural societies. They were based on different premises—Habermas on trust in the Enlightenment and in religion from a humanistic perspective and Ratzinger on the necessary understanding between faith and reason—and reached a common point: the need to defend a new Enlightenment, compatible with religion, which can operate in Postmodernity.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I take issue with Heidegger's use of the concept of death as a means of disclosing human finitude. I argue that Being-towards-death is inadequate to the disclosure of Dasein's thrownness which is necessary for the kind of authentic historizing that Heidegger describes and furthermore leads to a reading of authenticity which is preclusive of Being-with-Others. I suggest that this difficulty may be alleviated through increased attention to the opposite boundary of Dasein's existence, namely its birth. Although I do not pursue the project here of conducting a phenomenology of birth, I suggest some directions for proceeding with that task, and I illustrate that a greater emphasis on Dasein's beginning will increase the richness of our understanding of our Being-with-Others.<br>

Abstract: All humans by nature desire to know and humans are distinguished from the rest of creation by the miracle of knowledge. If all cultures have developed their own forms of knowledge, the spectacular success of a certain form of knowledge, science, notably in the west, has frequently led to its being exclusively attributed to the west. Yet science remains only one of many forms of knowledge and the west only one of its producers. The success of the west has tended to marginalize other forms of knowledge and other contributions to knowledge and, thus to impoverish an otherwise potentially rich and complex world knowledge landscape. It has tended to inhibit or even prevent the development of a really universal, human-knowledge project. Its very success, due essentially to its sustained application to technology, has enabled the development of a false superiority over other forms of knowledge and a real power hegemony of the west over other peoples. The future of lasting peaceful co-existence in the world may depend, in part, on the emancipation of other knowledge modes and forms. De par leur nature, tous les êtres humains éprouvent le désir de savoir, et les humains se distinguent des autres êtres de la Création par le miracle de la connaissance. Bien que toutes les cultures aient développé leurs propres formes de connaissance, le succès spectaculaire, notamment en Europe, d'une forme particulière de la connaissance, la science, a fait que cette dernière a été exclusivement attribuée à l'Occident. Pourtant, la science ne représente qu'une des nombreuses formes de la connaissance et l'Occident n'est qu'un producteur de celle-ci, parmi tant d'autres. Le succès de l'Occident a contribué à marginaliser les autres formes de connaissance et autres contributions à la connaissance, et ainsi, a fini par appauvrir le paysage international de la connaissance, qui autrement, aurait pu être extrêmement riche et diversifié. Ce succès de l'Occident a fini par inhiber, voire empêcher le~<br>

Abstract: Este artículo tiene por objetivo presentar una estrategia metodológica para el estudio de las urbanizaciones cerradas que se centre en la mirada de los actores sociales involucrados, teniendo en cuenta las representaciones sociales y las percepciones que sustentan. Dicha estrategia se enmarca en una investigación cualitativa que permite reconstruir teóricamente un objeto en permanente dinamismo y obtener una comprensión holística de las situaciones sociales; propone para su desarrollo la utilización de un enfoque etnográfico, en tanto la etnografía es una modalidad de investigación que favorece la comprensión de los procesos sociales. This article seeks to present a methodological approach to the study of gated communities in order to focus on the perspective of the actors involved, taking into account the social representations and perceptions those supports. This strategy is part of a qualitative research project that enables one to theoretically reconstruct an object in constant dynamism and obtain a holistic understanding of social situations. To this end, it proposes using an ethnographic approach, since ethnography is a form of research that promotes the understanding of social processes.<br>

Abstract: This paper traces the development of the historical origins of an economic ethos and the groups that carried and transformed this ethos in two key economic sectors: first, Silicon Valley, and second, Wall Street. Financialization of the US economy is closely connected to a political logic that celebrated the capacity for the self-regulation of markets and condemned state intervention, bringing free-market thought to the fore. A growing body of sociological literature explains the rise of neoliberalism as an intellectual project, as a series of policy reforms, and as a form of politics. This dialogue has largely lacked sufficient critical analysis of whether a motivating ethos allowed market fundamentalism to emerge and take hold across different economic sectors. An analysis of the resurgence of free-market ideas in two important sectors of the US economy, informed by Weberian theory, reveals a distinct element, in this case an ethos, which itself motivates and sustains free-market thinking. In Silicon Valley and on Wall Street an economic ethos emerged from the structuring of ideas and ethics into specific historical contexts by distinct groups within each economic sector.<br>

Author(s): WATSON STEPHEN H.<br>
Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i24672910<br>
Date: 9 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Mazurel Hervé<br>
Abstract: L'histoire des sensibilités suscite encore une méfiance persistante, avant tout parce que son projet intellectuel demeure mal identifié, parce que l'historiographie a souvent laissé penser que ses origines s'ancraient uniquement dans la continuité du projet de Lucien Febvre et de l'histoire des mentalités à la française. Or, en vérité, celle-ci n'est autre que la traduction historiographique d'un mouvement philosophique beaucoup plus ample et ancien, né du basculement incarné par Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche et Sigmund Freud, ces penseurs du soupçon, qui nous ont appris à repérer derrière les idées, la raison et la conscience, le rôle des désirs et des appétits, le jeu des pulsions et des sentiments. Rendant ainsi l'homme moins transparent à luimême, l'historien du sensible vise, outre à restituer l'historicité de notre vie sensible, à réévaluer la part des affects dans la détermination des conduites humaines. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie également sur la riche nébuleuse des savoirs critiques élaborés ensuite, dans l'Allemagne de la première moitié du 20e siècle, sous les appellations de « psychologie sociale » ou « historique » ou, à la manière nietzschéenne, de « psychologie des profondeurs ». The history of sensibility still continues to elicit suspicion, first and foremost because this intellectual project remains poorly defined, historiography often having led us to believe that its roots stemmed solely from Lucien Febvre's endeavours and the French history of mentalities. And yet in truth, the history of sensibility is nothing less than the historiographical translation of a much broader and older philosophical movement, born of the tipping point provoked by Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Those great sceptical thinkers taught us to unmask the role of desires, appetites and impulses behind our ideas, reason and consciousness. In addition to recreating the historicity of our lives of sensibility and thus rendering man less transparent to himse~<br>

Abstract: Cf. Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative (1985), translated by Kathleen Blamey and David
Pellauer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988) 3:184-85, 310 η.3· 1 am uncertain as
to precisely what Ricoeur implies with his statement: "What is surprising is that this inter-
lacing of fiction and history in no way undercuts the project of standing-for belonging to
history, but instead helps to realize it; 0:186). Giambattista Vico's fanciful division of
universal history into four periods, associated with the tropes of metaphor, synecdoche,
metonymy, and irony (in Scienze Nuova (1744, third édition), par. 400-411), is the
apparent source of this peculiar categorial framework adopted by Kenneth Burke and
(altered) Northrop Frye. Hayden White claims these tropes are the 'transformational
system built into Foucault's conception of the succession of forms of the human sciences,
even though Foucault appears not to know that it is there.'! Cf. Hayden V. White, 'Foucault
Decoded: Notes from Underground', in History and Theory 12 (1973): 45. This judgment
may apply to Hayden White himself.<br>

Issue: i24715391<br>
Date: 1 1, 2015<br>
Author(s): Vuilleumier Victor<br>
Abstract: Le corps chez Lu Xun est peu décrit. Cette absence permet de dire indirectement une souffrance multiple : la honte ressentie devant la crise historique de la Chine dont la nature nationale est tenue pour responsable; la mélancolie existentielle. En revanche, le corps est allégorisé comme signe de la tradition, qui fait obstacle à l'émancipation de l'individu. Libérer la voix de la nation chinoise impose de détruire symboliquement le corps reçu en héritage, de subvertir l'esthétique et les paradigmes scientistes de la corporalité et de la puissance élaborés par la modernité chinoise mondialisée. Le vrai médecin agit par l'écrit sur l'esprit, non sur le corps ou la civilisation matérielle. Accorder la primauté au cœur sur le corps permet de fonder un projet de modernité, en métaphorisant la médecine importée. The body in Lu Xun's writings is rarely depicted. This absence allows the text to indirectly express the meaning of suffering in its multiple dimension (the shame felt in the face of China's historical crisis, which the national nature is held liable for, and the existential melancholy). However, the body is allegorized, and embodies the sign of a tradition that limits the emancipation of the individual. The liberation of the Chinese national voice requires symbolically destroying the inherited body, as well as subverting the sublime aesthetics of corporeality and the scientist paradigm of the body defined by the Chinese globalized modernity. The real physician impacts on the spirit by means of the writing, and not on the body or the material civilization. To ensure a greatest value to the heart rather than to the body is regarded by Lu Xun as a way to establish a project of modernity, by the metaphorization of the imported medicine. 在魯迅作品里，很少描寫身體。這種缺席可以有助於用非直接的方式來言說一種多 重的苦痛（包含在中國的歷史危機面前所體會到的羞恥感，中國人的國民性被認為 是要對這種危機負責，也包含存在的苦悶）。相反，身體被加以寓言化，成為傳統 符號的寓言，阻礙個體的解放。解放中國民族的聲音，迫使要用象徵的方式摧毀作 為遺產來接受的身體，顛覆既有的美學観，亦顛覆由經歷世界化的中國現代性所建 構出的體魄與力量的科學主義範式。真正的醫生通過書寫的形式對精神加以作用， 而不是針對身體或者物質~<br>

Abstract: The citizenship of the Hermeneutic Philosophy surpasses multicultural proposals. It detects the lack of pre-philosophic solutions: cosmopolitan, republican citizenship, communitarian and liberal. As a consequence, it assumes and fuses equalities and differences in a project. It establishes the merging of four key horizons: the sense of belonging to a community; an agreement in rights and obligations of an identifier project; the right to take part in politics (to be co-legislators), and the validation of a right according to interests. In consequence, it gives the right of opportunity over the right of possession; making the strange our own. This citizenship reaches, by hermeneutic empathy, each one to grant him the subsidiary of a categorical right. It is an invitation to treat others as you would yourself.<br>

Abstract: The Cold War International History Project, housed at the Woodrow Wilson Interna-
tional Center in Washington, DC, has cosponsored three major conferences on the origins of
the Cold War during the last two years. The papers given were based on the newly accessible
materials in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Germany. In my view, the papers underscore the
difficulty of making any clear-cut generalizations about the motives and objectives of the Soviet
Union. These papers may be obtained from Jim Hershberg, the director of the Cold War
International History Project. The emerging literature on the Korean War based on Russian,
Chinese, and Korean sources also underscores that new archival evidence will not resolve old
controversies but will enrich them and direct them along new and interesting lines. See, for
example, Bruce Cumings, Roaring of the Cataract; Shu Guang Zhang, Deterrence and Strategic
Culture: Chinese-American Confrontations, tiyqg-iyyH (Ithaca, 1992); Goncharov, Lewis, and

Abstract: La place de la musique dans À la recherche du temps perdu a suscité nombre de commentaires. Le présent propos connecte ces points à un débat interne aux musicologues français. Si certains l'envisage contre toute interpretation subjective, d'autres entendent la recentrer sur deux axes majeurs: 1) le statut d'écrit littéraire 2) révélant l'expérience musicale d'autre part. Or, de récents articles insèrent Proust à ce débat. Il s'agit de comprendre en quoi réactualiser écrivain ayant fait d'un roman un projet esthétique où la question du langage est centrale peut relancer la discussion du lien musique-langage, ici en un rapport où s'adjoint la musicologie, elle-même objet d'une dissension. /// The work À la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust has provoked numerous commentaries which referred to the importance conferred upon music in this novel. In this, interest was pointed either at the music sources, the listening, or the connections between the architecture of the novel and the musical structure of the composer Vinteuil, the character in the novel. This article offers the articulation of those debates which occur within the French musicology which question its objects in the way that some consider it as a science or discipline at intersection of others, which has to return necessarily within sciences called exact and/or humane, opposed to all subjective interpretations; the other try to center again musicologist's activities in two main axes: the status of a writing with a literary aspiration on one side, and a report about musical experience on the other. In this, recent articles were putting Marcel Proust in the focus of a contemporary debate, trying to understand in which way the reactualisation of a writer - who out of one work had made an aesthetical project in which the question of language became central - can renew the discussion about connections between music and language, but this time within a triangular connection in which musicology is added, whi~<br>

Abstract: El ensayo explora la dimensión cultural de la experiencia misionera de los jesuitas en China durante la primera edad moderna y analiza en particular la relación entre evangelización y escritura. Es a nivel de la cultural civility que el misionero jesuita logra identificarse con el "hombre de letras" chino. Es a nivel de la bibliofilia, del coleccionismo, de la exégesis y del bricolaje como jesuitas italianos y literatos chinos podrán entrar en diálogo. Los primeros, adoptando la definición de "letrados europeos", resaltan la intrínseca afinidad con los otros, los wenren 文人. Los libros representan el aspecto más significativo del encuentro entre estos dos grupos humanos. Interactuando con la élite política e intelectual china, los jesuitas intentaron poner en práctica un programa educativo basado en el modelo de los collegia de la Compañía en Europa. El proyecto nunca fue puesto en marcha, pero mediante la producción de libros para y sobre China, los jesuitas contribuyeron a insertarla en un proyecto universal de circulación de saberes. /// This essay explores the cultural dimension of the Jesuit missionary experience in China during the early modern period while focusing on the particular relationship between evangelization and writing. Jesuit missionaries identified with Chinese intelligentsia by means of their cultural civility and managed to dialogue with them on the basis of book and art collecting, exegesis and bricolage. Defining themselves as "European literati", the Jesuits showed an intellectual affinity with the Chinese wenren 文人. Books represent the most significant aspect of the encounter between these two human groups.

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i25654803<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Passos José Luiz<br>
Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i25677409<br>
Date: 6 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Kelty Christopher<br>
Abstract: In this paper we argue that the concept and practice of responsibility is being transformed within science and engineering. It tells the story of attempts by nanotechnologists to make responsibility 'do-able' and calculable in a setting where the established language and tools of risk and risk analysis are seen as inadequate. The research is based on ethnographic participant-observation at the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) at Rice University in Texas, during the period 2003 to 2007, including the controversies and public discussions it was engaged in and the creation of the International Council on Nanotechnology (ICON). CBEN began as a project to study 'applications' of nanotechnology to environmental and biological systems, but turned immediately to the study of 'implications' to biology and environment. We argue here that the notion of 'implications' and the language of risk employed early on addressed two separate but entangled ideas: the risks that nanomaterials pose to biology and environment, and the risks that research on this area poses to the health of nanotechnology itself. Practitioners at CBEN sought ways to accept responsibility both as scientists with a duty to protect science (from the public, from de-funding, from 'backlash') and as citizens with a responsibility to protect the environment and biology through scientific research. Ultimately, the language of risk has failed, and in its place ideas about responsibility, prudence, and accountability for the future have emerged, along with new questions about the proper venues and 'modes of veridiction' by which claims about safety or responsibility might be scientifically adjudicated.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo ofrece aportes para un balance de uno de los más ambiciosos y debatidos proyectos de antropología aplicada en América Latina, el Proyecto Perú-Cornell, que se desarrolló en la Comunidad de Vicos, en los Andes peruanos, entre 1952 y 1966. Lo más valioso de estos aportes es que son fruto del trabajo con los propios pobladores de Vicos, que durante un año se embarcaron en un intenso proceso reflexión y diálogo intergeneracional en el marco de una investigación participativa enfocada en las memorias locales del pasado comunal, y las implicancias de ese pasado para el presente y futuro de Vicos. Además de presentar a la Comunidad de Vicos, los antecedentes del Proyecto Perú-Cornell y el marco teórico y metodológico del proyecto de investigación participativa, este artículo ofrece una selección de testimonios de los pobladores de Vicos así como algunas reflexiones a modo de conclusión. Particularmente, destaca el potencial de los procesos colectivos de reflexión sobre el pasado como mecanismos de consolidación de la identidad y subraya la importancia de incluir a los actores locales en la reflexión y análisis de su pasado, no como «datos» o testimonios aislados, sino como productores de sentidos sobre ese pasado.

Abstract: El presente artículo proporciona una lectura actualizada de las llamadas 'novelas históricas' o 'novelas de ciudad' de Carlos Droguett. En particular, sus novelas centradas en la conquista y fundación de la ciudad de Santiago (100 gotas de sangre y 200 de sudor y Supay el cristiano) señalan la primera coordenada del proyecto narrativo droguettiano orientado a reelaborar y reescribir la historia chilena y latinoamericana, en una historiografía-literaria que busca sus fuentes, su prueba documental, en el enorme archivo conformado por toda esa sangre, por todas esas muertes soslayadas "con silencio o con ruido". 100 gotas de sangre y 200 de sudor y Supay el cristiano constituyen las primeras páginas de lo que aquí denominaremos "La Historia de Chile según Carlos Droguett". Pero, además, ambas novelas serían tributarias de la fuente documental previamente elaborada y narrativizada por el historiador Crescente Errázuriz en su Historia de Chile bajo Pedro de Valdivia. The present article provides an up-to-date reading of the so called 'historical novels' or 'city novels' by Carlos Droguett. In particular, his novels focused on the conquest and founding of the city of Santiago (100 Gotas de Sangre y 200 de Sudor and Supay el cristiano) mark the droguettian narrative project first's coordinate, oriented towards a remaking and rewriting of the Chilean and Latin American history, in a literary-historiography which looks for its sources, its documentary evidence, within the enormous archive conformed by all that blood, all those deaths eluded "with silence or noise". 100 Gotas de Sangre y 200 de Sudor and Supay el cristiano are the first pages of what we here call Chilean History according to Carlos Droguett. But, in addition, both novels would be tributary of the documentary source previously elaborated by the historian Crescente Errázuriz in his Historia de Chile bajo Pedro de Valdivia.<br>

Abstract: This article returns to research material initially gathered and used for an oral history project. Adopting a sociology of memory perspective, it analyses why and how the former internees at the annex camps of Drancy in Paris only rarely gave accounts of their internment to their families or in public. Following upon the work of Maurice Halbwachs, it studies the role of ties to groups and how they evolve over time in the expression of memories by the individuals concerned.<br>

Abstract: This paper deals with the manner of negotiating the relation to its colonial past of France in the Maghreb, concentrating on a key episode in the national historical account, the battle held to have taken place at Poitiers in 732. The creation, near Châtellerault, of a memorial site for that battle, and the annual commemoration which takes place there, constitute the substance of this paper, unfolding in three phases: firstly, an archeology of the genesis of the “Site of 732” situated in the context of the years from 1960 to 1970; secondly, an analysis of the contents of the site as seen through the typology of the discourses constructing the museum project; finally, clearly setting out the social issues involved in memorialisation, through observation and using the survey carried out on visitors to the site.<br>

Abstract: The benefits of increasing the contribution of the social sciences in the fields of environmental and conservation science disciplines are increasingly recognized. However, integration between the social and natural sciences has been limited, in part because of the barrier caused by major philosophical differences in the perspectives between these research areas. This paper aims to contribute to more effective interdisciplinary integration by explaining some of the philosophical views underpinning social research and how these views influence research methods and outcomes. We use a project investigating the motivation of volunteers working in an adaptive co-management project to eradicate American Mink from the Cairngorms National Park in Scotland as a case study to illustrate the impact of philosophical perspectives on research. Consideration of different perspectives promoted explicit reflection of the contributing researcher’s assumptions, and the implications of his or her perspectives on the outcomes of the research. We suggest a framework to assist conservation research projects by: (1) assisting formulation of research questions; (2) focusing dialogue between managers and researchers, making underlying worldviews explicit; and (3) helping researchers and managers improve longer-term strategies by helping identify overall goals and objectives and by identifying immediate research needs.<br>

Author(s): Smith Jonathan Z.<br>
Abstract: This essay makes explicit what lay behind the author's earlier casual observation that "Tillich remains the unacknowledged theoretician of our entire enterprise"—whether in the AAR or in North American studies of religion more generally. While the article does not make a narrowly (i.e., archivally verified) causal claim about Tillich's influence on the study of religion in the academy, it does point out three crucial roles Tillich's thought and practice played in the development of North American religious studies. (i) Tillich's understanding of religion as an "ultimate concern" provided a language deemed suitable to the new departments of religious studies in this country's higher education institutions (especially at state-run colleges and universities). (ii) Though not uniquely formative of the academy's longstanding discourse on symbolism, Tillich's interest in the symbol served as a legitimating vote of confidence about the worth of that discourse. Moreover, his understanding of the symbol (as that which "points to") ostensibly struck a balance between Eliade's onto-realistic and Geertz's more minimal fictive views of the symbol. (iii) Through his sustained interest in cultural institutions and products of cultural labor—more than through his theories about the relation between religion and culture (e.g., his method of correlation)—Tillich inspired the "dialogic fields" (e.g., Religion and Literature) and subsequent cultural and anthropological studies of religion. The author's earlier claim, then, was intended as a double critique: first, that the study of religion in secular public institutions should ground itself in a Protestant Christian theological project; second, that this influence should remain largely unacknowledged.<br>

Abstract: Manipulations of time, ranging between moments and centuries, pervade Rogier van der Weyden's Columba Altarpiece. They occur mainly among elements that have been considered forthright iconographic details or unremarkable scenery, including a cityscape, the star of the Magi, a figure among the Magi's followers, and a beggar. While several such temporal expressions find interpretive resonance in Scripture, patristic commentary, and sermons, their collaborative density in the altarpiece contrives a uniquely animated structure of meaning. Among unusual visual alignments that solicit exegetical attention from an observer, precisely charged relationships project backward and forward through history.<br>

Abstract: Computer-mediated communication (CMC) can spark students' interest and develop their cross-cultural communication skills. This article describes an on-going CMC cross-cultural project, "Images, Myths, and Realities across Cultures" (IMRAC), between French and American university students. The possibilities and limits of CMC are explored using the research of Claire Kramsch and Paul Ricœur, who provide a practical and theoretical framework in which to analyze student-authored writing. A three-fold articulation of self emerges as students participate in IMRAC. Through a process of mediation, the discussions on the chats offer students a praxis, a way of being that can contribute to making them more culturally literate citizens.<br>

Abstract: Nous tentons de clarifier la place de la normativité dans une approche phénoménologique du politique en analysant l'opposition de la philosophie des droits de l'homme d'inspiration kantienne de Luc Ferry et Alain Renaut à la réflexion de type phénoménologique de Claude Lefort. Le projet de Lefort consiste d'abord en une tentative d'élucidation du réel et non de justification de principes. Mais la dimension normative n'en demeure pas absente puisque Lefort conçoit les droits de l'homme tant comme un phénomène du politique que comme signes de la liberté qu'il recherche dans la démocratie. Y a-t-il là nécessairement incohérence? /// Can a phenomenological analysis of political reality tackle the issue of norms? We try to answer this question through an analysis of the opposition between Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut's Kantian philosophy of human rights and the phenomenological approach of Claude Lefort. Lefort's project is an attempt to elucidate reality and not to justify principles. But the normative dimension is not entirely absent from his thought. Lefort conceives of human rights not only as a political phenomenon but also as a sign of liberty, which he supports. Is this inconsistent with the nature of his phenomenological project?<br>

Author(s): Harrison Olivier<br>
Abstract: Le projet colemanien est de re-socialiser le choix rationnel, tout en maintenant des connexions micro-macro aussi opérationnelles qu'en économie. Le modèle général des Foundations soit rend compte des normes mais l'organisation sociale s'efface, soit remet celle-ci au premier plan (sous la forme réduite de la distribution du capital social) mais n'engendre plus assez de normes. Un travail parallèle de simulation donne à penser que le problème vient de la rationalité elle-même: simplement calculatoire, alors que seule une rationalité interprétative pourrait prendre en considération des objets collectifs. Ce changement exigerait que l'acteur rationnel eût accès à un langage moins sommaire: intensionnel et non plus extensionnel. /// Coleman's project is to resocialize rational choice while keeping micro-macro connections as operational as they are in economics. The general model of the Foundations either accounts for norms while effacing social organization, or highlights social organization (in the reduced form of social capital distribution) while failing to engender sufficient norms. A later simulation model suggests that the problem is intrinsic to calculative rationality: only with interpretive rationality can collective objects be taken into account. This shift would require the rational actor to speak in less cursory terms, to use intensional rather than extensional language. /// Colemans Absicht ist es, die rationale Wahl zu resozialisieren und gleichzeitig Verbindungen Mikro-Makro beizubehalten, die ebenso wirksam wären wie in der Wirtschaft. Das allgemeine Modell der Foundations erklärt entweder die Normen bei gleichzeitiger Vernachlässigung der sozialen Organisation, oder setzt die soziale Organisation in den Vordergrund (in der reduzierten Form der Verteilung des sozialen Kapitals) und verfügt damit nicht mehr über ausreichende Normen. Ein später entwickeltes Simulationsmodell läßt vermuten, daß das Problem aus der Rationalität selbst entsteht, das heißt ei~<br>

It is part of a larger project looking at the production and use of theories of teaching and learning mathematics. We outline the theoretical framework of our tool of analysis and discuss briefly some of the methodological difficulties we face. We then present our findings from the analysis of the journal and we also give one example of how we 'read' an article, illustrating the rules whereby criteria are applied.<br>

Article Title: Shades of Orientalism: Paradoxes and Problems in Indian Historiography<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i369544<br>
Date: 5 1, 1931<br>
Author(s): Tagore Peter<br>
Abstract: In Orientalism, Edward Said attempts to show that all European discourse about the Orient is the same, and all European scholars of the Orient complicit in the aims of European imperialism. There may be "manifest" differences in discourse, but the underlying "latent" orientalism is "more or less constant." This does not do justice to the marked differences in approach, attitude, presentation, and conclusions found in the works of various orientalists. I distinguish six different styles of colonial and postcolonial discourse about India (heuristic categories, not essential types), and note the existence of numerous precolonial discourses. I then examine the multiple ways exponents of these styles interact with one another by focusing on the early-twentieth-century nationalist orientalist, Sri Aurobindo. Aurobindo's thought took form in a colonial framework and has been used in various ways by postcolonial writers. An anti-British nationalist, he was by no means complicit in British imperialism. Neither can it be said, as some Saidians do, that the nationalist style of orientalism was just an imitative indigenous reversal of European discourse, using terms like "Hinduism" that had been invented by Europeans. Five problems that Aurobindo dealt with are still of interest to historians: the significance of the Vedas, the date of the vedic texts, the Aryan invasion theory, the Aryan-Dravidian distinction, and the idea that spirituality is the essence of India. His views on these topics have been criticized by Leftist and Saidian orientalists, and appropriated by reactionary "Hindutva" writers. Such critics concentrate on that portion of Aurobindo's work which stands in opposition to or supports their own views. A more balanced approach to the nationalist orientalism of Aurobindo and others would take account of their religious and political assumptions, but view their project as an attempt to create an alternative language of discourse. Although in need of criticism in th~<br>

Author(s): Waal Anne-Lise<br>
Abstract: This article looks at HIV prevention projects in which established stigmatized and stigmatizing roles were actively reversed and manipulated in pursuit of HIV harm reduction. In two Norwegian projects, sex workers and drug users carried out harm-reduction activities with other drug users and sex workers. Although HIV-related harm reduction was the aim of the projects, termination or reduction of drug use or sex work was not. Such changes nevertheless occurred among the sex workers and drug users who took active part in the project. The article considers these changes in order to reflect on the meanings and roles of participation in HIV prevention work. In particular, the discussion theorizes on possible ways in which alteration of roles and subject positions may produce self-reflective effects with transformative potentials.<br>

Author(s): Conan Jean-Jacques<br>
Abstract: Faut-il vraiment doubler désormais chaque haut lieu de mémoire par un "équipement d'interprétation" et d'accueil où s'opèrerait un "rattrapage de la mémoire par l'histoire"? La question hante sans aucun doute les collectivités locales, soucieuses aussi bien de "devoir de mémoire" que de rentabilité touristique. Elle est toujours actuelle, par exemple à Colombey à propos du général de Gaulle. Elle a été posée avec une intensité particulière à Oradour de 1993 à 1999. En voici la version personnelle d'un chef de projet qui là-bas tenta de gérer l'impossible, avant d'être remercié. En 1993, le conseil général de la Haute-Vienne a décidé la construction d'un équipement culturel d'accueil et d'information destiné à recevoir les visiteurs des ruines du village d'Oradour-sur-Glane martyrisé par la division SS "Das Reich" en juin 1944. Ce "Centre de la mémoire" fut inauguré en 1999 par le président de la République. L'auteur, ancien chef du projet, décrit les difficultés de sa mise en œuvre, car la communauté d'Oradour, détentrice de la mémoire des victimes, s'opposa souvent aux initiatives publiques et, plus largement, à toute vision critique de l'événement dont une meilleure connaissance aurait pu, pourtant, hâter le travail du deuil. /// In 1993, the general council of the Haute-Vienne decided to build a welcome and information cultural center for the visitors to the ruins of Oradour-sur-Glane, martyr zed by the SS division "Das Reich" in June 1944. This "Memory Center" was inaugurated in 1999 by the President of the Republic. The author, the former head of the project, describes the difficulties of its implementation, because the community of Oradour, the holder of the victims' memory, often took issue with the public initiatives and any critical vision of the event even though more knowledge of it could have hastened the period of mourning.<br>

Publisher: Scholars Press<br>
Issue: i40000773<br>
Date: 4 1, 1988<br>
Author(s): Gunnemann Jon P.<br>
Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Abstract: This review essay explores Josiah Young's project of developing a liberatory Pan-Africanism that is attuned to cultural diversity and Victor Anderson's advocacy of postmodern cultural criticism in African-American religious thought. After situating African-American religious thought as a branch of Africana thought, the author examines these two religious thinkers' work as an effort to forge a position on African-American religious thought--including its relation to theology--in an age where even theory is treated as a god that is about to die. At the conclusion, secularism emerges as a religious project that normatively undergirds the methodological dimensions of these works..<br>

Abstract: El presente estudio revisa los presupuestos teóricos de los estudios culturales y el área de la cultura popular en Gran Bretaña a partir de 1950. Esta esfera de lo popular fue definida por la sociedad de masas mediado el siglo xx, y por quienes como Theodor W. Adorno y Max Horkheimer teorizaron sobre la cultura que le es propia. Los artistas modernos y sus críticos abrieron entonces una brecha insalvable entre el arte y los objetos comerciales de dicha cultura. El primero se reservó la esfera del saber y del arte, mientras que los segundos pasaban a engrosar la esfera del mercado social. La noción moderna de cultura de masas estableció el precedente de las consideraciones del británico Raymond Williams y de los estudios culturales posteriores a él. La corriente británica trató de superar esta comprensión moderna de la cultura. /// This study is a conceptual revisión of the background of cultural studies and the popular culture field in Great Britain in the 1950s. This academic domain was defined by mass society in the middle of the 20th century, and by those who, like Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer, spoke about mass culture. Modern artists and their critics then created an insuperable divide between art and the commercial objects of popular culture. The former claimed the sphere of art and knowledge, whereas popular culture belonged to the social market. Based on this división, the modern notion of mass culture set the precedent of Raymond Williams' popular culture concept, and the theoretical formulation of other authors who developed the British cultural perspective. It was a project which tried to overeóme this modern vision of culture.<br>

Abstract: The objective of this article is to articulate the hermeneutics of liberation in Ayi Kwei Annan's Two Thousand Seasons. Premised on an assertion that Two Thousand Seasons is divisible into three sections—the realm of the godhead, the realm of the ancestors, and the realm of the living—this article will argue that the protagonists of the novel use land, an abode of the ancestors, as a text through which they form themselves into a healing community. Reinterpreting African belief systems' claim of connectedness of the ancestors to the gods and the godhead, this article will assert that when the protagonists have authentic relationship with each other and their world, they constitute gods or creative forces and consequently have a glimpse of the godhead. Commencing by articulating African belief systems' concepts of godhead, gods, and ancestors, this article concludes by describing the hermeneutic project of the novel's protagonists.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar sentido à afirmação feita, mais do que uma vez, por Paul Ricoeur, de que a sua filosofia poderia ser vista como um kantismo pós-hege-liano. Nesse contexto, o artigo procura abordar o pensar ricoeuriano mostrando de que modo ele se instaura e se desenvolve no horizonte kantiano de uma filosofia dos limites do saber. Essa abordagem é desenvolvida em dois momentos. O primeiro dirige-se à leitura que Paul Ricoeur faz da Crítica da Razão Pura de Kant. O segundo centrar-se-à em três momentos fulcrais da Filosofia de Paul Ricoeur - a definição do seu projecto Filosofia da Vontade, a figura própria da sua Hermenêutica e o filosofema inovação semântica - evidenciando em cada um deles a ressonância da herança kantiana. /// Aim of this article is to to explore the meaning of Paul Ricoeur's persistent characterization of his own work as a post-Hegelian Kantism. In view of this end, the article demonstrates that Ricoeur's thinking is at once rooted and developed within the horizon of Kant's critical philosophy of limits in regard to knowledge. This can be shown by first considering Ricoeur's reading of the first Critique, and then centering on three decisive moments of Ricoeur's philosophy, to wit, the formulation of the project developed in the Philosophy of Will, the shape of his theory of hermeneutics, and his notion of semantic innovation that can be conceived as a philosophema. The Kantian influence can be seen to resonate in all three instances.<br>

Abstract: A obra de Ricoeur constitui certamente uma contribuição importantc para o pensamento contemporâneo. Todavia, possui postulados metafísicos que limitam o alcance do seu projecto filosófico e religioso. A repetição de uma tese fundamental de Ricoeur tem a pretensão de desbloquear e de superar este limite. /// S'il est hors de doute que l'oeuvre de Ricoeur constitue une contribution importante pour la pensée contemporaine, néanmoins la présence en elle de postulats métaphysiques a pour effet de limiter la portée de son projet philosophique et religieux. La reprise d'une thése fondamentale et particuliérement révélatrice de Ricoeur a pour but de débloquer cette situation et de ces limites. /// No one can doubt Ricoeur's contribution to contemporary thought. However, the presence of metaphysical postulates in his work limit the potential originality of his philosophical and religious project. Through the repetition of an especially fundamental thesis, the author of this article attempts to overcome this limit.<br>

Issue: i40014477<br>
Date: 6 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): da Veiga Manuel Alte<br>
Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Article Title: Gadamerian Ethics and the Task of Theology<br>
Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014488<br>
Date: 12 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Carr Thomas K.<br>
Abstract: In recent years, frequent reference has been made to philosophical hermeneutics by scholars working in theology. This is not surprising, for not only is Gadamer conversant with many historical and contemporary sources of Christian theology, and defends key theological concepts as integral to philosophical hermeneutics, there is also much in philosophical hermeneutics, especially when read as an ethics, that lends itself to the concerns of theologians. This essay argues first that Gadamer's project ought to be read as such, and then illustrates ways in which an iteration of Gadamerian hermeneutics as an ethics might be received by theologians, especially those wanting to trace the development of human self-understanding in its relations to religious traditions. /// No âmbito da teologia contemporânea fazem-se referências frequentes à hermenêutica filosófica. Isto não nos deve surpreender, já que, por um lado, Gadamer está amplamente familiarizado com muitas das fontes, tanto históricas como actuals, da teologia cristã, defendendo mesmo a proximidade de algumas noções centrais da teologia com a hermenêutica filosófica; por outro lado, no entanto, verifica-se que muito daquilo que faz parte da hermenêutica filosófica, sobretudo na medida em que a lermos como uma ética, se adapta perfeitamente a várias das preocupações metis distintas recentemente manifestadas por parte de alguns teólogos. O artigo começa por defender este modo de ler o projecto de Gadamer, procurando em seguida ilustrar modos segundo os quais uma iteraço da hermenêutica gadameriana enquanto etica deve ser acolhida por parte de todos quantos em teologia desejem relacionar o processo de desenvolvimento da autocompreensao humana com as grandes tradições religiosas.<br>

Date: 3 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Hart Curtis W.<br>
Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Date: 9 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Maldamé Jean-Michel<br>
Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Abstract: El propósito de esta artículo es reconstruir itinerario de investigción, a través de los diferentes proyectos que lo componen y que fueron realizados en los diez últimos años, con el fin de develar cierta coherencia metodológica y teórica. Cada estudio de esta trayectoria se propone analizar varias facetas de la juventud, desde un punto de vista antropológico y sociológico. Los años de doctorado fueron dedicados a entender el proceso de construcción identitaria de los jóvenes pijos madrileños a través de sus usos y costumbres. Luego, un trabajo post-doctoral se orientó hacia la ano-rexia nerviosa y la feminidad en jóvenes de la ciudad de México. Tercero, un trabajo de campo en la Meseta Tarasca permitió el acercamiento y entendimiento de las "nuevas" representaciones y prácticas de algunos jóvenes acerca de su cuerpo y de su alimentación, así como de algunas lógicas familiares, desestructuradas y re-estructuradas por el hecho de la migración hacia Estados Unidos. Por último, se presenta un cuarto proyecto sobre "bulimia, sexualidades y género", inscrito en una propuesta global de estudio de las inversiones de la "valencia diferencial de los sexos". /// The author revisits her research itinerary, reviewing the different projects that compose work carried out in the last ten years. The aim is to reveal a certain methodological and theoretical coherence. Each study in this trajectory set out to analyze several aspects of young people's lives from an anthropological and sociological point of view. The PhD years were invested in researching the process of identity construction of the Madrilenian pijos (young people from middle an upper middle class) through their uses and customs. Postdoctoral work was focused on nervous anorexia and femininity in young women in Mexico City. Later on, fieldwork in the Tarascan Plateau in Michoacán state in Mexico enabled the author to approach and understand the "new" representations and practices of some young people concerning their bo~<br>

Author(s): Gildea Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is the text of an inaugural lecture given as Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford on 7 November 2008. It arises from a research project entitled Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories', which involves a team of historians examining samples of activist networks in fourteen European countries, in order to understand ways of becoming an activist, being an activist and making sense of activism. The key terms of this project are transnationalism – tracing resonances and interactions between activists and activist networks across frontiers – and subjectivity – using oral testimony to understand the phenomenon of activism. The framing and presentation of the project incited a rethink of the methods of oral history, not least because the project originated in Oxford, where scepticism persists about the credibility of oral history as a discipline. To persuade this audience of the power of oral history, the approach was taken to locate it at the confluence of three recent developments which have impacted on the study of history as a whole: the linguistic turn, memory studies, and interest in subjectivity, intersubjectivity and the unconscious. These reflections are then used to illuminate evidence drawn from French activists interviewed in the course of 2007 and 2008.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo estudia los filmes realizados por soldados franceses durante la Guerra de Argelia (1954-1962), considerándolos historias de vida que permiten comprender el entorno psicológico que habitaban estas tropas. Investigando el valor testimonial de estos filmes que muestran fragmentos de la vida cotidiana, se analiza la articulación de las vidas de esos soldados y el conjunto de los fenómenos colectivos que los rodean. ¿De qué modo irrumpen estas historias en la Historia oficial? Esta historia de los combatientes, rara vez analizada por la historiografía, completa la historia oficial de los documentales realizados por el Servicio Cinematográfico de los Ejércitos. This project studies films made by French soldiers during the Algerian War (1954-1962). I view them as "life stories" that offer insight into the psychological environment these troops inhabited. I investigate the testimonial value of these films that show us fragments of daily life, and I examine the articulation between the lives of these individuals and the whole ensemble of collective phenomena surrounding them. How do their histories break into official History? This history of the combatants, so very rarely drawn upon by historiographers, completes the official history of the documentaries made by the Army Cinematographic Service.<br>

Abstract: Segment contestataire de la biomédecine moderne, le mouvement des soins palliatifs constitue actuellement un « paradigme global » de prise en charge du mourir, de la mort et du deuil, proposant simultanément une approche holistique du malade, un modèle d'organisation des soins, une éthique alternative et un projet politique dont l'ensemble fusionne en une synthèse inédite. Aussi, l'impact grandissant des soins palliatifs en France mérite que l'on retrace l'historique de leur institutionnalisation et que l'on mette au jour les fondements idéologiques (clinique, humaniste, herméneutique et chrétien) de leur doctrine. Ainsi définis, les soins palliatifs incarnent-ils à nos yeux un mouvement paradoxal de médicalisation du mourir contemporain. Contestant segment of the modem biomedical world, the palliative care movement represents a « Paradigm » of care of the dying, death and mourning, proposing simultaneously holistic approach of patient, work organisation, alternative ethics and political project which blend into an original synthesis. Thus, the growing impact of palliative care in France leads us to retrace the history of their institutionalisation and to analyse the ideological basements (clinical, humanistic, hermeneutic and Christian) of their doctrine. So defined, the palliative care movement embodies a paradoxical movement of medicalization of contemporary dying.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: Husserlian phenomenology sets off as a fundamental rejection of those psychologisms and anthropologisms that deduce the structures of appearance from some preexisting essence of man. However, despite a clear rejection of all anthropological foundations of phenomenology, the examples of Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty show that the question of man continues to haunt the phenomenological project and constitutes something likea 'blind spot'. Relating these unspoken tensions to another historical 'scene' (the debate between the Sophists and Aristotle), the article argues why phenomenology is to be seen as the endeavor of replying to the initial Protagorean provocation to thinking.<br>

Article Title: Stanley Cavell on Modern Music: "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It" after Forty Years<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i40044259<br>
Date: 4 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Cox Franklin<br>
Abstract: Cavell's influential mid-1960s critique of the "new music" of the postwar era poses significant challenges for contemporary composers who value this music. As with postmodernist critics, he has ably identified shortcomings in justifications for recent modernist music. With the benefit of time, however, the distance between Cavell's and the postmodernists' views concerning subjectivity and the role of the arts in defining it have become increasingly clear. In Cavell's scenario, a contemporary listener or critic confronted with the new music faces a sort of existentialist crisis: he or she is unable to individually affirm the value of a music that conforms to no recognizable models for music yet accepts the fact that this music is, according to Cavell's model of modernism, the fruit of an inexorable historical development. Cavell's interest in this dilemma stems. from the wider aims of his philosophical project, particularly his focus on the perils of the nihilism he finds evident in deterministic and mechanistic theories of the arts. In this light, in both "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It," Cavell appears to be using new music primarily as a vehicle to articulate his concerns and to criticize formalist theories of artistic interpretation, such as that of Wimsatt and Beardsley. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of an effort on Cavell's part to engage this music with the same seriousness that is evident in his writings on modernist authors and visual artists. Toward the end of the article, attention is drawn to the ethical responsibility, given the situation Cavell has sketched, for a critic of the modern arts to make a commitment, either to an existing modern music or to a possible future music.<br>

Article Title: Le Quilt : un mémorial vivant pour les morts du sida<br>
Publisher: Armand Colin<br>
Issue: i40044534<br>
Date: 3 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Fellous Michèle<br>
Abstract: Le Quilt possède une double dimension, singulière et militante : chaque panneau, chaque nom énoncé lors du déploiement signifie l'unicité de chaque disparu ; mais l'assemblage des patchworks, leur abandon à l'association qui va les recueillir, les assembler et les utiliser pour porter à l'attention du monde entier l'énormité de la catastrophe renvoie à la dimension sociale inhérente au décès de chaque individu mort du sida. Le développement fulgurant du rite du patchwork aux États-Unis s'explique par ce double enjeu et par la réappropriation de symboles fondateurs de l'imaginaire américain. En se réappropriant un symbole commun, le Quilt légitime et réintègre la communauté gay porteuse du projet dans cette société qui l'a niée. The Quilt has from the outset both a singular and militant dimension : each panel, each name mentioned during the unfolding means the uniqueness of each dead ; but the assembled patchworks, their donation to the association which will conserve, assemble and use them to draw worldwide attention to this dreadful disaster refer to the social dimension inherent to each individual having died of AIDS. The extremely rapid development of the patchwork rite in the United States can be explained by these two functions and within the reappropriation of founding symbols of the Americans'world of imagination. By reappropriating a common symbol the Quilt legitimates and reintegrates the gay community, bearer of the project, into a society from which it was rejected. Von Anfang an hat der Quilt eine eigenartige und zugleich militante Dimension. Jeder Teil des Patchworks, jeder Name, der während der Entfaltung ausgesprochen wird, besagt die Eigenartigkeit jedes Gestorbenen. Doch verweisen das Zusammenfügen der Patchworkwerke und ihre Überlassung dem Verein, der sie bewahren, zusammenfügen und verwenden wird, um die Aufmerksamkeit der ganzen Welt auf diese schreckliche Katastrophe zu lenken, auf die dem Tode jedes AIDSkranken inhärente soziale Dimension.

Abstract: De 1997 à 2002, eurent lieu la naissance, l'élaboration puis la création par l'Ensemble Modem de Francfort d'un opéra vidéo du compositeur minimaliste américain Steve Reich et de la vidéaste Beryl Korot: Three Tales. Cet opéra était une commande de Klaus Peter Kehr, directeur musical des Wiener Festwochen (Vienne). Sa réalisation mobilisa un important réseau de collaborations aboutissant à un montage financier mené sur la base d'une coproduction de grande ampleur réunissant des festivals européens de création contemporaine de premier rang et deux festivals américains. L'auteur décrit sa démarche, à travers quelques « moteurs de recherche », ainsi que son implication personnelle dans le projet lui-même. The birth, preparation, and actual performance of Three Tales, a video opera signed by Steve Reich, the American minimalist composer, and Beryl Korot, the video-artist, took place between 1997 and 2002, under the aegis of the Frankfurt Modern Ensemble. The opera had been commissioned by Klaus Peter Kehr, musical director of the Wiener Festwochen in Vienna. The project was thus based on a vast collaborative network resulting in an coproduction agreement for funding. This agreement brought together a number of leading European festivals for contemporary creation and two American festivals. The author of the paper describes his research protocol, by way of a certain number of "search engines". He also refers to his own personal involved in the project. Zwischen 1997 und 2002 wurde die Idee zu der Videooper „Three Tales" des minimalistischen Komponisten Steve Reich und des Videokünstlers Beryl Korot vom Modernen Ensemble der Oper Frankfurt umgesetzt. Die Oper war eine Auftragsarbeit des Intendanten der Wiener Festwochen, Klaus Peter Kehr. Ihre Inszenierung konnte finanziell durch ein Netzwerk realisiert werden, einer Kooperation von hochrangigen europäischen und amerikanischen Festivals zeitgenössischer Kunst.

Abstract: Pour perpétuer des éléments fondateurs de la culture, les communautés des diasporas utilisent leur espace privé comme territoire privilégié de la conservation et de l'expression d'une identité exilée. L'exemple des Arméniens du Québec est, à cet égard, particuliérement révélateur tant dans la composition de sa culture matérielle et immatérielle que dans les pratiques qui la mettent en scène par l'entremise de petits musées domestiques. À partir d'un recueil de récits de vie et de biographies d'objets, l'article propose d'établir le portrait de ces structures muséales et de leurs collections à l'échelle familiale pour ensuite saisir leur oeuvre dans le projet de transmission culturelle. Living in a Diaspora commands an increased vigilance for the perpetuation of the founding elements of a culture. In this perspective, in a host country, the private sphere and its heritage constitute a privileged space for the preservation and expression of the exiled identity. This can be seen in domestic museums, such as those of Quebec's Armenian community, where the composition of material and immaterial culture and the presentation of its contents are particularly revealing. From a collection of life narratives and object biographies, this article proposes to draw a portrait of these family-scale museum structures and their collections to understand how they function in the project of cultural transmission. Um elementare Bestandteile ihrer Kultur zu erhalten, nutzen kulturelle Gemeinschaften in der Diaspora gerne den privaten Raum als Statte des Ausdrucks ihrer Exilidentität. Die Gemeinschaft der in Quebec lebenden Armenier ist hierfür ein sehr gutes Beispiel, sowohl was ihre materielle und immaterielle Kultur angeht als auch im Hinblick auf die Art und Weise wie sie ihre Kultur in kleinen hauslichen Museen inszenieren. An Hand von menschlichen wie auch gegenständlichen Biographien porträtiert die Autorin in diesem Artikel die musealen Strukturen und Familiensammlungen, um das en~<br>

Abstract: A educaçao é vulgarmente considerada um importante instrumento impulsionador da transformacäo social. Alias, segundo a teoría liberal, a educaçao foi sempre considerada urna via para a mobilidade social e a chave do progresso individual e social. Todavía, foi nos anos 60 que a educaçao começou a atrair as atençôes dos economistas, dos políticos, dos organismos internacionais e dos movimentos revolucionarios. Com efeito, tiveram lugar certos acontecimentos que levaram a olhar mais de perto os processus e as instituiçôes educacionais. A elaboraçâo de teorías económicas da educaçao constituí um indicativo deste descente interesse pela educaçao e pelo saber. A concepçâo económica do « capital humano » contém, porém, pressupostos ideológicos que reforçam o modelo capitalista da sociedade. De qualquer modo, a educaçao, em termos de descimentó económico e mobilidade social, foi posta em evidencia em todos os países capitalistas desenvolvidos. Nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, a crescente industrializaçâo também salientou o papel da educaçao na mudança social. Mas, além dos problemas do desenvolvimento capitalista nos países desenvolvidos e da industrializaçâo nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, os anos 60 e os principios dos anos 70 proporcionaran! outras razöes para destacar a importancia da educaçao nas mudanças sociais. Designadamente, as reformas educacionais socialistas em Cuba, na China e, mais recentemente, em diversos países africanos constitiiem inspiraçao para novos e importantes estudos. Na revoluçâo socialista há a consciência de que a luta das classes também se manifesta nas escolas. Por outro lado, as teorías de confuto, marxistas e näo marxistas, também se aplicam à análise das reformas educacionais nas sociedades capitalistas. Estas teorías tentam estabelecer as bases para uma sociedade alternativa, baseada no valor do trabalho. Efectivamente, um projecto de mudanças educacionais como parte integrante de um processo de revoluçâo cultural deriv~<br>

Abstract: O artigo pretende apresentar um novo modelo de distribuição das ajudas sociais na França, modelo esse entretanto conhecido pelo nome de "alocação personalizada". Trata-se de um mecanismo que, em seu mesmo funcionamento e nas suas justificações éticas, se opõe seja ao sistema actual dominante, herdeiro do Estado-Provi-dência, seja ao projecto alternativo de alocação universal, ou basic income, entretanto amplamente debatido. Objectivo principal do artigo, porém, é explorar os fundamentos filosóficos subjacentes à proposta em causa. Tal como o próprio nome indica, o princípio da "alocação personalizada" apoia-se sobre o contributo de uma filosofia social específica, o personalismo. Assim, evocando principalmente os escritos de Emmanuel Mounier e de Max Scheler, os autores pretendem mostrar até que ponto esta filosofia social suporta uma concepção original da solidariedade, ela própria fundada sobre uma relação específica aos outros. Neste sentido, a proposta que aqui se faz em favor de uma "alocação personalizada" pode ser lida e interpretada como uma aplicação directa da perspectiva personalista a um problema preciso de economia política, a saber, o da organização da assistência social. This paper intends to present a new model for distribution of social assistance in France, a model which has been known by the name of "personalized allocation". It is a mechanism which opposes itself, in its own functioning and in its ethical justifications, both to the present dominant system, heir to the Welfare State, and to the alternative project of universal allocation, or basic income, which in the mean-while has been largely debated. The main aim of this paper, then, is to explore the philosophical fundaments underlying the proposal of the model in question. Like the very name indicates, the principle of "personalized allocation" is based on the contribution of a specific social philosophy, namely personalism. Thus, chiefly calling forth the writings of Emmanuel Mounier and M~<br>

Abstract: The formative Assessment for Learning proposals outlined by Black and Wiliam (e.g. Black et al., 2002) have been well publicised. Since 2002, in its Assessment is for Learning programme, the Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED) has been exploring ways of bringing research, policy and practice in assessment into closer alignment using research on both assessment and transformational change. This paper focuses on one project within Assessment Is for Learning, in which pilot primary and secondary schools across Scotland were encouraged to develop formative assessment approaches in classrooms. They were supported in this by researchers, curriculum developers and local and national policy-makers. The paper examines the rationale and methods behind the enactment of formative assessment in these schools. It draws upon evidence provided by the interim and final reports of participating schools to draw conclusions about areas of success within the project and potential barriers to the project's future in its evolution from pilot to national programme.<br>

Abstract: This review essay attempts to provide a broad sampling of Conrad studies that is representative of major currents in the field. The essay is structured around three basic areas of Conrad studies—biography, textual scholarship, and criticism. The first of these is given the greatest prominence because of the recent publication of two major biographies with sharply contrasting approaches to Conrad's Polish background and its importance in the appreciation of his works. The section devoted to textual scholarship comments on the ambitious project launched by Cambridge University Press to make available Conrad's works and letters in an authoritative form for the first time. The essay concludes with a brief overview of recent critical currents in Conrad scholarship, in the light of the ongoing debate over the usefulness of "extrinsic" as opposed to "intrinsic" approaches.<br>

Abstract: This article addresses the woman teller's identity in the literary fairy tales of France. The author rereads prefaces and images that scholars have used to demonstrate the woman teller's literarity to argue rather for her "frivolity," a word the women themselves use to describe their writing. The essay finds that frivolity is an aesthetic principle at the heart of the women's poetic project that marks their difference from even the Modern partisans of the great literary debate. The principle of frivolity is captured in an image that recurs in prefaces by the writers: the "modern" fairy.<br>

Abstract: Clifford Geertz's influential definition of religions as providing their members with both an ethos and a worldview-in his terms, both a "model for" and "model of" reality-has of late become a neuralgic point of contention in religious studies. In particular some critics have seen his ideas of religious models of reality as biased, out-moded, or in other ways confused about the way that language refers (or does not refer) to the world. In this article, I consider two criticisms of Geertz's project and seek to show that, despite the partial value of the criticisms, the idea of religious models of reality continues to be a legitimate and fruitful approach to what religious communities are typically up to.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Abstract: Any praxis is inscribed in time. To what extent does man's perception of time leave an inprint on Saussurian 'langue' ? Revisiting a well-beaten track in linguistic studies, we propose to give this farreaching question a partial answer concerning the opposition between French imparfait and passé simple. We first capture the opposition between those two tenses in a passive way, in which man as a subject (subjected to...) bears witness to the flow of time from future to past; we then capture the opposition in an active way, in which man as a project bears witness to the flow of time from past to future. This two-fold representation bears on the opposition between imperfect and simple past. It is shown next that linguistic theories view tenses as markers of localisation in time whereas verb forms also help mark how the time implied by the process is viewed, what orientation is given to it. Our contention is that implied time is represented in a downward fashion (particularisation) with imperfect and in an upward fashion (generalisation) with simple past.<br>

Abstract: Fazendo emergir elementos susceptíveis de desconstruir o filme Vertigo de Alfred Hitchcock e, assim, operar uma hermenêutica do testemunho, procuraremos demonstrar como a metafísica do "tempo do projecto" e a atitude filosófica do "catastrofismo esclarecido" propostas por Jean-Pierre Dupuy, integram-se e sustentam-se na lógica do testemunho. Este trabalho apresenta-se como um triplo pretexto: num primeiro momento, a insustentabilidade do niilismo uma vez que, se o desejo mimético pode ser "niilizante", ele também é condição da possibilidade do luto e, portanto, de (re-)criação e do testemunho; num segundo momento, o de mostrar a compatibilidade da desconstrução de Jacques Derrida com a hermenêutica do testemunho esboçada por Paul Ricœur, podendo ser a primeira o momento da conversão impulsionador da (re-)criação do sentido, necessário à concretização da segunda; num terceiro momento, o de considerarmos a hipótese do tempo do projecto e do testemunho, enquanto excedente do tempo da catástrofe e do niilismo, serem uma brecha para entrevermos o recuo, o adiar, a economia do desvio diferencial da crueldade humana e da violência. Making emerge elements that can help us deconstruct the film Vertigo of Alfred Hitchcock and, therefore, operate a hermeneutic of testimony, we will try to demonstrate how the metaphysics of the "Time of Project" and the philosophical attitude of the "enlightened catastrophism" proposed by Jean-Pierre Dupuy can be integrated and sustained in the logic of testimony. This work presents itself as a triple pretext: in a first moment, the unsustainability of the nihilism, once that, if the mimetic desire may be "nihilist", it is also a condition for the possibility of mourning and, therefore, for the possibility of (re-)creation and testimony; in a second moment, to show the compatibility of deconstruction of Jacques Derrida with the hermeneutics of testimony outlined by Paul Ricœur, being the first probably the moment of the catalyst conversion of (~<br>

Abstract: O propósito do artigo é determinar a situação do pensamento de Dilthey no contexto da hermenêutica. Objetiva primordialmente, assim, determinar se a hermenêutica diltheyana seria filosófica ou se ainda se enquadraria na qualificação de clássica (=tradicional). Secundariamente, o trabalho ainda intenta caracterizar de modo breve a situação histórica na qual o pensamento de Dilthey se ambienta, e apresentar, por meio do projeto de fundamentação das ciências humanas, os pressupostos diltheyanos e alguns conceitos fundamentais de seu pensamento. As hipóteses a serem validadas são as seguintes: a) existe no pensamento diltheyano uma intuição filosófica; b) tal intuição filosófica se evidencia no propósito crítico, na preocupação ontognoseológica e na visada psicológica que a obra tardia do filósofo possuirá; c) em seu modo de operação, a hermenêutica de Dilthey ainda é metódica e, portanto, clássica (não-filosófica). The aim of the essay is to determine the status of Dilthey's thought in the context of hermeneutics. It aims to to determine, first, whether the hermeneutics by Dilthey would be philosophical or if it would still be classical (=traditional). The work also seeks to characterize the historical situation in which Dilthey's thoughts settles, and to present, through the project of foundation of human sciences, his assumptions and some fundamental concepts of his thought. The hypotheses to be validated are the following: a) there is a philosophical intuition in Dilthey's thought; b) the content of the philosophical thought of Dilthey shows itself in his critical purpose, in his ontognoseological concern and in the psychological perspective in the late work of the philosopher, c) in their mode of operation, the hermeneutics of Dilthey is still methodic and therefore classical (non-philosophical).<br>

Abstract: This study represents a Chapter from a section devoted to the composition of a literary work and is part of a larger project called ‘The Poetics of a Work of Literature in the Twentieth Century’, which is being undertaken by the Theory Department of the Institute of Czech Literature. The fragment and fragmentariness in a twentieth-century literary work are a manifestation of a marked tendency towards discontinuity or in some cases towards continuity of a certain kind. There exist works of art that for various reasons remain fragments without, however, being preceived as such (the novels of Kafka and Ladislav Klíma’s Velký román, are cases in point); on the other hand, the fragment, that is to say an intentional fragment (such as a sketch or a synopsis), becomes an independent genre whose roots go back to Romanticism (for instance Novalis’s fragment). The fragment and fragmentarieness that manifests itself in the text in the widest possible number of ways (intentional incompleteness and sporadicity, ‘blank spots’ in the Story, the mixing of heterogeneous elements, the alternating of various genres within one work, and so on), we understand as a reaction to the idea about the work as a complete, inlernally unified and accomplished whole with a clear and single Sense, an idea that Classicism molleyeoddled, which was then to a large exient done by Realism and with it all so-called decadent literature (including tendencious, Socialist-Realist literature). The fragment and fragmentariness (with which is linked the idea of a sense that continuously defies being pinned down to any one definition, which follows from its quality of not being fully told, from suggestion, hints, silence, gaps and ‘ holes’) are, in the literature of the twentieth century, perceived as both a genre and also as approaches that can express the open nature of being and of the world better than the whole work can. Because fragmentary works often represent a work in a nascent state or in a state of tr~<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: This study is concerned with the method and results of an empirical research project called’ Regional Topics and the Understanding of Region: Research into Reception of Literature in Silesia and North Moravia’, which took place in May 1998. The starting point was an attempt to summarize the predominant approaches to regionalism, the particular nature of a region, and the predominant forms of Communication in regional Communication in the arts and in society in general. The chosen method of asking the questions and the results of the quantitative analysis have been received with a certain degree of scepticism, though a comparison with some of the signs and features discovered in similar research in 1982-4 is not without interest. The entire matter, however, has taken on a new form and cannot be looked at in isolation.<br>

Author(s): THOUARD Denis<br>
Abstract: Si l'on admet que l'herméneutique part de la reconnaissance d'une intention de signifier donnée déposée dans des signes, force est de considérer que l'entreprise kantienne s'y oppose, aussi bien d'un point de vue systématique que d'un point de vue historique. On critiquera à cette occasion la tentative de tirer du kantisme, en particulier de la troisième Critique, un point de départ pour une herméneutique. L'étude de « l'herméneutique morale » de l'écrit sur la religion replacé dans le contexte de la critique biblique de son époque apporte une confirmation des analyses systématiques et souligne les limites du dispositif kantien. Les reproches adressés par les tenants de « l'école mythique » de Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) à la Religion dans les limites de la simple raison reviennent à distinguer nettement jugement et interprétation : Kant met en oeuvre un jugement, et non une interprétation. If one admits that the starting point of hermeneutics is a recognition of an intention to signify facts left in signs, then one must recognize that the project of Kant is opposed to this starting point, both from a systematic and historical point of view. The temptation to take from the works of Kant, especially the Third Critique, a starting point for hermeneutics will be subject to analysis. A study of « moral hermeneutics » that is drawn from the texts of religion (and which is done within the context of the biblical criticism of their period) confirms the analysis et underlines the limits of the Kantian plan of action. The criticisms of the « l'école mythique » of Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) aimed at Religion within the limits of simple reason aid to clearly distinguish between judgement and interpretation. Kant implements a judgment and not an interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Le projet métaphorologique de Hans Blumenberg correspond - répond et s'oppose, comme « la Mythologie blanche » de Jacques Derrida - à l'idée heideggérienne de « de l'être ». Le concept de « l'inconceptuabilitè » révise cette critique historiquement limitée du logocentrisme, en réduisant le concept d'Etre de Heidegger ad absurdum. Hans Blumenberg's project of a metaphorology corresponds — answers and contrediets, as Jacques Derrida's « Mythologie blanche » does - to the heideggerian idea of « history of being ». The device of « unconceptuability » reformulates this critics of logocentrism, historically limited, by reducing ad absurdum Heidegger's concept of being.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport de l'œuvre de Paul Ricœur à la modernité ne va pas de soi. Imprégnée profondément par le testament judéo-chrétien, méfiante à l'égard des ruptures brutales, soucieuse d'incarner le cogito dans l'existence, sa philosophie pourrait aisément s'inscrire dans une tendance néo-traditionaliste. Cette dimension anti-moderne se renforce en raison de la place majeure que la pensée de Ricœur accorde aux mouvances post-modernes, qu'elles soient d'inspiration vitaliste, structuraliste ou post-structuraliste. Pourtant, jamais le philosophe n'a abandonné ni le projet émancipateur, ni la conquête reflexive du cogito portés par la modernité. La dialectique subtile et originale dans son œuvre de ces trois paradigmes philosophiques se traduit donc sous la forme d'un modernisme paradoxal qui se comprend mieux lorsqu'on le replace dans le cadre d'un réformisme moral et politique, à l'opposé aussi bien d'un éloge de la tradition que des emportements révolutionnaires. The links Paul Ricœur's works maintain with modernity cannot be taken for granted. Being deeply immersed in the Judeo-Christian Legacy, wary of abrupt brenks, concerned about embodying the Cogito in existence, his philosophy could be easily associated with a neo-traditionalist trend. This anti-modern dimension is strengthened because of the chief place that Ricœur attaches in his philosophy to the post-modern ways of thinking, whatever inspiration they come from: vitalist, structuralist or post-structuralist. However, the philosopher abandoned neither the emancipatory project, nor the reflexive practice of the Cogito carried by modernity. Therefore, in his works, the subtle and original dialectics of these three philosophical paradigms expresses itself in the way of a paradoxical modernism which can be better understood when it is considered within a political and ethical reformism. Such a point of view is opposed to a praise of tradition as well as to revolutionary outbursts.<br>

Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Abstract: On a souvent voulu voir dans l'herméneutique pré-heideggérienne une méthodologie des sciences humaines. Si l'idée remonte bien à la fin du xixe siècle, cette méthodologie herméneutique des sciences humaines n'a vraiment été élaborée de façon systématique qu'après Heidegger et en réaction à sa conception ontologique de l'interprétation, par le juriste italien Emilio Beiti (1890-1968). Sa pensée étant peu connue en France on présentera, à l'occasion de son centenaire, les idées directrices, mais aussi les limites, de sa théorie herméneutique. La symétrie des herméneutiques de Betti et de Gadamer sera soulignée : tandis que le juriste Betti trouve son paradigme de la compréhension dans l'activité contemplative du philologue, Gadamer, dont la formation est philologique, s'inspire du modèle juridique pour développer son herméneutique universelle de l'application. Preheideggerian hermeneutics has often being seen as an attempt to develop a methodology of the human sciences. If this project goes back to the later xixth century, this hermeneutic methodology of the human sciences was carried through for the first time after Heidegger, and against his ontological conception of interpretation, in the work of the Italian jurist Emilio Betti (1890-1968). This paper will present, on the occasion of his centenary, the main tenets as well as the limits of his hermeneutic theory. The symetry of Betti's and Gadamer's hermeneutics will be stressed : whereas the jurist Betti finds his paradigm of understanding in the contemplative activity of the philologist, Gadamer, whose formation was mainly philological, takes his inspiration from the juridical model in order to put forward his universal hermeneutics of application.<br>

Abstract: L'article s'interroge sur la place réservée à l'individualité, dont le motif est si fortement marqué dans les premiers travaux de Schleiermacher, dans le système abouti et notamment dans l'Éthique. En premier lieu, c'est le rôle de la lecture de Spinoza qui est mis en avant, comme l'inspiration philosophique fondamentale du projet de Schleiermacher, y compris dans son Éthique. Mais l'adoption d'un cadre systématique après 1803, notamment avec la Dialectique après 1811, risque de minorer la place dévolue à l'individualité. C'est dans la conception originale de la temporalité que se trouve la clé de l'articulation entre la logique systématique de la différenciation fonctionnelle et la logique éthique de l'individualisation. This article inquires the significance of the concept of individuality, the purpose of which is particularly stressed in the first writings of Schleiermacher, in the accomplished system and especially in Ethics. At first, it is the interpretation of Spinoza's writings which is put forward as the fundamental philosophical inspiration in Schleiermacher's project, including in Ethics. But the adoption of a systematic framework after 1803, especially in Dialectics after 1811, risks undermining the importance dedicated to individuality. It is in the original conception of time that lays the key connection between the systematic logic of functional differentiation and the ethical logic of individualisation.<br>

Abstract: At Malmö School of Education a project team has tried to find out to what extent people are capable of constructing and presenting historical stories. The practical approach has dominated the project. Participants have been a lot of teacher students and a dozen experienced history teachers at schools in the south of Sweden. The main purpose has been to create teacher-stories for classroom use. To a minor extent we also have examined what narrative competence teenagers can develop. We tried to answer these questions: Is it easy or difficult to create and tell stories that are 1) chronological, 2) true, and 3) meaningful? Our results — more empirically than scientifically based — are: 1) Not only teachers but also pupils can create chronologic presentations. 2) We found some problems when we tried to follow the truth criterion. Story-tellers found it difficult to construct good stories if being limited to use only true elements of the past (found for example in historical dissertations). 3) The biggest problems we met were when we tried to make meaningful stories out of our true stories. Narrative history probably is worth a renaissance. However, much work remains before we know the best ways to develop narrative competence. An der „School of Education“ von Malmö hat ein Forscherteam den Versuch unternommen herauszufinden, bis zu welchem Grad Menschen fähig sind, historische Geschichten zu entwickeln und zu erzählen. Ein praktischer Zugang bestimmte das Projekt. Eine Anzahl Lehramtsstudenten und ein Dutzend erfahrener Geschichtslehrer an Schulen Südschwedens nahmen an diesem Projekt teil. Das Hauptziel war, Geschichten für Lehrer zur Verwendung im Geschichtsunterricht auszuarbeiten. In zweiter Linie ging es darum zu untersuchen, welche narrative Kompetenz Jugendliche entwickeln können. Wir haben versucht, folgende Fragen zu beantworten: Ist es leicht oder schwierig, Geschichten zu schaffen und zu erzählen, die 1. chronologisch, 2. wahr und 3. sinnvoll sind? Unsere Erg~<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the complicated workings of Japan's mnemonic praxis in its establishment of moral authority. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima was a decisive moment inaugurating Japan as the torch-bearer of pacifism. Given Japan's ideational multiplicity as the victim and the victimizer, its pacifist ideology needs further examinations in conceptual and empirical manifestations. This research situates the ambivalent amnesia and political compromises demonstrated during the renovation project of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum from 1985 until 1994. As for a nation yet to achieve meaningful reconciliation over the past with Asian neighbors, the political divide opens room for utilitarian considerations in its pacifist discourse. The Hiroshima experience suggests that Japan's pacifism can be a problematic representation given its selective mnemonic praxis and situational ethics. This paper argues that Japanese pacifism should be redefined as 'pacifist movement.' Pacifism is foundational ethics, whereas pacifist movement accommodates political contextualization.<br>

Abstract: Les "institutions", comme ensemble préexistant et objectivable de ressources de justification, forment le milieu où puisent les agents économiques, pour gérer leurs problèmes de coordination et/ou leurs conflits de reproduction. Les "conventions" sont des représentations collectives de "monde commun justifié", qui activent les institutions, et légitiment les arrangements locaux, au sein des "organisations", dont la production conjointe de marchandises et de règles va reconstituer ou dégrader le milieu institutionnel de départ. Ce modèle conventionnaliste à trois termes cherche à surmonter les difficultés des autres analyses économiques des institutions. Il pose un agent économique rompu aux défauts de coordination et de reproduction, et impensable hors d'un milieu institutionnel composé au minimum du langage, de la monnaie, et du droit. La pluralité des logiques de justification fonde la diversité empirique des institutions. La dynamique des institutions est étudiée à travers les opérateurs qui font et défont les possibilités de "monde commun" à partir de la "pluralité" : la "concurrence" dans l'espace des prix doit être combinée avec la "critique" dans l'espace des valeurs (normes). L'analyse conventionnaliste du capitalisme remet le projet de Marx à l'endroit en déduisant la théorie de l'exploitation d'une théorie de la justice, plutôt que l'inverse. "Institutions", as a set of pre-existing and objective resources of justification, is the milieu where economic agents can find materials to solve their coordination problems and/or their conflicts of reproduction. "Conventions" are collective representations of "justified common worlds" that activate institutions and legitimise arrangements within "organisations", whose joint production of goods and rules will lead to the renewal -or the degeneracy- of prior institutional milieu. This "three terms conventionalist model" endeavors to face the difficulties encountered by the other economic approaches of institutions. I~<br>

Abstract: Les deux courants de pensée politique arabe au Proche-Orient les plus marquants depuis la guerre des Six jours sont, d'une part, les théories palestiniennes de la révolution arabe, et, d'autre part, l'islamisation du socialisme arabe hérité de Nasser. Les textes fondamentaux du FPLP et du FDPLP, mais aussi les études, plus modérées, d'intellectuels proches du Fath et de l'OLP redonnent vie à des sensibilités politiques proche-orientales caractéristiques. En effet, la « révolution palestinienne » est vue expressément à la fois comme locale, provinciale, d'une part, et, d'autre part, comme nationale-arabe, et non comme étatique. Quant au socialisme arabe en quête d'islamisation, il bénéficie de la pensée sociale et politique des Frères musulmans. Socialisme arabe et socialisme islamique se rejoignent, avec en priorité un projet économique d'une urgence évidente. L'intégrisme et le fanatisme politiques des Frères se sont estompés. Cette remontée raisonnable de l'authenticité islamique offre peut-être la chance d'une ferveur mobilisatrice des masses arabes. Ces deux évolutions, chacune à sa façon, contestent la pensée politique héritée de l'Occident. Quelques penseurs arabes ont profité de la catastrophe de juin 1967 pour analyser les structures profondes des sociétés arabes actuelles : communautarisme, mentalité « poétique », et surtout expérience originale de l'appartenance nationale. Réflexions sociologiques assez indépendantes des pressions idéologiques pour aider à saisir un phénomène comme le « nationalisme arabe », par exemple. Since the Six-Day War, the two most prominent lines of Arab political thought in the Near East have been, on the one hand, the Palestinian theories of the Arab revolution and, on the other, the Islamisation of the Arab socialism inherited from Nasser.

Issue: i40127062<br>

Author(s): Bellagamba Alice<br>
Abstract: This article addresses two different experiences of historical recollection. The first is related to a research project on late colonial times, carried out in 2002 with a group of elderly Gambian friends. Their reminiscences allow the depiction of the conflicts and contradictions of this historical period, while showing the interplay between biography and national history, personal and collective memories. The second part of the article describes a more spontaneous activity of history-making, a monthly get-together of an opposition party organised during 2002 and 2003 by the same group of elderly men that joined my research efforts in 2002. The monthly get-together can be seen as a form of political activism played through historical discussions and communication of experiences between elders and youths participating in the meeting. Memory-work thus becomes a strong future-oriented activity aimed at promoting change by means of preserving traces of past experiences and events.<br>

Abstract: The article examines the phenomenon of communist/post-socialist nostalgia, with a focus on Slovenia and Poland, through the central issue of identity, memory and the concrete manifestations of nostalgia. The emergence of a somewhat distinct 'Eastern European' identity and the East--West divide in historical and cultural terms is explored throught several historical events of the European project between the World Wars. The revival of the communist brands, commercial products, symbols, music and film is the core of the communist 'renaissance', witnessing mainly the need for encountering the past, the selevtiveness of memory and the right and emotional need to value one's own personal history and past.<br>

Abstract: The paper describes the settings for an official dialogue between religious communities, including the Catholic Church, and the institutions of the European Union. It goes on to describe some important and necessary contributions that a Christian vision can make to the European project. Finally it considers how far certain styles (rather than content) of Catholic discourse can impede the reception of this vision, and so render effective dialogue more difficult.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Kley Antje<br>
Abstract: This essay is a contribution towards a more systematic consideration of the relation between recognition and autonomy in literary and cultural studies. The readings presented here rest on two premises: First, I assume that literary texts negotiate recognition in ways different from and not completely accessible to philosophy and the social sciences; and second, that the individualistic language of liberalism, which is preoccupied with autonomy and dependence, changes depending on how recognition is negotiated. Both Edward P. Jones's neo-slave narrative The Known World and Richard Powers's novel of ideas The Echo Maker stage historically and socially specific convergences of autonomy and dependence in their depictions of precarious subjectivity. The Known World, situated in the mid-nineteenth-century slave South, shows how the liberal ideal of self-mastery is implicitly linked to the mastery of others as chattel slaves. The Echo Maker, set in the early twenty-first-century Midwest, stages another form of precariousness that in some ways answers the questions of submission and self-mastery raised in the other novel. It suggests an at once more democratic and more literary model of individuality that does not depend on ownership so much as on the logic of storytelling. The novels project distinct diegetic worlds and rely on divergent generic patterns; in exploring the logics of possessive individualism and a more democratic model of storytelling respectively, they offer contingent concepts of agency that are dependent for their private and public stabilizations on very different forms of recognition of the other.<br>

Abstract: The issues raised by different kinds of oral-historical research are explored here through a dialogue between two projects. In one case, the Alderley Sandhills Project, this work has been completed; in the other, the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, the oral-historical research is in its early stages. Through a series of interactions, this article raises a number of different questions that oral-historical research posed at Alderley Sandhills, and it considers the ramifications of and the possible differences in these questions in the case of Ardnamurchan. Adoption of a nonlinear structure echoes one of the many fascinating aspects of oral-historical research itself.<br>

Author(s): Mische Ann<br>
Abstract: While there is an extensive subfield in sociology studying the sources, content, and consequences of collective memory, the study of future projections has been much more fragmentary. In part, this has to do with the challenge of measurement; how do you measure something that has not happened yet? In this article, I argue that future projections can be studied via their externalizations in attitudes, narratives, performance, and material forms. They are particularly evident in what I call "sites of hyperprojectivity," that is, sites of heightened, future-oriented public debate about possible futures. As a pilot project, I examine contending narratives about possible futures in the online documents of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and the accompanying "People's Summit," held in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012. I propose a framework for studying how public interventions into debates about "sustainable futures" and the "green economy" differ on various dimensions of projectivity, including their temporal reach, attention to contingency and causality, and network mapping of future actors. I present a preliminary analysis at the level of narrative and grammar, by analyzing the use of predictive, imperative, and subjunctive verb forms in both programmatic and oppositional texts. I close with a discussion of how different genres of future projection might be put to analytical use in studying processes of interest to social scientists, such as coalition formation, institution building, political mobilization, and policy change.<br>

Abstract: En explorant plus avant le projet des ouvrages théologiques précédents, Au lieu de soi ne distingue pas simplement la pensée de la création de l'onto-théologie mais la sépare aussi de son dépassement heideggérien, qui demeure pour Marion aussi idolâtrique que la métaphysique elle-même. L'ouvrage se concentre ici autour de l'interprétation de l'adonné comme créature par excellence, ou créature iconique — dont le privilège tient à sa temporalité et à sa mutabilité. Indispensable à l'interprétation de saint Augustin comme penseur non métaphysique, l'analyse de la temporalité de l'homme iconique, en démontrant la manière dont la pensée de la création reste hors de l'ontothéologie et de la causa et de l'ego, suggère en même temps que saint Augustin n'affirme le devenir de l'homme qu'en lui enlevant toute innocence et, corrélativement, ne trouve pas de bonheur véritable dans l'amour du mortel comme tel. Extending the project of his prior theological works, Au lieu de soi distinguishes the thought of creation not only from onto-theology but also from its Heideggerian overcoming, which remains for Marion as idolatrous as metaphysics itself Along these lines, the work turns on the interpretation of the adonné as creature par excellence, or as an iconic creature - whose privilege stems from its temporality and mutability. Indispensable to the interpretation of Saint Augustine as non-metaphysical thinker, the analysis of iconic man's temporality, while demonstrating rigorously the way in which the thought of creation remains beyond the onto-theology both of the causa and of the ego, suggests at the same time that Augustine affirms the becoming of man only in depriving it of all innocence and, correlatively, finds no true happiness in love of the mortal as such.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines key implications of praxis theory for applied anthropology. I am concerned with applied anthropology as a communicative and collaborative process and with a critical understanding of the anthropologist's role as consultant, practitioner, and analyst in processes of planned change. The use of praxis as a central analytic leitmotif places "practical" activity, informed by theory, at the center of applied research. The analysis is illustrated through a description of a multi-disciplinary, community-based health research and planning project in seven native communities in Ontario. I examine how practical knowledge and action constrains and transforms academic models of community based development.<br>

Author(s): Johnson Nuala C<br>
Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Author(s): Ghosh Shreya<br>
Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: Le projet de Pierre Thévenaz d'une «philosophie sans absolu» est le fruit de la rencontre entre la raison philosophique et l'expérience-choc de l'annonce chrétienne, qui restitue à l'humain sa dimension uniquement et radicalement humaine. Le monde d'ici-bas devient ainsi le lieu de l'homme dans son histori cité. La méthode de cette conversion à l'en deçà est celle d'une radicalisation de la philosophie reflexive. Si désormais «la raison c'est l'homme», la tâche d'une «philosophie sans absolu» devient l'herméneutique de la condition humaine. P. Thévenaz' project for a "philosophy without an absolute" is the fruit of the meeting of philosophical Reason with the shock-experience of the Christian message which restored to humankind its unique and radically human dimension. The earthly world thus becomes the place of humankind in its historicity. The method of converting to this side is a radicalisation of reflexive philosophy. If henceforth "reason is mankind", then the work of a "philosophy without an absolute" becomes the hermeneutics of the human condition.<br>

Abstract: En réponse aux questions de Philippe Cardon, et indépendamment de remarques de détail, brièvement discutées, l'auteur se réjouit de se voir décerner un certificat de non barthisme. Il s'étonne par contre de la grande naïveté de Philippe Cardon, dont le projet théologique lui semble s'apparenter à un retour massif à Barth, traité de manière littérale et orthodoxe. L'auteur demeure attaché, au contraire, à une reconstruction critique non seulement de la pensée de Barth, mais de l'ensemble de la théologie contemporaine, d'où quelques observations sur les débats actuels au sujet de l'avenir de la théologie académique. Responding to Philippe Cardon, and apart from some detailed remarks briefly discussed, the author is happy to be discerned a certificate of non-Barthianism. However, the great naivety of Philippe Cordon, whose theological project seems like a massive return to Barth, literal and orthodox, surprises him. On the contrary, the author remains attached to a critical reconstruction not only to the thought of Barth, but to the whole of contemporary theology, whence some observations on current debates about the future of academic theology.<br>

En dialogue critique avec cet ouvrage, il tente de formuler une autre manière de concevoir la théologie aujourd'hui. Après avoir explicité les conditions et la base d'accord de ce dialogue, il reprend successivement la question de la définition de la théologie, le problème des rapports entre théologie et sciences des religions et les difficultés liées à la relecture des héritages, pour se terminer par une évaluation globale du projet de Pierre Gisel. As indicated by its sub-title, this article develops an objection to the book of Pierre Gisel, subject of the debate in the present edition. In critical dialogue, it tries to formulate a different way of conceiving theology today. After exposing the conditions and basis for agreement in this debate, it takes up in succession the question of the definition of theology, the problem of the relationships between theology and the science of religions and the difficulties linked to the re-reading of traditions, finishing with a global evaluation of the project of Pierre Gisel.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Abstract: Réponse à l'article publié par G. Lafont: La pertinence théologique de l'histoire, dans la Rev. Sc. ph. th. 63 (1979) 161-202. La discussion doit être épistémologique et théologique. Après avoir rappelé son projet central (penser le monde en faisant droit à la contingence), l'A. propose une réflexion sur le nom. Que le monde soit irrémédiablement pris dans l'historique ne condamne pas à la dissémination: en effet le monde apparaît toujours comme déjà nommé, et le nom est irréductible à l'acte de nomination qui sera toujours réponse (reconnaissance, en acte, d'un nom). Par là, l'A. tente de montrer que son pari théologique ne condamne pas à esquiver le moment nécessaire d'une référence, mais conduit certes à le repenser, à ouvrir une nouvelle ontologie. Pour ce faire, il met à profit certains enseignements de la tradition juive et de l'enseignement psychanalytique. Il signale enfin que loin de rompre avec le passé, son projet ambitionne de renouer en profondeur avec certaines des positions les plus originaires et traditionnelles du christianisme. A response to the article published by G. L. : La pertinence théologique de l'histoire, in Rev. Sc. ph. th. 63 (1979) 161-202. The discussion has to be epistemological and theological. Having recalled his main project (to think the world by giving its place to contingency), the writer is proposing a reflection on the name. That the world cannot but be historical does not condemn it to be disseminated: indeed the world always appears as already named, and the name is irreducible to the nominating act that will always be a response (acknowledgment, in act, of a name). Thus the author tries to demonstrate that his theological bet does not lead to evade the necessary moment of referring, but most certainly to think it over, to work out a new ontology. To bring it about, he makes use of teachings of the Jewish tradition and of the psycho-analytical teaching. Finally he points out that his project not only is far from being a brea~<br>

Publisher: Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company<br>

Author(s): Wittgenstein Michael<br>
Abstract: In this article we develop philosophically Cronbach's (1982) suggestion that the evaluator is an educator. The motivation for this article arose from problems encountered by us on a major evaluation project and from dissatisfaction with the existent philosophical underpinnings of evaluation theory. We propose, and provide a justification for, a model of evaluation based upon the notion of the evaluator as educator, which is sufficiently broad philosophically not only to subsume scientistic and humanistic models, but also to transcend them. Within this broad philosophical model we develop a particular theory of evaluation, based essentially upon Wittgenstein, and in which the notion of a learning community is taken as central. Finally we consider some practical implications of this theory of evaluation.<br>

Article Title: Poetics against Itself: On the Self-Destruction of Modern Scientific Criticism<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219790<br>
Date: 5 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Wolterstorff Roger<br>
Abstract: Modern critical theory is commonly thought of as a collection of diverse methods, schools, systems, and approaches. There is, however, a significant pattern in the diversity. This pattern is generated by the conflict between the widespread effort of twentieth-century theorists to make criticism scientific and the internal resistance to that effort presented by the hermeneutic impulse. The scientific tradition is characterized and unified by a set of common theoretical principles and by a common sequence of transformations that each school within it undergoes. The result of these transformations is that every proposed scientific model for criticism changes into an interpretive method and the project of scientific criticism is subverted.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219810<br>
Date: 10 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Ward Glenn<br>
Abstract: The conceptual dominance of the "heterosexual" in modern thinking has conditioned us, when we consider the Canterbury Tales, to think about the Pardoner and his audience in essentialist terms. The Pardoner and the Host's kiss, however, stills and defers attempts by the masculine gaze of Harry and the "redeemed" pilgrims to control what the Pardoner means. By returning meaning to circulation, the kiss provides an instance in which the Pardoner's body can do more than simply deconstruct categories or gesture elsewhere for meaning. Offering an alternative view of the Pardoner's supposed "destructive otherness," this essay suggests that his true import lies not in his alterity but in his similarity to the other pilgrims and ultimately to us as readers-in short, that the Pardoner constitutes the "open secret" of the Canterbury project.<br>

Author(s): Verhaar Gary<br>
Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Article Title: Introduction: From the "New Ecology" to the New Ecologies<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227583<br>
Date: 3 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wolf Aletta<br>
Abstract: An earlier ecological anthropology defined its project within the compass of the idealism v. materialism debate. Culture was an adaptive tool, instrumental rather than formal; it was intelligible with respect to its material effects, not - as the idealists would maintain - in terms of itself, as an autonomous, self-determining order of reality. This argument was mounted with respect to bounded, stable, self-regulating, local, or at best regional entities and the environment they inhabited. All of the premises of the earlier ecology have since been challenged, and today's ecologies - symbolic, historical, and political - radically depart from the reductions and elisions of the ecological anthropology of the past. In particular, the new ecologies override the dichotomies that informed and enlivened the debates of the past - nature/culture, idealism/materialism - and they are informed by the literature on transnationalist flows and local-global articulations. This introduction positions Rappaport's work within this historical shift from a polarized field of mutually exclusive frameworks to today's synthetic new ecologies and their antireductive materialism. Rappaport's work, produced over three decades, serves, in and through its own transformations, as a bridge between the reductive materialism of the past and a new-materialist ecology.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes “Rotología del poroto” by Pablo de Rokha. Our contention states that the bean works as a multiple and complex metaphor, allowing the poetic voice to refer to the nation, the working-class subjects and the political project of the revolution. Each of these categories takes place in a production context marked by the presence of the hacienda and the Cold War scenario. Additionally, the article analyzes how the poem, at the time of enunciation by the speaker, builds a counterpoint between the Chile of yesterday and today to articulate a social protest speech in favor of the working-class subjects of the national community.<br>

Abstract: Pamela M. Yee is a doctoral candidate and Provost's Fellow in the English department at the University of Rochester. Her research interests include late-medieval romance and dream-visions, confessional narratives, medieval medicine, cognition, psychology, affect theory, trauma studies, and the medical humanities; a secondary strand of her scholarship includes all things Arthurian and a nascent interest in medievalism within pop culture. Her dissertation explores confessional tropes as narrative, dialogic, and patient-centered healing in late Middle English secular literature. She has recently published articles in
            ArthurianaandThe Once and Future Classroom, and has a forthcoming review inMedievally Speaking. In summer 2013, she curated an exhibit titled “Eugène Vinaver's MagnificentMalory” for the Rossell Hope Robbins Library. Her budding interest in Gower studies has resulted in a recent flurry of activity: her co-organizing of the 3rdInternational Congress of the John Gower Society in summer 2014 and her selection by JGS as the graduate student representative for the 2016 John Hurt Fisher Prize Committee. At her home institution, she serves as Assistant Editor of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, works as a library assistant for the Robbins Library, contributes to theCamelot Project, and teaches in the Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program.

Abstract: Recently in environmental ethics some theorists have advocated narrative accounts of value, according to which the value of environmental goods is given by the role that they play in our narratives. I first sketch the basic theoretical features of a narrative accounts of value and then go on to raise some problems for such views. I claim that they require an evaluative standard in order to distinguish the valuable from the merely valued and that the project of constructing such a standard faces significant problems. I conclude by questioning whether narrative accounts of value really offer advantages over other pluralistic and context-sensitive accounts of value.<br>

Abstract: Violent appropriation of sovereignty and the articulation of the experience of oppression are also at issue in M. NourbeSe Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongue, Her Silence Softly Breaks. Philip, a Canadian poet born in Moriah, Trinidad and Tobago, addresses the silencing and sexual assault of women in conjunction with colonial history in the Americas. The Ovidian figure of Philomela, who was raped and had her tongue torn out so that she could not relate what had happened to her, is central toShe Tries Her Tongue. Persephone's search for Ceres is another major theme. Philip foregrounds the problem of “the mother tongue” as she reworks Ovidian myths with excerpts from invented didactic texts (such as language tests, which are akin to those of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha'sDicteeor Myung-Mi Kim'sCommons, both of which also problematize language acquisition as an engine of hegemony). Some invented texts offer recommendations for the treatment of slaves: “Edict II: Every slave caught speaking his native language shall be severely punished. Where necessary, removal of the tongue is recommended. The offending organ, when removed, should be hung on high in a central place, so that all may see and tremble” (“Discourse on the Logic of Language”).
               Philip destabilizes the notion of a linguistically unified Caribbean history by mixing genres and weaving the demotic with Latin citations, as McMorris notes: “It's difficult to tell at first glance whether or not the poet has invented her ‘quoted’ texts, and this keeps things unsettled, shadowy, and undecided. In the later poems of the book, where the imitation of other genres takes place, we hover between belief and doubt, unable without a quantity of research to separate the fabrication from the real. It's as if Philip wants to contaminate the library of Western disciplines—founded in the Latin language—by destroying our confidence in the truth of its texts.”125

Abstract: Throughout her book, Apter makes a forceful case for the need to understand the “world” in World Literature as both politically and linguistically fraught, and she echoes Gayatri Spivak and others in arguing that World Literature's “ethic of liberal inclusiveness … often has the collateral effect of blunting political critique” (41). As she says in a chapter on “Dispossessive Collectivism,” World Literature needs to be more than a project of “curatorial salvage,” a mere museum of words without borders that “gathers up swaths of literary culture deemed vulnerable to extinction and performs preservational intervention” (326). Her pursuit of these themes takes Apter from the novels of Pynchon and DeLillo to the work of the Palestinian/American conceptual artist Emily Jacir, and the volume includes a cautionary essay on “Checkpoints and Sovereign Borders” (99–114) and a brief but suggestive chapter on the problematic extension of European historical categories to areas far beyond Europe (“Eurochronology and Periodicity,” 57–69). In terms of translation studies, Apter offers a counter-narrative to the celebratory accounts by practitioners such as Edith Grossman or David Bellos (19–20), giving extended exegeses of work on translation theory by Derrida and several thinkers in his wake, and exploring case studies including the complex history of an English translation of
      Madame Bovaryby Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor, later revised by Paul and Patricia de Man.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's particular structural and stylistic approach to nostalgia in
         Gatsby, dividing the narrative into two distinct parts and thus creating both a textual nostalgia and evoking a phenomenological nostalgic experience in the reader, are masterly and consciously accomplished, but they are not unique. Modernist writers used a palette of nostalgic strategies in order to stage their experience of the modern world. Although nostalgia can be considered conservative or reactionary as an idea, the influence it had on modernist literary style is, on the contrary, quite radical. “The melancholic sense of loss,” writes Svetlana Boym, “turned into a style” (16). The sense of transcendental homelessness in combination with nihilism and universal grief that was accentuated by the war and contemporary ideas necessitated a literary style that both confronted the whole project of progress as well as provided a space for emotions that were not considered desirable in a world moving distinctly forward. The nostalgic aesthetic is heavily based on strategies that are formed out of the basic nostalgic and modern dichotomy between future and past, now and then, here and there, which included such varied techniques as temporal re-ordering of events, the nostalgic use of both flashbacks and flash-forwards, the dichotomy between inner time and clock time. Furthermore, the modernists favored inner or outer landscapes of utopian and idealized spaces. Such landscapes could be either simply another past, or more intricately, a phenomenological experience of childhood.<br>

Abstract: Psychoanalysis gives us a way of addressing the tension between ethics and politics that springs the trap of this double bind. The pledge of psychoanalysis is to critically examine how we project our unconscious fears and desires onto others whom we call foreigners, enemies, monsters, deserving some form of death penalty. It commands us to investigate how we distribute dignity, equality, and respect such that some profit while others pay the price. The psychoanalytic supplement binds ethics to politics without appeals to the soveriegnty of the will or of God but, rather, through the interminable process of analyzing the ways in which we disavow and avow our investments in violence and cruelty.<br>

Abstract: On the one hand, here and elsewhere Brentano appears to prefer a sense of the awareness of the I's individuation as a third-person reflective knowing of infima species or a definite description that of necessity involves relating to and contrasting with others—but this is not possibly delivered in one's first-personal inner perception of oneself. On the other hand, he believes at the same time that inner perception accounts for the intuitive prima facie conviction of our unique individuality and further holds not only that inner perception is a result of our having immediate evidence of our identity with ourselves but also that this is a knowledge or acquaintance that is
            per seand notper accidens; in other words, it is a knowledge pertaining to oneself as oneself.
                  Here perhaps we have an incipient theory of the distinctive self-awareness of persons as spirits based on his theory of self-awareness as17
               per seknowing, which, as I noted, has, as inner perception, flawed formulations that undermine the project.<br>

Abstract: A second strategy is Grosz's desubjectivation of memory: “Matter and life are thus not opposites, binary pairs (plus or minus vital force), but intimately implicated in each other, different degrees of one and the same force. Life is matter extended into the virtual; matter is life compressed into dormancy. Life erupts from (and transforms) the material conditions that enable matter to ‘remember’” (2011, 20). Focusing on memory as material event, I place Grosz's work alongside that of Paul Cilliers, author of the 1998 book
         Complexity and Postmodernism. Cilliers defines “memory” as a “physical condition of the brain: which pathways are breached (‘facilitated’) and which are not. Memory is not a cognitive function performed by a conscious subject, but an unconscious characteristic of the brain (which is an organ, part of the body). Memory is the substrate that sets up the conditions for all the functions of the brain” (1998, 45–46). Memory is a distributed pattern of valences across a complex system. It is an essential aspect of complex systems open to their environments, Cilliers maintains, because it offers resistance to environmental changes. Repeated patterns of distribution strengthen the connectedness of various nodes or elements involved in a given systemic pattern; repetition intensifies some networks at the expense of others. Without these transformations, an open system would simply mirror its environment (Cilliers1998, 92). However, such systems do not simply project immediate environmental inputs or conditions. Rather, in some configurations, matter retains or repeats patterns resulting from past stimulation; in some configurations, matterremembers. When it does, it differs from its environment while remaining fully within the impact and draw of whatever surrounds it. This differing is what enables a material system to organize itself, differing further from but responding constantly to its environment. Memory is not representation; Cilliers write~<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: For Levinas, the liberation of God from Being was the definition of “ethics,” which Levinas himself called “metaphysics.” Levinas meant that ethics alone breaks the crust of Being, which he called the sphere of the “same.” The ethical other breaches what we comprehend and pre-have in advance and exposes us to the “wholly other,” by which he meant not God but the “face” of the neighbor or the stranger, which is the “trace” that God leaves behind in withdrawing from the world (Being). Levinas radicalizes the ethics of neighborly love and hospitality in the Jewish Scriptures, by means of which he thought “first philosophy” could be revitalized and ethics returned to center stage in Continental thinking, a project in which he broadly succeeded. Marion's trope, “without Being,” is structurally similar to Levinas's, but Marion really does mean God (the God of the mystical theology of the Christian neo-Platonists), whom he approaches in an ingenious series of three “reductions” in the Husserlian sense: first of transcendental subjectivity (Kant and Husserl), then of existential agency (Dasein), and finally of Being itself. The upshot of reduction is to release the givenness (
            Gegebenheit) of what he calls the “saturated phenomenon.” By this he means the phenomenon untethered from prior limiting conditions, which is free to be given in a flood ofdonationthat overwhelms the conceptual resources of the one to whom it is given (theadonné). Reversing orthodox Husserlianism, the givenness of the saturated phenomenon exceeds the intentional act.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: It seems to me that, at this point, Janicaud's argument still remains incomplete. He has suggested that phenomenology can and should be transformed in order to accommodate Deleuzian insights. But why wouldn't hermeneutics be the discourse by which this passage from Deleuze to phenomenology is made? If the worry has to do with Deleuze's suspicions of its priestly residues, why couldn't one perform a transformation of the hermeneutical project similar to Janicaud's transformation of the phenomenological project?
         
               In light of these questions, I want to construct what I would imagine to be, if not Ricoeur's own view, at least a Ricoeurian reply whose aim is to show that hermeneutics provides the resources needed for carrying out Janicaud's minimal phenomenology.20<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An example of this function within philosophical discourse can be found in Derrida's
         Writing and Difference, which also happens to be the work of his that contains the most explicit discussion of hyperbole. He writes:
               He further asserts that hyperbole “cannot be enclosed in a factual and determined historical structure, for it is the project of exceeding every finite and determined totality” (1978, 60). First, Derrida uses hyperbole to make his argument. Through
                  
            At its heighthyperbole, the absolute opening, the uneconomic expenditure, is always reembraced by aneconomyand is overcome by economy. The relationship between reason, madness, and death is an economy, a structure of deferral whose irreducible originality must be respected. This attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole is not an attempt among others; it is not an attempt which would occasionally and eventually be completed by the saying of it, or by its object, the direct object of a willful subjectivity. This attempt to say, which is not, moreover, the antagonism of silence, but rather the condition for it, is the original profundity of will in general. (1978, 61–62)incrementum, he builds his position with three “(it) is not” statements and two “this attempt to say” statements. This use ofamplificatioculminates in suggesting that the attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole is the “original profundity of will in general.” Second, as a figure of thought, Derrida invokes the attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole as the overall project of uneconomic expenditure. Paradoxically, even though he posits that hyperbole exceeds “every finite and determined totality,” he also argues that it is always reeconomized even “at its heights.” This is a stark contradiction, and it is one that is supported by the function of hyperbolic errancy.<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Ricoeur's understanding of “appropriation.” One of the advantages of Ricoeur's formulation is that it recognizes the significance of readerly agency while not relying on the idea of a self-possessed subject. Ricoeur argues that appropriation should not be understood as a function of a sovereign subject who “would possess the key” to understanding. Rather, the reader of a text “exchange[s] the
         me,masterof itself, for theself,discipleof the text” (Ricoeur 2007, 37). Such a reader does not project him- or herself onto the text but receives “an enlarged self from the apprehension of proposed worlds which are the genuine object of interpretation” (Ricoeur1981, 182). The ability to perform this function depends on what Ricoeur calls “second-order reference,” which requires the reader to suspend concerns with whether the events “really” happened in order fully to understand the world opening up through her or his imaginative engagement with the text (Ricoeur1977, 216–56).
               This “world of the work” that reveals itself before the text becomes the referent of fictional narrative. When engaged in interpretation, then, the reader should seek to understand this “proposed world” as one “which I could inhabit and in which I could project my ownmost possibilities” (Ricoeur 2007, 36). Fictional narratives, then, ultimately create an imagined world that prepares readers to act their way into it, so to speak. In13
            Time and Narrative, Ricoeur explains that historical narrative employs a related but distinct “referential mode”: whereas fiction refers to an imagined world that could potentially be enacted in front of it, so to speak, historical narrative also claims to refer to an actual world that already exists behind it (1984, 1:82). Ricoeur productively blurs these distinctions inMemory, History, Forgetting, explaining that both types of narrative enable the reader to inhabit the “world of the text” (2004, 262).<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Publisher: Cambridge UP<br>
Issue: style.36.issue-1<br>
Date: February 25, 1984<br>
Author(s): Alber Jan<br>
Abstract: In
         Towards a ‘Natural’ Narratology(1996), Monika Fludernik reconstitutes narrativity on the basis of experientiality, i.e., humanity's embodiedness in the world, and claims that incomprehensible texts can be made more readable if one attempts to narrativize them. Since Samuel Beckett's short prose work “Lessness” is one of the most enigmatic texts of the twentieth century, it serves as an ideal test case for this new narratological paradigm. “Lessness” does indeed lose its initial strangeness if one reads this piece as narrative. Moreover, although a “natural” narratological analysis paves the way for a new interpretation of “Lessness,” the new paradigm provides only a partially satisfying analysis of it. To make the text fit into the new consciousness-oriented paradigm, Fludernik's quasi-universal naturalizing mode has to ignore certain aspects such as the mechanical structure of “Lessness.” Beckett's later prose work challenges narrativization and the “natural” narratological project. A reading of “Lessness” should be liberated from the confines of experientiality and instead concentrate on the role of chance and chaos. Beckett's text must be located in a counterworld, a limbo between signifier and signified. One should allow this limbo world to seep into the “real world” and not attempt to explain this different counterworld by means of “real-world” knowledge.<br>

Abstract: The great builder of worlds denounces his own project—and therefore every totalizing, world-building literary or political enterprise, be it historical (epic) or fantastical (Utopian): “you have reared your disunited kingdom on the vacuum of your own most intensely doubtful soul.”
         
               
            134
            Ulyssesdoes not transcend the dystopian paralysis ofDubliners;
               but in the euphoria of Bloomsday it may take135
            Finnegans Waketo remind us of that.Ulyssesis a mock epic in the same way thatA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manis mock-epiphanic: the young Stephen Dedalus's eager epiphanies—of family, sexuality, religion, romance, and philosophy—ultimately (when confronted with material circumstances) do not quite attain the transcendental climaxes he might have expected of them.Ulysses's Utopian cornucopia might thereby be seen as eventually as anticlimactic asDubliners's exotic dreams—the “Eastern enchantment” of “Araby.”
               But that would be to impose a closure upon136
            Ulysses—or, for that matter, uponFinnegans Wake—that the text stridently resists. It is not that these texts fail to attain their visions; it is just that they have not done so yet. Their endings (if they can be said to have endings) are therefore not so much anticlimactic as affirmingly preclimactic. As such, they seem to represent a mode of that “foreplay” that Jacques Derrida sees as the province of literary pleasures. But while Derrida views such textual pleasure as “null and endless,”
               Joyce's later work might be characterized as endless (which is not to say directionless) and full: an inexhaustible crescendo of Barthesian137

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: The crossroads of the end of Utopia (apparently ensured by the fall of the Berlin Wall and Soviet Russia), the end of the world (apparently easier to imagine than an alternative to capitalism), and capitalism itself (which is apparently eternal) seems an apt place to turn toward the problem of degenerate Utopia and the city, which, after all, pretty much amount to the same thing in our time. Louis Marin's proposition is that “a degenerate utopia is ideology changed into the form of a myth.”
         
               Arguably, one such myth is capitalism. Another might be modernity or modernism, and a third could be the inevitability of the contemporary city as the concretization of capitalist realism. However, the cities that most of us inhabit could conceivably be construed as Utopias by neoliberals, as constituting the best of all possible worlds for the spread of free markets, or equally so by anti-utopians, who might see in the modern city Utopia realized, that is, dystopia. In any event, and whatever one's preconceived notion of Utopia might be, the contemporary city stands primarily as confirmation “of the impotence of corporate capital to generate a socially cohesive environment.”29
            
               As such, it is also arguably no Utopia, which persists as an open project to be imagined and realized, sometime and somewhere in the future, in the footsteps of present efforts to define Utopia for architecture and the city and to establish its spaces.30<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>

The films by Marceline Loridan-Ivens and Robert Thalheim focus on future generations and their ability to relate to the Holocaust in an ethical way that avoids the problems of traumatization and commodification that mark earlier Holocaust film and commercial cinema, respectively.<br>
