  Abstract: In Philadelphia on May 10, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson addressed a group of four thousand newly naturalized citizens. While Wilson delivered the address mere days after the sinking of the

  Abstract: Traumatic violence has caught Oedipus in an ongoing repetition of mimetic rivalry, rooting him in an eternal present. Compellingly demonstrated not only in
                  Oedipus the Kingbut also inOedipus at Colonus, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

It begins, literally and figuratively, with a prelude, and dwells on the minute particulars of both the music and its performance. The idea is to embark in medias res without too firm a sense of ultimate direction.

  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

The comparison of Levinas and Marcel has, to be sure, been interesting in terms of addressing the perplexing incompatibility of two philosophers who are in many ways quite similar. Moreover, tracing the development of these divergent accounts of otherness to the theological soil in which they are rooted is significant both in terms of understanding Levinas and Marcel, and in terms of a broader grasp of the way in which<br>

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

  Abstract: From their origins, the Abrahamic faiths have placed a high premium on transmitting religious identity from one generation to the next. Yet each of the traditions has developed its own methods for religious training. That’s why an opportunity for educators from different faith traditions and professional disciplines to come together holds special promise.

The second takes up practical extensions of Royce's work, bringing his ideas and methods to bear on contemporary philosophical matters. Among the topics addressed are the paradoxes of individualism; loyalty, democracy, and community; Royce's efforts to respond to historical American racism; his contributions to engaged inter-faith religious discourse; the promise of his theory of error for a feminist account of knowledge; and his ethics of loyalty as a component in medical ethics.<br>

  Book Title: Hegemony-The New Shape Of Global Power<br>
  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Agnew John<br>
  Abstract: Hegemonytells the story of the drive to create consumer capitalism abroad through political pressure and the promise of goods for mass consumption. In contrast to the recent literature on America as empire, it explains that the primary goal of the foreign and economic policies of the United States is a world which increasingly reflects the American way of doing business, not the formation or management of an empire. Contextualizing both the Iraq war and recent plant closings in the U.S., noted author John Agnew shows how American hegemony has created a world in which power is no longer only shaped territorially. He argues in a sobering conclusion that we are consequently entering a new era of global power, one in which the world the US has made no longer works to its singular advantage.<br>

  Book Title: Joy and Human Flourishing-Essays on Theology, Culture, and the Good Life<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Volf Miroslav<br>
  Abstract: Joy is crucial to human life and central to God’s relationship to the world, yet it is remarkably absent from contemporary theology and, increasingly, from our own lives! This collection, the result of a series of consultations hosted by the Yale Center of Faith and Culture, remedies this situation by considering the import of joy on human flourishing. These essays—written by experts in systematic and pastoral theology, Christian ethics, and biblical studies—demonstrate the promise of joy to throw open new theological possibilities and cast fresh light on all dimensions of human life. With contributions from Jurgen Moltmann, N. T. Wright, Marianne Meye Thompson, Mary Clark Moschella, Charles Mathewes, and Miroslav Volf, this volume puts joy at the heart of Christian faith and life, exploring joy’s biblical, dogmatic, ecclesiological, and ethical dimensions in concert with close attention to the shifting tides of culture. Convinced of the need to offer to the world a compelling Christian vision of the good life, the authors treat the connections between joy and themes of creation, theodicy, politics, suffering, pastoral practice, eschatology, and more, driven by the conviction that vital relationship with the living God is integral to our fullest flourishing as human creatures.<br>

  Abstract: The Insistence of God presents the provocative idea that God does not exist, God insists, while God's existence is a human responsibility, which may or may not happen. For John D. Caputo, God's existence is haunted by "perhaps," which does not signify indecisiveness but an openness to risk, to the unforeseeable. Perhaps constitutes a theology of what is to come and what we cannot see coming. Responding to current critics of continental philosophy, Caputo explores the materiality of perhaps and the promise of the world. He shows how perhaps can become a new theology of the gaps God opens.<br>

  Abstract: The title of this work comes from a closing line in Heidegger’s
                     Being and Time. He is speaking of the future of phenomenology as a promise of things to come—a sentiment already anticipated in an opening claim of the book: “In phenomenology possibility stands higher than actuality.”¹ For Heidegger this spelled a revolutionary reversal of the old metaphysical paradigm of being as presence, substance, and act and a radical openness to new kinds of questioning.<br>

  Abstract: In biblical Israel’s narrative, there is a telling of God’s identity that is not finally reducible to a mere expression of “normal” religion’s apprehension of deity. This chapter further explicates Jenson’s understanding of this “telling,” of Israel’s history, and the manner in which this drama makes and shapes the gospel promise. In addition, while aspects of Jenson’s account of the God of Israel’s intimate dealings with this people are relatively conventional, others have attracted considerable criticism. This extrapolation seeks to draw attention to innovation and locate Jenson’s characteristic moves within the conceptual nexus that integrates his system, highlighting their significance<br>

  Book Title: The Postmodern Bible-The Bible and Culture Collective<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wuellner Wilhelm<br>
  Abstract: The burgeoning use of modern literary theory and cultural criticism in recent biblical studies has led to stimulating-but often bewildering-new readings of the Bible. This book, argued from a perspective shaped by postmodernism, is at once an accessible guide to and an engagement with various methods, theories, and critical practices transforming biblical scholarship today.Written by a collective of cutting-edge scholars-with each page the work of multiple hands-
      The Postmodern Bibledeliberately breaks with the individualist model of authorship that has traditionally dominated scholarship in the humanities and is itself an illustration of the postmodern transformation of biblical studies for which it argues.The book introduces, illustrates, and critiques seven prominent strategies of reading. Several of these interpretive strategies-rhetorical criticism, structuralism and narratology, reader-response criticism, and feminist criticism-have been instrumental in the transformation of biblical studies up to now. Many-feminist and womanist criticism, ideological criticism, poststructuralism, and psychoanalytic criticism-hold promise for the continued transformation of these studies in the future. Focusing on readings from both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, this volume illuminates the current multidisciplinary debates emerging from postmodernism by exposing the still highly contested epistemological, political, and ethical positions in the field of biblical studies.<br>

The chapters in this collection pose questions, unsettle assumptions, and generate broad imaginative spaces for thinking about representation of pregnancy, birth, and parenting. They demonstrate the ways in which practices of consuming and using representations carry within them the productive forces of creation. Bringing together an eclectic and vibrant range of perspectives, this collection offers readers the possibility to rethink and reimagine the diverse meanings and practices of representations of these significant life events. Engaging theoretical reflection and creative image making, the contributors explore a broad range of cultural signs with a focus on challenging authoritative representations in a manner that seeks to reveal rather than conceal the insistently problematic and contestable nature of image culture. Natal Signs gathers an exciting set of critically engaged voices to reflect on some of life’s most meaningful moments in ways that affirm natality as the renewed promise of possibility.Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production.

  Abstract: Comments and claims, such as the preceding by Francis Collins, as well as reports about newly located genes, appear with increasing frequency in the media these days. The sociologist Alan Peterson argues that such stories are deemed newsworthy “precisely because they offer people the promise of being able to re-make themselves anew—to ‘play God’—so that they can better deal with, if not overcome, the reality of disease, disability and death” (2001, 267). Because of the possibility that such stories may bring about changes in individual behaviors, Peterson insists that it is important to investigate how “gene stories” selectively<br>

  Abstract: The term “liberalism” has always enjoyed a separate existence away from the constricting, formal, and austere world of political concepts and theories. To be liberal evokes generosity, tolerance, compassion, being fired up with the promise of open, unbounded spaces within which the free play of personality can be aired. Yet the clues to liberalism’s political nature are not hard to detect. Generosity suggests the dispensing of bounties beyond the call of duty—to prioritise justice as the first liberal virtue is unnecessarily reductionist. Tolerance suggests a flexibility, a movement, a diversity—of ideas, of language, and of conceptual content—that<br>

  Abstract: Our presentist present is by no means uniform or clear-cut, and it is experienced very differently depending on the position we occupy in society. We are caught up in global movement and accelerated flows, or else condemned to the life of casual workers, living from hand to mouth in a stagnant present, with no recognized past, and no real future either (since the temporality of plans and projects is inaccessible). The present is therefore experienced as emancipation or enclosure, and the perspective of the future is no longer reassuring, since it is perceived not as a promise, but as a threat. Hartog's resonant readings show us how the motor of history(-writing) has stalled and help us understand the contradictory qualities of our contemporary presentist relation to time.<br>

  Book Title: The Highway of Despair-Critical Theory After Hegel<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: The Highway of Despairfollows Theodor Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon as they each read, resist, and reconfigure a strand of thought in Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit. Confronting the twentieth-century collapse of a certain revolutionary dialectic, these thinkers struggle to revalue critical philosophy and recast Left Hegelianism within the contexts of genocidal racism, world war, and colonial domination. Each thinker also re-centers the role of passion in critique. Arguing against more recent trends in critical theory that promise an escape from despair, Marasco shows how passion frustrates the resolutions of reason and faith. Embracing the extremism of what Marx, in the spirit of Hegel, called the "ruthless critique of everything existing," she affirms the contemporary purchase of radical critical theory, resulting in a passionate approach to political thought.<br>

He describes this most private work of Heidegger's philosophy as "a dissonant symphony that imperfectly weaves together its moments into a vast fugue, under the leitmotif of appropriation. This fugue is seeded with possibilities that are waiting for us, its listeners, to develop them. Some are dead ends-viruses that can lead only to a monolithic, monotonous misunderstanding of history.

  Abstract: In considering the ancient art of rhetoric’s passion for classification, Roland Barthes observes, “
                  tell me how you classify and I’ll tell you who you are.” This gnomic promise suggests that we can discover a certain truth of identity in the taxonomic decisions made by different rhetorical cultures. Barthes clarifies this declaration by writing that “the taxonomic option implies an ideological one: there is always a stake in where things are placed,” and he later calls taxonomic variation the “place of place.”¹ I have been arguing that the “place” of vernacular rhetoric must be understood as England, and Barthes’ reflections on<br>

  Abstract: For many eighteenth-century thinkers, happiness was a revolutionary new idea filled with the promise of the Enlightenment. However, Vivasvan Soni argues that the period fails to establish the importance of happiness as a guiding idea for human practice, generating our modern sentimental idea of happiness.

  Abstract: “Happiness is a new idea in Europe,” boasted Robespierre’s colleague Saint-Just in 1794.¹ He believed that the new era in human history ushered in by the American and French revolutions in the eighteenth century was characterized by an unprecedented attention to secular happiness as a political project. For Saint-Just the promise of the Enlightenment and the goal of revolutionary aspiration was comprehended in the word “happiness.” Contemporary scholars have by and large concurred with Saint-Just’s assessment. The eighteenth century, they claim, conferred respectability on the pursuit of secular happiness as no other period before it. Indeed, eighteenth-century thinkers, not satisfied<br>

Abstract: We are using the “vocabularies” and “codes” concepts for reasons beyond their capacities to illuminate aspects of our cases. Both are prominent in recent scholarship, and both have been applied empirically and developed further by scholars other than the originators. If the concept of group style fulfills its promise of “sensitizing” (Blumer
            1986) us to something we might have overlooked, it will systematically distinguish between two different enactments of the “same” vocabulary, or code, without writing off those enactments as inscrutable or ad hoc improvisation.<br>

Abstract: But the implicit promise of a paradigm in which the questions were defined by anthropology was not entirely fulfilled. Hymess program had an ambiguous relationship with cultural anthropology as it moved into the latters territory (e.g., with the ethnography of ritual events) without managing to produce a volume of empirical research that could either compete with or more fully complement sociocultural anthropologists steady stream of monographlength ethnographies. Joel Sherzers (
         1983)Kuna Ways of Speaking: An Ethnographic Perspectivewas the exception rather than the norm. The program also lacked obvious connections with biological and archaeological anthropology, especially because of its exclusion of evolution. Although Hymes himself had discussed the evolution of language earlier in his career (Hymes1961), none of his students did so. This separated adherents of the second paradigm from anthropologists who were pursuing a universal and evolutionary explanation of certain domains of human languages, especially in the lexicon (e.g., Berlin1975, Berlin and Kay1969, Witkowski and Brown1978). Despite the explicit adoption of an evolutionary agenda9and an antirelativistic stance (contrary to the Boasian legacy), contributions such as Berlin and Kays (1969) comparative survey of color terminology shared more features with the first paradigm than with the second. At the methodological level, Berlin and Kay continued to rely, as did Sapir and the scholars who called themselves anthropological linguists, on informant work to elicit linguistic forms (i.e., lexical items) instead of documenting the use of such forms in specific speech events. At the theoretical level, they continued to interpret linguistic relativity as pertaining to linguistic classification (first paradigm) rather than extending it to the realm of linguistic activities as suggested by Hymes (1966) (second paradigm). Finally, the absence from their work of contextual variation is incompatible with ~<br>

Abstract: Robbins specifies these failures by showing how two great attempts at philosophical theology fell short. On the one hand, Dietrich Bonhoeffer pushed theology toward a philosophical theology that would repair the Barthian disjunction of theology and philosophy and avoid posing the alternative of deciding categorically between either God or world. Bonhoeffer’s attempt falls short, however, when he bases his ethics on a wisdom that sees the world through the truth of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, the path of phenomenology has gone in the opposite direction: from a transcendental idealism (the early Edmund Husserl, for whom philosophy should be pure of ontology or theology) to engagement with history and the world (Heidegger and the later Husserl, whose attention to the life‐world brings philosophy into the world of history and actuality that animates it, even if the promise of this engagement is not often seized).<br>

Abstract: Of the five grand challenges that Michael Buckland sets for library research [
      1], possibly the most challenging will be the effort needed to revitalize library theory [2]. In a major contribution to this emerging conversation, John Budd gives a philosophical framework for knowledge and knowing in library and information science (LIS); he advocates phenomenological hermeneutics for theory development in LIS [3]. However, in the kind of analysis that he undertakes to arrive at this preferred stance, one of the quieter voices in philosophy tends to be overlooked. Process philosophy, which is “a position whose insights show ample promise of increasing philosophical utility” [4, p. 3], is worthy of consideration if we are looking for new and fresh ideas in LIS. My purpose in this article is to consider how process philosophy is situated as a living tradition among other philosophies and why some recent developments in this tradition have relevance in LIS.<br>

Abstract: I want to focus here specifically on questions of race and appropriation, particularly brought to light by bell hooks’s criticism of
         Paris Is Burning, to which Butler responds (see hooks1992, 145–56). Butler considers the ways in which drag is a site that questions the manner in which hegemonic heterosexuality reproduces itself through imitation and performance. Reading the desire on the part of Venus Xtravaganza, the drag queen who is the subject ofParis Is Burning, to become a “real” woman, and drag performance as a “contesting of realness” (1993, 130), Butler argues that such performances expose the norms that regulate realness and also the fact that “norms of realness by which the subject is produced are racially informed conceptions of ‘sex’” (1993, 130). hooks’s critique of the film centers on director Jennie Livingston’s role as a white lesbian woman ethnographer photographing subjects of color but imperialistically concealing her own standpoint in the film. Butler accedes to the problem of the raced gaze but offers a reading that presents itself as problematically analogical. Butler writes, “hooks is right to argue that within this culture the ethnographic conceit of a neutral gaze will always be a white gaze. … But what does it mean to think about this camera as an instrument and effect of lesbian desire?” (1993, 136). In other words, Butler rewrites the question of race as a question of sexuality, the underlying assumption being that one can be substituted for the other. Thus, although Butler suggests that to an extent the camera assumes the place of the phallus, she suggests that the cinematic gaze is not simply white and phallicbecausethe occasion of drag balls constructs kinship relations outside the heterosexual family. Being outside heterosexuality, by analogy, means being outside whiteness. Butler writes, “If the signifiers of whiteness and femaleness … are sites of phantasmatic promise, then it is clear that women of color and lesbians are ~<br>

Abstract: At the same time, however, the image of the Creator still beckons from within; the Creator’s voice can still be heard. The possibility for the imitation of Creation is not altogether lost but hidden and now indirect. This ambiguity can be illustrated by Adam and Eve’s joint invention of clothing, their very first postfall act. The loincloths, hastily stitched together, cover over human generative difference. But at the same time, they indicate humanity’s persisting if corrupted capability, in the imitation of God, for creating together with one another something altogether new. Clothing is (symbolically speaking) a creative solution to humanity’s shame at social difference. The moral tension that each of us actually experiences with others and in society is not only all too inevitably divisive and destructive but also, and ultimately, the grounds for the promise and hope of social relations that are radically new.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The problem that Ricoeur relentlessly puts forth in his final chapter is that of the asymmetry of agents in the process of recognition. Like the making of a promise, one party is in debt, while the other is in demand. And contrary to appearances, neither the act of recognizing nor the act of promising end once the demand or the promise is fulfilled. Ricoeur insists on the moral motivations that bring together the recognizing and the recognized party. At the end of the book, these moral motivations are analyzed under the triple heading of states of peace, gift exchange, and mutual recognition. Here, recognition takes the form of “gratitude,” as exemplified by festive undertakings of recognition. The virtues of giving and of receiving are real, and they express, in the eyes of Ricoeur, the limits of an always asymmetrical recognition bounded by peace and gratitude.<br>

Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Wall claims that “moral life is inherently creative” and that this fact “demands a fundamental rethinking of the nature and meaning of moral life itself” (vii). For Wall, creativity is a possibility that is primordial to human being, ultimately expressing humans’ imitation of the creative power of God. The importance of creativity has been covered over by a tendency in the West to separate poetics from ethics. Wall aims to remedy this lack by explicating moral creativity as the capacity to invent an ever more inclusive vision of life. This moral creativity is developed in stages, from the being of the moral self as a creative tension of freedom and finitude (chap. 1), to the capacity of humans to bring narrative unity to their moral lives (chap. 2), through the poetic response demanded by otherness (chap. 3), to the creation of ideologies and utopias in social life (chap. 4). As an original contribution to moral reflection, this book has much to recommend it. While it is certainly not unusual today to see a call for ethics to become poetic, in postmodernism this usually means abandoning ethical reflection in favor of poetic invention of self or community. Wall manages instead to link poetic creativity to philosophical reflection, making creativity the symbolic ground of discourses of philosophical anthropology, teleological and deontological ethics, and social critical/liberationist thought. Wall’s use of specific narratives is likewise fruitful: tragedy is used for reflection on the status of moral evil and limitation, while the biblical creation story is interpreted to symbolize the potentialities of creativity. In sum, the book delivers on its promise to heal the divide between poetics and ethics, rather than simply replacing ethics with poetics.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If a particular conception of the future proves no longer capable of exercising its pull on the present, the spell cast by the phrases “our modernity,” and “history itself” is finally broken and the present is released from playing the role of shaping experience according to expectations promising the achievement of progressive perfectibility. I am not suggesting, as contemporary endists do, that the temporality of the future, as such, has been evicted from our historical horizon or has been realized, thus putting an end to history. While there have been appeals to a triumphal end of history after the cold war and dire predictions of a present that now portends ecological disaster, not to mention the fraudulent promise to end the threat of terrorism itself, presentism is not the same as the simple present any more than an indeterminate and unknowable future is synonymous with futurism. Yet too often these temporal dimensions have been misrecognized, out of ambition, desire, and menace, in an effort to invest with meaning, purpose, and even direction the outcomes of the present and future. The most familiar marker of the experience upheld by presentism and futurism has invariably pointed to either an achieved or completed modernity (as well as its “alternative”) or the aspiration of a utopia yet to come. In some instances, abrupt changes opened upon a future filled with either possibility or peril and destruction. Too often such demands, whatever the political motivation, have aimed at overcoming a present both dominated by the processes of capitalism, as Marx demonstrated, and by its “rhythms” and “symmetries,” as described by Georg Simmel. With fascism, it is well to recall, there was an inordinate promise to save capitalism from itself and from liberalism, whereas communism sought to rid capitalism entirely from historical society.<br>

Abstract: This is the clearest signal that, for Smith, Enoch represents an antecedent to the Abrahamic covenant that “I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee” (see Genesis 17 and 22:15–18). For extension of the Abrahamic covenant to the Christian movement, see, e.g., Luke 16:22–23 (the righteous to rest in the bosom of Abraham) and Gal. 3:8 and 29 (through Christ, the Gentiles become the seed of Abraham and “heirs according to the promise”). For Smith’s elaboration on this covenant, see the Book of Abraham 2.<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against this argument the Vedānta
         siddhāntinaffirms the material causality of brahman by reaffirming principles that, if taken on their own, readily lend themselves to a Sāṃkhya interpretation. He appeals to the principle of the nondifference (ananyatva,avyatirekatva) of cause and effect, presupposed in Uddālaka Āruṇī’s promise, in Chāndogya 6, to impart to Śvetaketu a knowledge of that by which all else is known (ekena vijñānena sarvam anyad avijñātam api vijñātaṃ bhavati).43A little later, following up on sutra I.4.26’s mention of the principle of modification (ātmakṛteḥ pariṇāmāt), he argues that brahman causes himself to be transformed (pariṇamayām āsa‐ātmānam) as the innermost nature of the resultant modifications.44Śaṅkara is fully aware that the affirmation of brahman’s material causality in a context presupposing his agency renders the nature of brahman’s causality incomprehensible. He concludes this section by declaring irrelevant the opponent’s argument that deliberative causality appears in the world only with respect to efficient causes. Empirical experience is not decisive here, for brahman is not an object of inference.45<br>

Abstract: “I chose this story above all others because it’s a story I’m struggling to end. … That’s why I write fiction—so that I can keep telling the story. … Always a new beginning, a different end,” Winterson writes toward the close of her narrative (
         2005, 137). Linking the desire for retelling with the inability to formulate a conclusion and the necessity for an open ending, Winterson has Atlas walk away, yet presents this “very particular end not found elsewhere” (xiv) as but one possibility among several, the choice of which is ultimately left to the individual reader’s personal preference: “no one knows its composition,” Winterson observes. “Dark matter could be conventional matter, … or it could even be black holes. Or it could be Atlas holding up the universe. But I think it is Atlas and Laïka walking away” (2005, 151).Weight’s multiperspectival ending underscores its status as inaugural retelling of myth for a twenty‐first century that can only assimilate more pasts into its ever broadening present. In this sense, the Myths seems typical for the contemporary take on re‐vision. Whereas the names of the authors hold the promise of retellings with a critical edge—Achebe having given usThings Fall Apartas a reply to and a thorough undermining of Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darkness(see Moyers1989; Achebe1990), and neither Atwood nor Winterson is a stranger to rewriting as cultural critique—Winterson’s phrase and its appropriation by the series’ editor make us suspect differently. “We want to tell the story again,” as the series’ editor Jamie Byng puts it on Canongate’s Web site, speaks of the storyteller’s desire for and delight in language; of the pleasure of telling stories, of keeping the stories alive by retelling them. Inevitably also meaning “we want tosellthe story again,” retelling becomes a retailing strategy, promising ever new and improved reading experiences that are as ephemeral as any other consumer experience.

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Another problem is the book’s unrelenting abstractness. As noted above, issues of nonviolence, solidarity, and dialogue seem to be hovering in the background, but never once does Reynolds mention any actual situation where real communities have confronted these issues. His argument stringently avoids any reference to concrete historical examples. Reynolds also exhibits the dismaying tendency of using simple declarative sentences like these: “The other is a presence who solicits my response by signaling a promise precisely in its distance. Its call is not anonymous, but signifies the trace of something that invites recognition and bids me to pay attention to it. I respond. My world is adjusted. I am transposed, tilted toward the exterior” (113). Where, when, and how are these things actually happening? Only in a vague, theoretical stratosphere? Or in real life? If the latter, why not dwell on a few specific examples? Jargon and underdefined catchphrases further obscure matters: “Thus, meaningful vitality is the constitutive affirmation of being‐with, an affirmation that reflects a presentiment of surplus value intrinsic to the we‐relation” (123).<br>

Listen to the way Affery begs Mrs. Clennam to let her take over my keep: “Only promise me, that, if it's the poor thing that's kept here, secretly, you'll let me take charge of her and be her nurse.” But, no, they all seem willing to agree, I've been “dead a score of years and more.” Not just that, for they say my dying coincided exactly with the moment “when Arthur went abroad.” Do they mean, does Boz mean, that in turning his back on his motherland—to join his father in the business out East—he as much as did me in? Or that without me here, even unknown to him, there was nothing left for the son on native ground? Even in their lies, they're never all wrong.<br>

Abstract: Habits of self‐restraint, critical self‐analysis, and the willingness to partake in public moral deliberation echo dispositions valorized in classical Greek moral philosophy; they call to mind the virtues of temperance, wisdom, and courage. Such virtues require us to put political power to critical and moral scrutiny. In these respects attention to virtue requires us to develop the prophetic promise of just‐war morality—its potential to generate social criticism and, when necessary, resistance to political power.<br>

Abstract: Here is why. Technological media may generally strive for and promise immediacy,
         66but cinema quickly became—and, at its most interesting, still remains—an object of gaps and absences. From the outset, cinema's remarkable psychological and cultural voltage has been built on delay and slippage. What I have dubbeddécalagelies at the heart of the medium and of each particular film, a gap between here and there as well as now and then.67This French term connotes discrepancy in space and deferral or jumps in time. At the most primary level, the film image leaps from present to past, for what is edited and shown was filmed at least days, weeks, or months earlier. This slight stutter in its articulation then repeats itself in the time and distance that separates filmmaker from spectator and spectators from each other when they see the same film on separate occasions. The gap in each of these relations constitutes cinema's difference from television and new media. Films display traces of what is past and inaccessible, whereas TV and certainly the internet are meant to feel and be present. We live with television as a continual part of our lives and our homes; sets are sold as furniture. Keeping up a twenty‐four‐hour chatter on scores of channels, TV is banal by definition. In contrast, wego outto the movies, leaving home to cross into a different realm. Every genuine cinematic experience involvesdécalage, time‐lag. After all, we are taken on a flight during and after which we are not quite ourselves.<br>

Article Title: Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer: Responsibility, Parergon, and Catachresis<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Through this notion of being‐for‐God, we can see more clearly how prayer functions in the above notebook entries. In 1810, Coleridge had argued that prayer mediated between conscience and action: this makes sense, as prayer attests and bears witness to one’s sense of responsibility to God. It is the act of recognizing the demand of conscience and answering it, even if the only human answer that is truly faithful and appropriate sometimes seems to be guilt itself, tangled in its very attitude toward the promise of grace: “Mercy! mercy!” (N6244, fol. 74v). In 1827, the terms in question are those of activity and passivity: how can the human will bend itself into accord with the divine will? The answer is that the “I” must wrestle with the narcissism of its own being in order to attest to its being‐for‐God. In prayer, the human subject can be both “agent” and “patient”—that is, one who acts freely as a self but through this very act recognizes and accepts the self as for another, even as a gift from that other. Hence, this is the heart of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer: being for and before God, “turning your thoughts into acts by connecting them by an act with the idea of the Redeemer God.” In prayer, a phenomenological intentionality directed solely toward our sense of responsibility—“a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155)—can at least help orientate our being before and for God. This is why Coleridge can assert that in prayer alone is the life or will united with the idea of God (e.g., N5228, N5383) and why it can be a way out of the gnarled condition of sin. If one at least acknowledges one’s being‐for‐God, even if only in contemplating one’s abandonment of it in all other acts and intentionalities, then the economy of Christian salvation can be initiated: “O for the
         powerto cry out for mercy from the inmost / That would be Redemption!” (N3353).<br>

Abstract: As for the promise of meeting the creator on judgment day, a repeating theme in Quranic war injunctions is the contrast between heaven and earthly life. Although this earth and human life are created good—indeed, Islam denies the doctrine of original sin—the prospects of judgment day and the reward of paradise frequently are held up as the end goal, creating an imbalance of sanctity.
            65This life has less of it, at least in the battle books where, for instance, believing in God and the last day and striving in the cause of God is held up over going on pilgrimage to the sacred mosque (9:19). “Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of God, wealth and soul, have a greater reward with God, and will be successful” (9:20).<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: More, of course, remains to be said about the character of the prophetic and promissory in this scene, the tableau of a table host giving to those who desert him in the moments before his betrayal and eventual execution. Much remains to be developed in conversation with Tillich’s work to continue the work of political reasoning in and with the prophetic, searching for other ways and rationale to take the form or locus of divine promise and the character of the interaction between God’s gift as participation in the divine being, the breath of the Spirit that gives life and the promise that renews all things—all important subjects to which Tillich and others contribute. Nevertheless, the concept of possibility and promised being that we have found can develop and expand a concept of the political that does not include what it excludes, indeed, does not embrace only the abandoned. By finding the sign of the promise, we have discovered that being otherwise than sovereign does not move beyond ordinary sovereignty. It does not seek to dispel the realm of political autonomy with an ecclesial life beyond the realm of nonecclesial humanity. Yet, it recognizes the embrace of the marginal and barbarian that ordinary sovereignty includes by excluding. Finally, owing to the indeterminate character of a promissory note, the pledge, it does not trump, overwhelm, or absorb the world. It rather opens and transforms it from within with its unlooked‐for gift of possibility.<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Lévinas maintains throughout his writings on Judaism the classical claim that Jerusalem will be “a light to the nations” (Isaiah 51:4). The way in which this sentiment leads to a politics of exemplarity is perhaps most at issue when we consider Lévinas's position on Israel. As is evident from a recently published exchange in the days following the announcement of Israel's independence, the idea of Judaism discussed between Lévinas and Blanchot was clearly at odds with the fact of a Jewish state.
         28Yet both maintained support of the state to the point that Blanchot broke with the extreme Left after May '68 as a result of its anti-Israeli rhetoric.29For both it is certainly clear that Israel's existence needed no more justification than the fact of the Holocaust. Yet the question remains of how to handle the tension between a deracinating conception of Judaism and a Jewish state. Lévinas argues that Israel offerstheprivileged opportunity to instantiate the moral teaching of Judaism, writing in the essay “The State of Israel and the Religion of Israel” that “the State of Israel will be religious because of the intelligence of its great books which it is not free to forget.”30This position provides the resources for critiquing Israel when it does not live up to its moral vision but just as easily bestows Israel with the status of being unconditionally exceptional by virtue of its potential. Ultimately for Lévinas, Israel represents the unique promise of prophetic politics. It consequently should be defended and protected even when its actions, if performed by another state, would warrant critique and sanction.31Blanchot has been interpreted as being less critical of Israel, in fact, but this is not a consequence of his unconditional support for the nation.32Rather, by separating out the exigency of “being Jewish” from the Jewish people, Blanchot maintains the principle that being Jewish calls into questioneverynation,everyclaim to allegiance. Consequently, Isra~<br>

Article Title: Still Life in a Narrative Age: Charlie Kaufman's<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: Charlie's film stops at solution six: it becomes a film about a writer attempting to produce a screenplay and in a sense succeeding (although he fails to tell the story of
         The Orchid Thief, he manages at least to tell his own story). For Charlie, one might say, all that counts is that there be a (workable) screenplay, regardless of its theme. Kaufman's film, by contrast, delivers on the original promise to make a movie that would bring us closer to flowers. And it does so precisely by taking the detour through approaches one to six, by trying each one on only to discard it, by giving us an overdose of what we believed we wanted. Kaufman cannot simply show us flowers, right from the get-go; he must relentlessly rid us of our desire for more, patiently overcome our temptation to extract morals, meticulously ridicule our demand for stories. The opening of the movie sets the terms of the question; the first part cures us of our desire for flower-based wisdom, for stories around flowers, and for the story of flowers; and the second part, with its cascade of action, cures us by surfeit of our desire for narrative more generally, killing it off, as it were, along with Donald. We are able for the first time to see, actually see, what would have escaped our (full) attention at the start of the film, namely, flowers.Adaptationis, in the end, not an answer to the question why there can't be a movie simply about flowers.30But it is not a mere side-stepping of the question either. It is, instead, a reaction to the question underneath the question, the question of why we are so obsessed with narrative in the first place. It is not a statement but anaction, a philosophical therapy.31Its value lies in what it does, and what it does is to make the essentially atemporal life of flowers available once again to human beings, via the only medium they still take seriously.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Faustus enters into the play with his antiallegorical habit of mind firmly in place. In his opening soliloquy, he not only ignores the scriptural promise of salvation but also never acknowledges that every profession he considers and abandons resounds as a figure for salvation. In his refusal to read allegorically, Faustus articulates but does not hear that the study of each art stands as a metonym for a larger spiritual quest to come to God; he makes visible but does not see the eschatological trajectory in which the ends of earthly things are themselves means to move the soul toward an invisible, deferred ending in heaven.
      26Thus Faustus begins with Aristotle, asking whether “to dispute well” is “logic's chiefest end” (1.1.8). When he concludes that it is, and that this “art” affords “no greater miracle” (1.1.9), he decides to abandon its study since he has already “attained the end” (1.1.10). This seems fair enough, since merely to dispute may well indeed seem a rather limited goal, yet in the very next line, as Faustus actually renounces the art, he bids “on kai me on, farewell” (1.1.12), and the significance of what he is abandoning changes.27Faustus is abandoning not just the form of disputation but the opportunity to study being and nonbeing, existence itself; yet Faustus seems to think he understands the mysteries of ontology since he has mastered the external form of the art that is the vehicle for its study. In the same manner, Faustus renounces the law with an almost Pauline critique, calling it a form of “external trash” (1.1.35), yet, from the perspective of faith, even the Justinian rule “if one and the same thing is bequeathed to two persons, one should have the thing itself, the other the value of the thing”—which Faustus dismisses as a case of “paltry legacies” (1.1.30)—may be seen as a vehicle with which to ruminate on the very problem of having a self split into body and soul, with one part, “the thing,” going to the earth after death and th~<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Badiou’s attempt to “extract a formal, wholly secularized conception of grace”
         
               from the Pauline texts and to exploit their political potential while disregarding Paul’s theological commitments stems, basically, from his rejection of transcendence as such. Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation aimed to redefine God’s transcendence understood in a sense of other-worldliness so that it could be found in immanence (“God is beyond even in the middle of our lives”187
            
               ), that is to say, in the “neighbor who is within reach in any given situation.”188
            
               The God of Bonhoeffer is, in a sense, an absent God, a God who in the midst of the world remains invisible and silent until Christians make God present and visible by their participation in Jesus’s being for others. While Bonhoeffer radically reinterprets the traditional Christian notion of transcendence, Badiou simply does away with it. In this regard, he represents “a shared new determination to grapple with the legacy of the death of God in a deeper way than ever before, re-making philosophy from the ground up as a thinking ‘without God.’”189
            
               When Badiou speaks of the “death of God,” what he means by “God” is not only the metaphysical God with whose death Nietzsche and Heidegger were concerned (the end of onto-theology) and whose death enables the return of a “more divine” God. In light of his ontology, all three meanings of the word “God” that he distinguishes, that is, the living God of religion, the conceptual God of metaphysics, and the God of the poets, become superfluous.190
            
               As a consequence, even a theological understanding of religion—as, for instance, “a personal communion between God and human beings”191
            
               —that could be accepted by Bonhoeffer cannot stand in the face of Badiou’s radical dismissal of transcendence. However, when we look at the reality~<br>

Author(s): Zeichner Pádraig<br>
Abstract: The numerous changes and improvements which have been wrought in teacher education courses in the last two decades have not, apparently, satisfied the critics. Ironically, the reverse seems to have occurred, as recent events on both sides of the Atlantic testify. This essay argues that the developments of the last two decades in educational research and teacher education, which have yielded a wealth of new ideas and procedures, have also yielded a confusing proliferation of educational ideologies. In short, it suggests that the ascendancy of a diffuse, unselfcritical, and often combative discourse within educational studies has effectively eclipsed the more important question which must first be tackled if educational studies are to have a coherent, robust focus. This question, which is pursued in the second section of the paper, asks: is the educational enterprise, properly conceived, a distinctive, autonomous or sui generis enterprise with purposes of its own which are universal, or is it essentially a subservient enterprise, a vehicle for one or other currently prevailing ideology (cultural, technological, political, religious, etc.)? In exploring this question the essay puts to work some enduring insights from contemporary European philosophy, arguing that education as a 'practical hermeneutic discipline' holds a singular promise. Some important consequences of this promise for educational studies and teacher education are then considered.<br>

Article Title: The Theory of International Politics? An Analysis of Neorealist Theory<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20011187<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Topper Keith<br>
Abstract: In recent years a number of writers have defended and attacked various features of structural, or neo-realist theories of international politics. Few, however, have quarrelled with one of the most foundational features of neorealist theory: its assumptions about the nature of science and scientific theories. In this essay I assess the views of science underlying much neorelist theory, especially as they are articulated in the work of Kenneth Waltz. I argue not only that neorealist theories rest on assumptions about science and theory that have been questioned by postpositivist philosophers and historians of science, but also that the failure to consider the work of these writers yields theories of international politics that are deficient in several respects: they are "weak" theories in the sense that they cannot illuminate crucial features of international politics, they presuppose and sustain a narrow view of power and power relations, they reify practices and relations in the international arena and they offer little promise of producing the sort of "Copernican Revolution" for which Waltz called (or, more modestly, even a minimally satisfactory theory of international politics). In light of these shortcomings, I sketch an alternative approach to the study of international affairs, one that has been termed "prototype studies." I contend that such an approach provides scholars with a rigorous way of studying international politics, without being a theoretical science.<br>

Article Title: Alvin W. Gouldner and the Tragic Vision in Sociology<br>
Publisher: Department of Sociology, University of Kansas<br>
Issue: i23250013<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Chriss James J.<br>
Abstract: Alvin Gouldner's life and work is considered within the framework of his own attempt to fashion a reflexive sociology during the second half of his career. In the first half, Gouldner was a functionalist and dutifully contributed insights and theoretical innovations to the paradigm, even while remaining critical of Talcott Parsons' own version of structural-functionalism. Later, by 1962, Gouldner broke from the dominant tradition to become an outspoken critique of establishment sociology, in the process becoming more sympathetic to competing theories, especially Marxism. Eventually, Marxism, too, was found to be inadequate because of its lack of reflexivity, and Gouldner became further alienated from both traditions of sociology. Concomitantly, Gouldner was battling on personal and professional fronts in his role of social critic. He became increasingly hostile toward others for their willing compliance with prevailing cultural prescriptions, which he believed were robbing human beings of their agency, vitality, and will to power. Lacking authentic knowledge of oneself, one could not hope to create social theories which benefited society and contributed to the liberation of the human spirit. Gouldner was a tragic hero, for although he came to an understanding of the limitations of human strivings in creating socially beneficial social theory, and fought valiantly to establish a program to fill this lacuna, he ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of these insights because of his own hubris (on the personal front) and the internal paradoxes of reflexive sociology (on the professional front).<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>

Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Leong Ching<br>
Abstract: Notwithstanding the growing use of interpretive analysis in public administration and policy research, its fullest potential for evaluating intractable public conflict has yet to be tapped. We develop a mode of narrative analysis, partly based upon Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, that shows promise for analyzing public disputes. We illustrate this with a case study in Los Angeles involving a contentious proposal to inject recycled wastewater into the city's water supply. The analysis reveals that, by representing opposing interests with a simplistic narrative, the water industry's response has been superfluous. The latter assumes that impasse simply results from the public's lack of information, the logical response being an information dissemination campaign. We employ a hermeneutic approach to reveal a set of persistent issues that project proponents have hitherto failed to address. By respecting the inherent plurivocity and intertextuality of narrative, hermeneutics provides new inroads into controversial public issues. We close the discussion with implications for practice.<br>

Abstract: This paper asks, why does the eponymous hero of Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim fail to obtain absolution despite two confessional attempts, and then seek his own death? By using narratological distinctions together with an analysis of the confessional structures of Jim's narratives, we find that his confessions fail for three reasons: he never fulfils his promise to Marlow to plot the 'fundamental why' of his jumping ship, his father's 'easy morality' condemns him even before he abandons the Patna, and Marlow fails to meet his role as confessor.<br>

Abstract: Cellini non fu nemmeno arrestato per questo omicidio poiché Paolo 111 voleva che lui
continuasse a lavorare su alcune medaglie che gli aveva commissionato. Così il papa
garantì a Cellini un immediato salvacondotto e gii promise che lo avrebbe perdonato
durante la festa della Madonna nell'agosto seguente. Un'indagine sul caso di omicidio
avviata in ottobre fu bloccata dal salvacondotto papale. Nel frattempo Cellini aveva fatto
"pace" con il fratello della vittima. Il perdono papale fu concesso, come promesso,
nell'agosto seguente. Era comune nell'epoca che le autorità religiose o civili
concedessero delle attenuanti per i delitti commessi. Tra la casistica in base alla quale
queste attenuanti venivano concesse esisteva anche il caso di un delitto commesso da
persone di rara ed eccellente abilità, la cui morte poteva rappresentare un pericolo per il
benessere del regno. Ricavo queste informazioni dal documentato articolo di Paolo L.
Rossi citato in bibliografia, soprattutto le pagine 166 e seguenti.<br>

Abstract: La Modernidad parecía condenar a la expulsión de la religión respecto del proyecto ilustrado al considerar que fe y razón eran excluyentes. No obstante, esa promesa de futuro de emancipación y de racionalidad ilustrada ha incurrido en sus propios aspectos negativos, hasta llegar, en la postmodernidad, a la deconstrucción de todo y la pérdida de sentido. El filósofo Habermas y el teólogo Ratzinger, después Papa Benedicto XVI, debatieron el papel que razón y fe debían desempeñar en las actuales sociedades plurales. Ambos partían de premisas distintas –Habermas desde la confianza en la Ilustración y en la religión como humanismo y Ratzinger desde el necesario entendimiento entre fe y razón– para llegar a un punto de encuentro: la necesidad de defender una nueva Ilustración, compatible con la religión, para operar en la postmodernidad. Modernity seemed to replace religion with the Enlightenment project, since it considered that reason and faith were mutually exclusive. However, the promise of a future of emancipation and Enlightenment reason has finally culminated, in Postmodernity, in the destruction of everything and the loss of meaning. Habermas, philosopher, and Ratzinger, theologian and later Pope Benedict XVI, discussed the role that ought to be played by reason and faith in the current plural societies. They were based on different premises—Habermas on trust in the Enlightenment and in religion from a humanistic perspective and Ratzinger on the necessary understanding between faith and reason—and reached a common point: the need to defend a new Enlightenment, compatible with religion, which can operate in Postmodernity.<br>

lutionary hope but out of the experience of partial or total disenchantment with the revolution-
ary promise. The striking fact is that a number of these works nonetheless retain, but translate
into a different dimension of experience, the design, the ideas, and the imagery of the callower
works their authors had composed in a mood of millennial excitement" {Natural Supernaturalism,
p. 335).<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25619787<br>
Date: 8 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that Freud's theory pictures modern selves as coping with a new existential and social predicament: a sense of homelessness within their own home. More specifically, Freud suggests that individuals feel estranged from parts of their own psyche (their super-egos) as well as feeling distant from their own culture and tradition (as they are represented by this psychic agency); in modernity, neither one's mind nor one's community can promise any longer a sense of ground. Because of this sense of perpetual and irrevocable displacement, Freud feared that modern selves might become semi-psychotic, selves lacking an inner social-normative voice. He calls on moderns, however, to overcome this bleak prospect and the related danger of political chaos by accepting the social norms imposed by their super-egos. But Freud champions only a conditional acceptance of tradition, one that involves ongoing scepticism, ambivalence and emotional distance. Freud's position could therefore be characterized as a unique type of communitarianism: it seeks a balance between admission of the constitutive force of tradition on the one hand, and the formation of an emotional detachment from its myths, practices and normative claims on the other.<br>

Author(s): Honig Bonnie<br>
Abstract: Deliberative democratic theorists (in this essay, Seyla Benhabib and Jurgen Habermas) seek to resolve, manage, or transcend paradoxes of democratic legitimation or constitutional democracy. Other democratic theorists, such as Chantal Mouffe, embrace such paradoxes and affirm their irreducibility. Deliberativists call that position "decisionism." This essay examines the promise and limits of these various efforts by way of a third paradox: Rousseau's paradox of politics, whose many workings are traced through Book II, Chapter 7 of the Social Contract. This last paradox cannot be resolved, transcended, managed, or even affirmed as an irreducible binary conflict. The paradox of politics names not a clash between two logics or norms but a vicious circle of chicken-and-egg (which comes first—good people or good law?). It has the happy effect of reorienting democratic theory: toward the material conditions of political practice, the unavoidable will of the people who are also always a multitude, and the not only regulative but also productive powers of law.<br>

Abstract: En janvier 1972, dans la France de Georges Pompidou, aux derniers feux de la "nouvelle société" promise depuis Matignon par Jacques Chaban-Delmas, "casseurs" et "gauchistes" sont déjà hors-jeu. Mais le "front des luttes" post-68 se déplace. Les prisonniers entrent en scène, à Toul en décembre 1971 puis à Nancy, ouvrant une mise en accusation de la justice dont le témoignage du docteur Vasseur en 2000 a bien montré que l'instruction n'était pas achevée. Les historiens entreprennent aujourd'hui, sur archives et témoignages, l'exploration de ce lancinant procès. Voici un des premiers exemples de leur travail, au ras des faits et des interprétations d'époque. Dans le sillage des luttes de l'après-68, des prisonniers de droit commun se mobilisèrent à partir de 1971. La mutinerie de Nancy en janvier 1972 fut réprimée mais suscita une mobilisation à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur des prisons françaises. L'auteur l'analyse notamment à partir des archives du Groupe d'information sur les prisons (GIP), mais aussi de la presse et de diverses enquêtes. Le GIP, où militaient aussi des intellectuels de renom, prit ainsi une part importante dans la mise à jour de la réalité carcérale, à l'occasion de ce qui fut le premier grand procès de la prison. /// In the wake of the post-1968 struggles, common law prisoners started mobilizing as of 1971. The Nancy mutiny in January 1972 was repressed, but it brought about mobilization inside and outside French prisons. The author analyzes this from the records of the Prison Information Group (GIP) but also from those of the press and various investigations. The GIP, in which famous intellectuals actively participated, had a big role in showing prison reality clearly in what was the first big prison trial.<br>

Abstract: How did men seduce in seventeenth-century Spanish society? To answer that question this article interweaves the classic seventeenth-century tale "The Playboy [Deceiver] of Seville" with the love letters written by Spanish men subsequently identified as seducers in breach of promise suits in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Mexico. It defines seduction's central psychological dynamic as men's open declarations of emotional vulnerability to women. By acknowledging their subservience to and dependence upon women from the very outset, men reversed the classic gender hierarchy of Spanish society. This reversal also openly expressed itself in men's inversion of racial, social, generational categories for themselves. The cultural construct of seduction in Spanish society is also shown to be more complex than it appears on the surface, and more susceptible to manipulation by both men and women.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the relations of faith, love, and hope suggests a unique approach to theological ethics, one that holds fresh promise for bringing together considerations of the good (teleology) and the right (deontology) around the notion of an "economy of the gift." The economy of the gift articulates Ricoeur's distinctively dialectical understanding of the relation of the human and the divine, and the resulting dialectical moral relation of the self and the other. Despite our fallen condition, Ricoeur suggests, we are called by the divine to embrace the radical possibility of the reconciliation of human goods under the requirement of accountability to human diversity and otherness.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: Developing effective spatial structures for mitigating the negative effects of the expansion of metropolitan areas continues to be problematic. Metropolitan growth has exacerbated urban sprawl, fragmentation of landscapes, environmental degradation, dislocation of viable neighborhoods, social and economic inequities, and homogeneity of regional cultural values. These negative effects of metropolitan growth continue to intensify, despite an impressive array of urban spatial forms and structures that have been proposed to mitigate them such as new urbanism, smart growth, and sustainable development. This paper proposes sustainable regionalism as a way to manage metropolitan growth. Sustainable regionalism seeks to create, revitalize, and restore the ecological region in metropolitan areas through the physical design and planning of neighborhoods, villages, and cities within a region from a regionally-based sustainable perspective. It fuses specific ideas from the Geddes-MacKaye-Mumford-McHarg concept of natural regionalism, Kenneth Frampton's notion of critical regionalism, and the sustainable development paradigm, adapted to contemporary social, cultural, political, and environmental forces shaping the metropolitan landscape. What sustainable regionalism is, how it evolved, its key features, and promise for managing metropolitan landscapes, comprise the subjects of this paper.<br>

Abstract: One of the acute problems of the early church was the tension between the absolute promise of Jesus and the fact that worthy prayers were not answered. Two types of solution developed. The more popular, drawing on Jewish precedent in the Old Testament, took the easy option, and blamed the petitioner for various forms of inadequacy. The other recognized the incarnational character of grace, and thus saw Christians as the hands and ears of God. When they listened to the needs of others and responded God heard and acted. Un des problèmes brûlants qui préoccupaient l'Église primitive était l'extrême tension entre la promesse absolue de Jésus et le fait que des prières apparemment dignes d'être exaucées restaient sans réponse. Deux types de solution se développèrent. L'explication la plus populaire, qui s'inspirait d'un précédent juif attesté dans l'Ancien Testament, choisit la solution facile : c'est l'orant qu'il fallait blâmer : sa prière avait été insuffisante. L'autre solution reconnaissait le caractère incarné de la grâce : les chrétiens étaient les mains et les oreilles de Dieu. Quand ils étaient attentifs aux besoins des autres et y répondaient, Dieu les écoutait et agissait.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette leçon inaugurale, l'auteur se penche sur l'Évangile, compris au sens large de «promesse», comme objet et comme source de subversion. Deux textes bibliques illustrent chacun de ces deux aspects : le livre de Job et la parabole matthéenne des ouvriers de la onzième heure (Mt 20, 1-16). Une troisième et dernière partie porte sur la relation entre révélation et mystère. Le style oral a été en partie conservé. In this inaugural lecture, delivered on September 24, 2012 at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Geneva, the author develops the theme of the Gospel — understood broadly as «promise» — as both the object and subject of subversion. Two biblical texts are taken as illustrations of these two aspects: the book of Job and Matthew's parable of the vineyard workers of the eleventh hour (Mt 20:1-16). A third and final part focuses on the relation between revelation and mystery. The original style of the lecture has been partly maintained.<br>

Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Article Title: Metaphor and Imagination in James Wilson's Theory of Federal Union<br>

Abstract: American federalism is nothing more-and nothing less-than a metaphor. This was how James Wilson, the most prominent lawyer at the Philadelphia Convention, came to approach the novel problem of understanding and conveying what federalism in a modern republic should mean. The Federal Republic created in 1787 was, for Wilson, more than a matter of ingenious political design, more than a matter of the "new science of politics," and more than a matter of constitutional law or constitutionalism itself-unless the Constitution were seen to "comprehend" the moral purpose and moral promise of the new nation. To Wilson, this view of the importance of the moral content of republican federalism was entailed by the "knowledge" that he took to be the necessary foundation of the Republic. It was this knowledge of certain fundamental principles-of "moral science," human nature, and the nature of language, and, more generally, of "cultivation" as a political and social process that was also an end in itself-that ultimately justified "the People" as the "sublime" metaphor governing American constitutional theory. Yet, for all Wilson's faith in figurative "comprehensiveness," his distinctive approach to securing the New Republic through a federal union of the American People seems to have proved less and less compelling to his contemporaries the more he tried to pursue it as far as his vision of a politics of cultivation directed.<br>

Abstract: In the history of moral philosophy culminating in our moment of hyperbolic ethics, our plight has become less familiar and more uncanny, as the notion of duty or obligation increasingly takes on the sense of risk and urgency involved in substituting myself for another in a way that entails danger, even hostage, which, by the way, also has its roots in a Latin word for pledge—
      pledgein the sense of giving oneself over for the other and also in the sense of making a promise or a binding oath, in other words, a speech act, the very possibility of which assumes both other people and the Other of language and culture. Kant's autonomous will gives way to the vulnerability of the face for Levinas or suffering as the uncanny “capacity” for vulnerability for Derrida. The “I can” of moral agency becomes passively subjected to the other upon whom it depends ontologically and biologically for its very existence. Levinas proposes a responsibility that I cannot refuse because there is no I without it. Insofar as I am, I am answerable and responsible to and for the other. Contra Hegel and Sartre, Levinas (1998) maintains that subjectivity is not the in-itself become for-itself but, rather, the in-itself become for-the other. Yet Levinas insists that this hyperethical responsibility operates on a level opposed to the political. Justice, he says, requires a third, whereas the force of our ethical obligation finds its imperative in the face-to-face relation, which cannot be translated into the political realm.<br>

Abstract: Kierkegaard's Silentio focuses attention on the last of God's commands to Abraham, the command to sacrifice Isaac. But he also calls our attention to a couple of the promises that constitute the covenantal relation, the promise of a land and the promise that through his seed all people will be blessed.

Abstract: Meanwhile another word underpins and undermines the
         finis/phoenix/phonicsuite of phonemes: that word, inevitably, isphoney. The possibility of a positive, direct, and lucid relationship between signifier and signified is counterfeit: Joyce herein reveals his own “phoney habit … in his clairaudience.”
               The promise of phonic redemption proves false and even risible, not only125
            phoneybut ineluctablyfunny, in Joyce's “tellafun book.”
