  CHAPTER 5  Trauma and the Theban Cycle from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt4qt">Intimate Domain</a><br>
  Abstract: How can intimacy become a subject for critical reflection?¹ Intimacy is typically understood to focus on emotions of love and supportive family bonds. But if family life is the beginning point for reflection on intimacy, it is not the only terrain we can explore in an effort to understand it. Helpfully, Julia Kristeva both broadens and narrows the field for critical reflection on intimacy. She broadens it when she links intimacy to art, religion, and psychoanalysis and cites the unique capacity of these forms of cultural expression to
                  protect the singularity of human life.² Kristeva narrows the context for critical<br>

  Abstract: The surprising popularity of psychoanalysis has made the fortunes of certain key-words: image, symbol and symbolism have now become current coin. At the same time, systematic research devoted to the mechanisms of “primitive mentality” has revealed the importance of symbolism in archaic thinking and also the fundamental part it plays in the life of any and every primitive society.

  2  The Experiential Basis of Subjectivity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnpkw">Subjectivity</a><br>
  Author(s) FITZ-HENRY ERIN<br>
  Abstract: For years, the study of subjectivity has been dominated by theories of the self that interrogate cultural representations and performance. These studies have a certain richness in helping us understand how societies change because they are able to deal with collective transformations through major cultural meanings and practices. But they usually leave the intimate subjectivity of individuals unanalyzed, like a black box, or bring to it a decidedly sectarian view, such as Freudian psychoanalysis, which has long been overworked and overreached as an explanatory framework. However, anthropology has downplayed, at least since W. H. R. Rivers, the importance of theories<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x03fr">Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory</a><br>
  Abstract: In this book I conduct an investigation of important religious, theological, and psychoanalytic concepts, primarily through a reading of sublimation. Sublimation is a privileged term that is closely connected with the notion of the sublime, a Kantian term that also has psychoanalytic and theological connotations. Investigating sublimation and the sublime as important terms for theological discourse brings together psychoanalytic theory from Freud to Lacan, Kristeva, and Žižek along with more conventional philosophical discourses, including contemporary continental philosophy. To orient ourselves toward considering the significance of psychoanalysis for thinking about religious and theological topics, I will begin with a concrete example<br>

  Abstract: According to Lacan, Freud described the reception of psychoanalysis in the United States by stating, “they don’t realize we’re bringing them the plague.”¹ This statement refers to the simple-minded embrace of Freudian psychoanalysis by many of its American adherents (which Lacan attacked), although Freud knew full well that many opponents of psychoanalysis did treat it like a destructive plague. This description of the reception of psychoanalysis could also refer to the contemporary American reception of postmodernism. On the one hand, many scholars dismiss recent French philosophy as irrational, nihilistic, or irresponsible—that is, as a plague—whereas many proponents of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x03hs">Saintly Influence: Edith Wyschogrod and the Possibilities of Philosophy of Religion</a><br>
  Author(s) HOLLYWOOD AMY<br>
  Abstract: In 1977, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem inaugurated a Sigmund Freud Professorship. They invited Freud’s daughter Anna Freud to speak. Unable to attend, Anna Freud sent a paper, described by Yosef Yerushalmi in
                  Freud’s Moses: Judaism Terminable and Interminable, as “a sober and clear review of the possible future directions of psychoanalysis and its potential place within a university setting.”² Yerushalmi notes his approval: “In all, it was an eminently suitable paper for an academic event.” What really interests Yerushalmi, however, is not this eminently suitable and restrained academic paper, but the “abrupt and unexpected ending, in total discontinuity with<br>

  Author(s) KELBER WERNER H.<br>
  Abstract: Three interrelated features may be said to characterize the work of Edith Wyschogrod. There is first an interdisciplinary drive to rise above institutionally sanctioned boundaries and to retrieve intellectual categories from their disciplinary captivity so as to reconfigure them in novel contexts. It is this desire and the ability to bring widely differing genres, discourses and traditionally separate intellectual orbits into productive coalitions that have increasingly distinguished her writings. This linking of philosophy and theology, psychoanalysis and science, literary criticism and linguistics, architecture and the arts, media studies and above all, ethics, is carried off with a high degree of<br>

  CHAPTER 10  The Question Concerning Nature from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x04rw">Interpreting Nature: The Emerging Field of Environmental Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Author(s) McGrath Sean<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I situate Timothy Morton’s and Slavoj Žižek’s “ecology without nature” (hereafter EWN) within the broader history of transcendental-structuralist ontology.¹ I will argue that, notwithstanding Morton’s recent turn to object-oriented ontology, his deconstruction of a certain notion of nature, which we provisionally describe as the extra-lingual intelligible order, does not deviate from the a-cosmic trajectory of late modern thinking, from nineteenth-century transcendental philosophy, through hermeneutics and semiotics to Lacanian psychoanalysis.

  FOUR  Rearview Mirror: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x09nr">Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment</a><br>
  Abstract: If we interpret deconstruction as a form of translation as transference, we have moved into the territory of psychoanalysis. Indeed, if poetic majesty acts to unseat sovereign majesty through the cut that carries with it rebirth, as in the story of Little Red Riding Hood, then psychoanalysis may be the discourse best equipped for articulating the dynamics of this wound that is also a source of life. In other words, psychoanalysis may provide the tools with which to analyze the thorny relationship between violence and life, particularly through the concepts of death drive and sublimation. Returning to our violent girls,<br>

  Abstract: In the penultimate chapter of
                  Strangers to Ourselves(1989), Julia Kristeva distills the “political and ethical impact of the Freudian breakthrough.”¹ Surfacing at the close of an invigorating cultural (and classically Kristevan) romp through political, literary, and philosophical history, carrying us from dawning awareness of sexual difference (“the first foreigners: women”) to Jewish, Greek, and Roman representations of autochthony and otherness, and finally to Enlightenment thinking on universalism, her remarks on the uncanny in Freud signal our entry into a domain decisively shaped by Kristeva herself: that of politics and psychoanalysis. “The ethics of psychoanalysis implies a cosmopolitanism … of<br>

  Abstract: When Gadamer wrote the last part of
                  Truth and Method,language had not yet reached the leading role on the philosophical stage that it would later come to have. The “linguistic turn” of the twentieth century, the point at which the most varied of philosophical currents run together, had not yet occurred. These currents go from logical positivism to Wittgenstein, from american pragmatism to structuralism and psychoanalysis, from heidegger to the transcendental pragmatism of apel and habermas, from merleau-Ponty to derrida’s deconstruction. Philosophical hermeneutics contributes as well. But at that time even Gadamer could not imagine that his “turn”—the<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Myth and Narrative in Contemporary Opera-Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dun Tan<br>
  Abstract: Yayoi Uno Everett focuses on four operas that helped shape the careers of the composers Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun, which represent a unique encounter of music and production through what Everett calls "multimodal narrative." Aspects of production design, the mechanics of stagecraft, and their interaction with music and sung texts contribute significantly to the semiotics of operatic storytelling. Everett's study draws on Northrop Frye's theories of myth, Lacanian psychoanalysis via Slavoj Žižek, Linda and Michael Hutcheon's notion of production, and musical semiotics found in Robert Hatten's concept of troping in order to provide original interpretive models for conceptualizing new operatic narratives.<br>

  Book Title: Medium, Messenger, Transmission-An Approach to Media Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krämer Sybille<br>
  Abstract: Medium, Messenger, Transmissionuses the figure of the messenger as a key metaphor for the function of all transmission media. Sybille Krämer illustrates this argument with a diverse range of situations involving some form of transmission, including the circulation of money, the translation of languages, the spread of infectious diseases, processes of transference and countertransference as seen in psychoanalysis, and even the development of cartography. This rich study provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of media philosophy while illuminating transmission media as active mediators in all systems of exchange.<br>

  13  The Critique of Religion and Post-Metaphysical Faith: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgg3z">Engaging Bonhoeffer</a><br>
  Author(s) Gregor Brian<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur was one of the leading French philosophers of the twentieth centuries. He was also one of the most erudite. From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  3  Toward a Theological Engagement of Early Childhood from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t6sv">Horror and Its Aftermath</a><br>
  Abstract: Both theology and psychoanalysis draw upon narrative in their common search for greater understanding of human weakness and the possibility of human wholeness. In theology, such narratives range from biblical to confessional literature, as well in the twentieth century to the positing of narrative theology either in place of or as complement to systematic theology.¹ Theology has as its chief end greater understanding of the divine and of the relationship of the divine to creation, in particular to humankind. That project has led theologians to consider human nature and behavior at great length, often with impassioned interest, although not always<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Chapter V  An impulse toward lawlessness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b9x1k5">Grand Hotel Abyss</a><br>
  Abstract: Thus far, our main concern has been to adequately develop notions of subject and of individuality on the basis of articulations between psychoanalysis and Hegelian philosophy. These articulations have been silently guided by a strategy which consisted in adopting as our own critical perspectives aimed at the work of both authors; this procedure in turn allowed us to ultimately conclude that the commentators in question, while to some extent right, had been right for the wrong reasons.<br>

  Abstract: ‘Identity’ has been among the most central concepts in 20
                  thcentury psychology and sociology. It acquired its significance, which has persisted in all essentials until today, particularly in the context of pragmatist, interactionist and psychoanalytical thought,—even if the term played no role in the work of either Sigmund Freud or William James, but rather only in subsequent attempts to develop their theories of the subject and the self (Straub, 1991, 1994). Of course the remarkable career of ‘identity’ is due especially to certain works that were still close to the sources of psychoanalysis and pragmatism, even if they were<br>

  Author(s) Kennedy Roger<br>
  Abstract: From its early days the place and function of memory has been central to the theory and technique of psychoanalysis, though the picture of how memory functions from a psychoanalytic point of view has undergone many transformations. From memories that arose from the hypnotic treatment of adults, Freud began with the notion that hysteria was caused by the sexual molestation of children. As is well known, Freud later felt that in this early work on hysteria, he had overvalued reality and undervalued fantasy.¹ In his later work, the main emphasis passed away from actual sexual abuse as a cause of<br>

  Book Title: Freud's Moses-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: In
      Freud's
            Mosesa distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

  Abstract: Thanks to Wallace Stevens, our focus in the last chapter on the “irrational element” in poetry by means of its speculative relationship to Freudian and post-Freudian psychoanalysis from the 1950s and onward perhaps requires us to explore further Stevens’s own specific debt to the psychoanalytic enterprise itself. I therefore designate psychoanalysis as an “other,” and here a terminal context among others in this study, all the while exercising some caution, as in the last chapter when the subject was broached in relation to Schuyler by means of (and with respect to) Deleuze. This hesitation in Stevens’s case arises because commentators<br>

  Abstract: Satan is part of the myth of evil and if we assume that the story is one way to approach the reality of evil, we need to examine the myth in more detail. From a secular viewpoint, any metaphysical approach to the question of evil does not work. The responsibilities for all human actions lay, since Kant, in the agent’s will and accordingly, so does the decision to commit an evil deed. Nevertheless, despite all efforts to explain human behavior with psychology, sociology, biology, and psychoanalysis, there seems to be an explanatory gap when it comes to actions that hurt<br>

  Author(s) Briscoe-Dimock Shelley<br>
  Abstract: The concept of “alliance” is rooted in psychoanalysis and Freud, who viewed the alliance as the connection between client and therapist (Horvath, 2001). Although there is no precise definition of alliance, the concept has been a topic of theoretical and empirical interest for the past quarter-century, particularly in counselling and supervision.<br>

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

  Book Title: Psychoanalytic Mediations between Marxist and Postcolonial Readings of the Bible-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Runions Erin<br>
  Abstract: This volume pursues critical readings of the Bible that put psychoanalysis into conversation with Marxist and postcolonial criticism. In these essays psychoanalysis provides a way to mediate between Marxism's materialist groundings and postcolonialism's resistance against empire. The essays in the volume illuminate the way empire has shaped the biblical text by looking at the biblical texts' silences, ruptures, oversights, over-emphases, and inexplicable elements. These details are read as symptoms of a set of oppressive material relations that shaped and continue to haunt the text in the ascendancy of the text in the name of the West.<br>

  Author(s) Boer Roland<br>
  Abstract: My argument is that the current spate of “anti-imperial” studies of the Bible manifests a fetishism of empire. I understand fetish here in two senses, one in line with Freudian psychoanalysis, in which the fetish marks both the disavowal of castration and the affirmation that the penis is still there, albeit displaced onto another object, the other following a marxist trajectory in which the fetish becomes an element of the socioeconomic context, indicating a transfer of powers between human beings and object fetishized. however, unlike a trend—which really began with Theodor adorno and the Frankfurt school and runs through<br>

  Author(s) Liew Tat-siong Benny<br>
  Abstract: Jacques Lacan (2001, 341) has famously declared that “it is not enough to decide on the basis of its effect—Death. it still remains to be decided which death, that which is brought by life or that which brings life.” Of course, for Lacan, whose psychoanalysis has much to do with one’s relations to death and the dead (Luepnitz 2003, 232), there is a difference between biological and psychic death and hence between mortality and vitality. Nevertheless, his statement does highlight, in a delightfully ironic way, how talk about death can—or should—be both specific and ambiguous at the<br>

  Book Title: The Muses on Their Lunch Hour-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garber Marjorie<br>
  Abstract: As a break from their ordained labors, what might the Muses today do on their lunch hour? This collection of witty, shrewd, and imaginative essays addresses interdisciplinary topics that range widely from Shakespeare, to psychoanalysis, to the practice of higher education today. With the ease born of deep knowledge, Marjorie Garber moves from comical journalistic quirks (GÇ£Fig LeavesGÇ¥) to the curious return of myth and ritual in the theories of evolutionary psychologists (GÇ£Ovid, Now and ThenGÇ¥)._x000D_ Two themes emerge consistently in GarberGÇÖs latest exploration of symptoms of culture. The first is that to predict the GÇ£next big thingGÇ¥ in literary studies we should look back at ideas and practices set aside by a previous generation of critics. In the past several decades we have seen the reemergence ofGÇöfor exampleGÇötextual editing, biography, character criticism, aesthetics, and philology as GÇ£hotGÇ¥ new areas for critical intervention. The second theme expands on this observation, making the case for GÇ£cultural forgettingGÇ¥ as the way the arts and humanities renew themselves, both within fields and across them.

  CHAPTER 6  Identity Theft from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6bb4">The Muses on Their Lunch Hour</a><br>
  Abstract: How might the teaching of psychoanalysis and, in particular, the teaching of psychoanalytic interpretations of Shakespeare be made more visible and effective in American colleges and universities? On this point it is tempting simply to paraphrase Lacan and say that there is no academic relation. A nominal adjective like “Freudian” can—and does—cover a multitude of (largely inaccurate) sins, but “Kleinian” and “Kohutian” are not part of the undergraduate vocabulary, nor, so far as I can tell, are names like Winnicott, Bion, Bowlby, or Kernberg.<br>

This collection therefore discriminates between what one could call a critical but frame-abiding and a more radical frame-transcending or frame-shattering handling of the structuralist paradigm. Postclassical Narratology: Approaches and Analyses discusses a large variety of different aspects of narrative, such as extensions of classical narratology, new generic applications (autobiography, oral narratives, poetry, painting, and film), the history of narratology, the issue of fictionality, the role of cognition, and questions of authorship and authority, as well as thematic matters related to ethics, gender, and queering. Additionally, it uses a wide spectrum of critical approaches, including feminism, psychoanalysis, media studies, the rhetorical theory of narrative, unnatural narratology, and cognitive studies. In this manner the essays manage to produce new insights into many key issues in narratology.<br>

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq728">Whose Freud?</a><br>
  Abstract: Our first topic is marked by an immediate and noticeable split. Does the title refer to discontents generated
                  withinpsychoanalysis or discontent with the psychoanalytic enterprise itself? The section begins oddly—with Frederick Crews’s proleptic rebuttal of the arguments he assumes will follow. Alone among the essayists Crews wants to consider notwhatplace psychoanalysis has in contemporary culture butwhetherit should even have a place. Because his perspective leads him to reject the premises of the volume, he shrewdly uses the essays themselves as examples of the circular reasoning and methodological flaws he considers inherent to psychoanalysis.

  Author(s) Crews Frederick<br>
  Abstract: When I was invited to participate in the symposium whose proceedings are recalled in this book, I accepted with alacrity. Here, I thought, lay the makings of a lively and fruitful debate not merely about
                  whatrole psychoanalysis plays in “contemporary culture” but also aboutwhether it deservesto play such a role. If, as I believe, Freudian ideas tell us nothing that is empirically warrantable about the mind but much about the pitfalls of question-begging discourse, then presumably the application of those same ideas to cultural problems will itself run the risk of overconfidence and even circularity.

  Abstract: I would like to address two issues that have not only caused some discontent for psychoanalysis, but that seem to emerge internal to psychoanalysis as its own proper sphere of discontent: incest and normative kinship. They are related, most prominently through the incest taboo: what it forecloses on one hand, what it inaugurates and legitimates on the other. I would like to make two separate remarks about incest and kinship. The first concerns contemporary debates on incest and how, and whether, incest can be conceptualized; the second concerns the relation between the prohibition against incest and the institution of normative<br>

  Abstract: The four essayists here come from and work between many disciplines, bridging psychoanalysis with literary interpretation, art criticism, history, and feminist theory. The eclecticism of the group stems from the eclectic texture of Freud’s writing: while always maintaining a base in medical science and therapeutic technique, Freud’s work comes to include an array of essays in interpretation and several monumental theories of history and culture. This part of the volume investigates the relation between the techniques of psychoanalysis as a medical therapy and the application of psychoanalysis as a mode of cultural interpretation, considering questions raised by the unique way<br>

  Abstract: This volume invites us to consider the place of psychoanalysis in contemporary culture. In modern feminism debates pitting cultural against biological causation have played an important role. Such debates have also arisen in relation to research in biotechnology, neurobiology, sociobiology, and ethnomethodology. I think it could be shown that Freud thinks of the body in terms that undermine the opposition between natural causation and cultural meanings that have been with us since Kant first distinguished between the realms of necessity and freedom. If this is right, then Freud does have a philosophically original contribution to make to contemporary debates about<br>

  Abstract: What is the place of a psychoanalysis that exists “between” therapy (considered both as a theory and a practice, but also as a theory
                  ofpractice) and hermeneutics, or the theory of interpretation and understanding? How do we understand “understanding” itself, considered as a mental process involving both analyst and analysand? I want to approach these questions by way of the writing of the British post-Kleinian psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion (1897–1979) . Bion is best known outside psychoanalytic circles as a proponent of the leaderless group and as a theorist of group process.¹ But his collected theoretical and clinical oeuvre<br>

  Abstract: This section considers the role of psychoanalysis in posing the question of sexual identity: a question crucial to psychoanalysis, but also one in which Freud’s own views have been most open to attack. Paul Robinson, an intellectual historian, begins by showing how an ambivalent or vacillating perspective toward homosexuality—within Freud’s own work—generates various perspectives on sexual desire and social norms in twentieth-century psychoanalytic thought. On one hand, as Robinson claims, “no one has done more to destabilize the notion of heterosexuality than Freud.” For Freud, the “homosexual object choice” is present in
                  allindividuals’ psychic development; it is<br>

  Abstract: What exactly is psychoanalytic thought, and how might answering this question help us to define what might be called the psychoanalytically constituted subject? One of the most curious aspects of
                  Civilization and Its Discontentsis Freud’s reiterated self-reproach to the effect that he is not speaking psychoanalytically. The work was written in 1929, late in Freud’s career, so it’s not as if he hadn’t had time to develop a distinctively psychoanalytic language. You would think that by now Freud would be “speaking psychoanalysis” fluently. But the complaints start in Chapter 3, where he laments that “so far we have discovered<br>

  Introduction from:

  Abstract: Near the beginning of his essay Robert Jay Lifton argues: “Without psychoanalysis, we don’t have a psychology worthy of address to history and society or culture. But at the same time, if we employ psychoanalysis in its most pristine state, its most traditional form, we run the risk of eliminating history in the name of studying it.” The eclectic essays in this part all point to both the “worth” and the “risk” of a psychoanalytically inflected historiography. Such an enterprise can move toward one of two extremes. On one hand, “psychohistory” has sometimes devolved into the simplified analysis of historically<br>

  Abstract: In this essay I wish to discuss my work not as applied psychoanalysis—that term still has some of the aura of early psychoanalytic imperialism, Freud’s talk about “conquering” various spheres of thought—but rather in connection with psychoanalysis as its source. My work in psychohistorical areas begins with psychoanalytic influence, and never loses that influence, but it does evolve in its own way in certain additional directions. There is a real paradox here, important to keep in mind particularly in historical and cultural studies: without psychoanalysis, we don’t have a psychology worthy of address to history and society or<br>

  Abstract: What relations are there between Freud’s theories of the mind and modern functional brain imaging experiments? To anchor this question, we present two statements from Mark Solms’s recent article about the nature of consciousness.¹ First, Solms emphasized Freud’s definition that “mental processes are in themselves unconscious,” arguing the relevance of this definition to modern controversies about brainmind-consciousness. We are willing to accept a moderate form of this position, in which the unconscious is acknowledged to contribute significantly to mental processes. The second quotation is less familiar: “psychoanalysis and PET scanning study one and the same underlying object: the mental apparatus<br>

  Abstract: Panel Six places philosophical models of truthfulness face to face with the psychoanalytic session. Whereas psychoanalytic theory relies on a horizon of truthfulness, psychoanalytic praxis revolves around an alert attention to the probable fictiveness of the analysand’s truth (intentional statements, recovered memories) and the probable truthfulness of his or her fictions (performative acting-out, symbolic transferences). As a comment in the discussion section puts it: “the manifest, apparent story or truth sometimes is only a communication about a hidden more interesting truth”; or as John Forrester more dramatically claims, in psychoanalysis “a ‘no’ may mean ‘yes’, and a ‘yes’ almost certainly<br>

  Abstract: I attribute the strange title of this section to the historical fact that people who have become pessimistic about how to connect psychoanalysis with truth, or how to confirm or disconfirm psychoanalytic propositions, whether of a theoretical or an applied kind, have nevertheless continued to hold psychoanalysis in high esteem, and they have thought to resolve the issue by inventing a new value, or virtue, which they still call “truth,” but then append to it a qualifier, like “metaphoric,” or “narrative.” Thus they take away with one hand what they bestow with the other.<br>

  Truth in Psychoanalysis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq728">Whose Freud?</a><br>
  Author(s) Lear Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: Roughly speaking, there are two ways to approach the concept of truth in psychoanalysis, “from the outside” and “from the inside.” In working “from the outside,” we bring a conception of truth, developed, say, in philosophy, to psychoanalysis as an object of study.

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

  Abstract: Our first topic is marked by an immediate and noticeable split. Does the title refer to discontents generated
                  withinpsychoanalysis or discontent with the psychoanalytic enterprise itself? The section begins oddly—with Frederick Crews’s proleptic rebuttal of the arguments he assumes will follow. Alone among the essayists Crews wants to consider notwhatplace psychoanalysis has in contemporary culture butwhetherit should even have a place. Because his perspective leads him to reject the premises of the volume, he shrewdly uses the essays themselves as examples of the circular reasoning and methodological flaws he considers inherent to psychoanalysis.

  Abstract: When I was invited to participate in the symposium whose proceedings are recalled in this book, I accepted with alacrity. Here, I thought, lay the makings of a lively and fruitful debate not merely about
                  whatrole psychoanalysis plays in “contemporary culture” but also aboutwhether it deservesto play such a role. If, as I believe, Freudian ideas tell us nothing that is empirically warrantable about the mind but much about the pitfalls of question-begging discourse, then presumably the application of those same ideas to cultural problems will itself run the risk of overconfidence and even circularity.

  Psychoanalysis and Its Discontents from:

  Abstract: I would like to address two issues that have not only caused some discontent for psychoanalysis, but that seem to emerge internal to psychoanalysis as its own proper sphere of discontent: incest and normative kinship. They are related, most prominently through the incest taboo: what it forecloses on one hand, what it inaugurates and legitimates on the other. I would like to make two separate remarks about incest and kinship. The first concerns contemporary debates on incest and how, and whether, incest can be conceptualized; the second concerns the relation between the prohibition against incest and the institution of normative<br>

  Abstract: The four essayists here come from and work between many disciplines, bridging psychoanalysis with literary interpretation, art criticism, history, and feminist theory. The eclecticism of the group stems from the eclectic texture of Freud’s writing: while always maintaining a base in medical science and therapeutic technique, Freud’s work comes to include an array of essays in interpretation and several monumental theories of history and culture. This part of the volume investigates the relation between the techniques of psychoanalysis as a medical therapy and the application of psychoanalysis as a mode of cultural interpretation, considering questions raised by the unique way<br>

  Abstract: This volume invites us to consider the place of psychoanalysis in contemporary culture. In modern feminism debates pitting cultural against biological causation have played an important role. Such debates have also arisen in relation to research in biotechnology, neurobiology, sociobiology, and ethnomethodology. I think it could be shown that Freud thinks of the body in terms that undermine the opposition between natural causation and cultural meanings that have been with us since Kant first distinguished between the realms of necessity and freedom.

  Abstract: Several years ago I participated in a colloquium on the uses of psychoanalysis and Freudian models at the Hospital of La Salpêtrière in Paris: the place where Freud attended the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot’s lessons in 1885–86.¹ I lectured on what I called “The Image in the Picture,” speaking about Freud’s comments in the
                  Studies on Hysteriaon how, during the cure, images would return to the patient’s mind through the process of description and, by the same token, soon disappear, as if they had been talked away. An interesting problem, and a puzzling one, for the historian of art:<br>

  Abstract: What is the place of a psychoanalysis that exists “between” therapy (considered both as a theory and a practice, but also as a theory
                  ofpractice) and hermeneutics, or the theory of interpretation and understanding? How do we understand “understanding” itself, considered as a mental process involving both analyst and analysand? I want to approach these questions by way of the writing of the British post-Kleinian psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion (1897–1979) . Bion is best known outside psychoanalytic circles as a proponent of the leaderless group and as a theorist of group process.¹ But his collected theoretical and clinical oeuvre<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq728">Whose Freud?</a><br>
  Abstract: This section considers the role of psychoanalysis in posing the question of sexual identity: a question crucial to psychoanalysis, but also one in which Freud’s own views have been most open to attack. Paul Robinson, an intellectual historian, begins by showing how an ambivalent or vacillating perspective toward homosexuality—within Freud’s own work—generates various perspectives on sexual desire and social norms in twentieth-century psychoanalytic thought. On one hand, as Robinson claims, “no one has done more to destabilize the notion of heterosexuality than Freud.” For Freud, the “homosexual object choice” is present in
                  allindividuals’ psychic development; it is<br>

  Abstract: What exactly is psychoanalytic thought, and how might answering this question help us to define what might be called the psychoanalytically constituted subject? One of the most curious aspects of
                  Civilization and Its Discontentsis Freud’s reiterated self-reproach to the effect that he is not speaking psychoanalytically. The work was written in 1929, late in Freud’s career, so it’s not as if he hadn’t had time to develop a distinctively psychoanalytic language. You would think that by now Freud would be “speaking psychoanalysis” fluently. But the complaints start in Chapter 3, where he laments that “so far we have discovered<br>

  Abstract: Near the beginning of his essay Robert Jay Lifton argues: “Without psychoanalysis, we don’t have a psychology worthy of address to history and society or culture. But at the same time, if we employ psychoanalysis in its most pristine state, its most traditional form, we run the risk of eliminating history in the name of studying it.” The eclectic essays in this part all point to both the “worth” and the “risk” of a psychoanalytically inflected historiography.

  Abstract: In this essay I wish to discuss my work not as applied psychoanalysis—that term still has some of the aura of early psychoanalytic imperialism, Freud’s talk about “conquering” various spheres of thought—but rather in connection with psychoanalysis as its source. My work in psychohistorical areas begins with psychoanalytic influence, and never loses that influence, but it does evolve in its own way in certain additional directions. There is a real paradox here, important to keep in mind particularly in historical and cultural studies: without psychoanalysis, we don’t have a psychology worthy of address to history and society or<br>

  Abstract: What relations are there between Freud’s theories of the mind and modern functional brain imaging experiments? To anchor this question, we present two statements from Mark Solms’s recent article about the nature of consciousness.¹ First, Solms emphasized Freud’s definition that “mental processes are in themselves unconscious,” arguing the relevance of this definition to modern controversies about brainmind-consciousness. We are willing to accept a moderate form of this position, in which the unconscious is acknowledged to contribute significantly to mental processes. The second quotation is less familiar: “psychoanalysis and PET scanning study one and the same underlying object: the mental apparatus<br>

  Abstract: Panel Six places philosophical models of truthfulness face to face with the psychoanalytic session. Whereas psychoanalytic theory relies on a horizon of truthfulness, psychoanalytic praxis revolves around an alert attention to the probable fictiveness of the analysand’s truth (intentional statements, recovered memories) and the probable truthfulness of his or her fictions (performative acting-out, symbolic transferences). As a comment in the discussion section puts it: “the manifest, apparent story or truth sometimes is only a communication about a hidden more interesting truth”; or as John Forrester more dramatically claims, in psychoanalysis “a ‘no’ may mean ‘yes’, and a ‘yes’ almost certainly<br>

Although we come to see why Wittgenstein did not view psychoanalysis as a science proper, we are nonetheless made to feel the philosopher's sense of wonder and respect for the cultural task Freud took on as he found new ways meaningfully to discuss human concerns. Intertwined in this story of Wittgenstein's grappling with the theory of the unconscious is the story of how he came to question the authority of science and of philosophy itself. While aiming primarily at the clarification of Wittgenstein's opinion of Freud, Bouveresse's book can be read as a challenge to the French psychoanalytic school of Lacan and as a provocative commentary on cultural authority.<br>

  Foreword from:

  Author(s) DESCOMBES VINCENT<br>
  Abstract: In its original version, Jacques Bouveresse’s essay on Wittgenstein and psychoanalysis bears both a title and a subtitle, each of them unusually explicit:
                  Philosophy, Mythology, and Pseudo-Science: Wittgenstein Reads Freud. The subtitle,Wittgenstein Reads Freud, defines the book’s subject—namely, Wittgenstein’s judgments on Freud and, more generally, his attitude toward the man and his enterprise. The title,Philosophy, Mythology, and Pseudo-Science, announces the ultimate thrust of the entire discussion by introducing three intellectual categories: a new idea can come from eitherphilosophy,mythology, orscience. We can see that among these three registers, which share responsibility for intellectual invention, science<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt8cj">Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious</a><br>
  Abstract: It would be futile to search the work of Wittgenstein for a thorough discussion or systematic critique of psychoanalysis. Freud’s theory is not the focus of any carefully argued statement, and the materials available to us on this subject are rather contained in conversations reported by Rush Rhees and in what are often brief, allusive remarks scattered throughout Wittgenstein’s published writings and manuscripts. Psychoanalysis most often serves as an illustration in the context of much broader philosophical discussions concerning questions such as the distinction between reasons and causes, “aesthetic” explanation and causal explanation, the nature of symbolism in general, of<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

  1  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpmh">Interpreting Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: Like other disciplines in our universities, psychoanalysis has lately been reinterpreted as a hermeneutic discipline. Indeed, many traditional hermeneuts have singled out psychoanalysis, among the human sciences, as the exemplar of a hermeneutic discipline, and many psychoanalysts proclaim themselves converts to the hermeneutic reading of their discipline. An equally large number of psychoanalysts, however, repudiate that reading and reaffirm traditional understandings. The arguments for their repudiation are many, but in this book I am concerned with one in particular: the idea that, if patients were informed of the true nature of psychoanalysis on the hermeneutic reading, they would reject psychoanalysis<br>

  2  The Hermeneutic Analytic Thinkers from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpmh">Interpreting Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: I have selected eight representative thinkers who have written about hermeneutic psychoanalysis for consideration in this chapter. They are a disparate group in many ways: some are practicing psychoanalysts, some are not; some have written extensively about hermeneutic psychoanalysis, some have not; some have written at one time, some at another; some have one clinical view, some another. Indeed, several of these thinkers might reject the idea of being grouped with the others. But that is part of the point: these people sound quite a lot like each other but are actually very different. I select these eight thinkers, then,<br>

  4  The Plausibility of the Story Model of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpmh">Interpreting Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: I want to evaluate the five visions of hermeneutic analysis primarily in terms of the argument from patient rejection; each vision may have additional weaknesses and strengths that I do not discuss. The story model is most vulnerable to the argument, and I devote the most attention to it. The other versions of hermeneutic psychoanalysis are less vulnerable to the argument or possibly vulnerable to it only in a different form.¹ Thus, in the course of discussing the models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, I identify a strong and a weak version of the argument from patient rejection. Later I return to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpmh">Interpreting Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: On the clinical psychoanalysis model, psychoanalysts give interpretations that refer to psychological states, conscious and unconscious, that help explain behavior, and they eschew interpretations that refer to neurophysiological antecedents of behavior. But the interpretations referring to these psychological states are true in<br>

  6  The Weak Form of the Argument from Patient Rejection Revisited from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpmh">Interpreting Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: The strong form of the argument from patient rejection seems to me robust vis-à-vis the story model of hermeneutic psychoanalysis. That argument says that patients not only will, but also ought to, reject psychoanalytic interpretations because analysts are asking them to believe things that do not purport to be possibly true. The strong form of the argument applies to the story model alone because on all of the other models psychoanalytic interpretations purport to be true in at least some sense of “true.” A more sophisticated version of the strong form of the argument, which questions whether patients will accept<br>

  Book Title: Does Psychoanalysis Work?-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): WALDRON SHERWOOD<br>
  Abstract: This important book is a thorough survey of every major study of the efficacy of psychoanalytic treatment. The authors-all well-known psychoanalysts-critically analyze the studies and their findings, discuss the issues that have been and should be explored in such studies, and examine the problems in conducting research into psychoanalytic outcomes. The authors begin by providing a definition of psychoanalysis, establishing central psychoanalytic goals, and determining what questions need to be addressed in assessing whether analysis is effective. They then describe their methods and criteria for evaluating modern research on psychoanalytic outcome and apply these criteria to four major studies of adult psychoanalytic patients, several studies of child and adolescent analysis, and some small-group studies. They find that all the studies show that psychoanalysis is an effective treatment for many patients-and that some cherished assumptions about psychoanalysis are probably wrong. In the final part of the book, the authors address the challenges of collecting empirical data on psychoanalysis and explore the possibilities inherent in the single-case study.<br>

  [PART I Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: Despite the extensive advances in psychotherapy research during the past quarter-century (Garfield and Bergin, 1994; Roth and Fonagy, 1996), there have been few systematic efforts to address questions about psychoanalysis as therapy. Psychotherapy research, as a distinct and largely independent discipline, not to be confused with the practice of psychotherapy, involves systematic and empirical studies of psychotherapy process and outcome. It has gradually moved from fledgling attempts at empirical investigation, through a period of attempts to approximate a model of then-current medical research, to an increasing focus on interactive, subjective, and humanistic aspects of study (Orlinsky and Russel, 1994).

  1  What Is Psychoanalysis? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: A first step in studying whether psychoanalysis is effective is to delimit the treatments that will be called psychoanalysis. Freud (1904) defined psychoanalysis as the 
                  interrelated methods of observation, a conceptual system, and a therapeutic procedure. But the details of this interrelation are unclear. What boundaries of technique and theory usefully set off psychoanalytic ideas and processes from other activities? How are various ways of thinking about psychoanalysis interrelated? The question of what activities and theory are legitimately called psychoanalytic pervades the history of the field, often resulting in discord (see, e.g., Freud, 1914b, 1924; Oberndorf, 1953; Roustang, 1976; Turkle,<br>

  2  What Are the Relevant Measures of Psychoanalytic Outcome? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: Answers to questions about the outcomes and efficacy depend on the goals of psychoanalysis. Some people believe psychoanalysis should be judged by its ability to relieve symptoms, while others hold that it is successful to the extent that the patient achieves insight or develops self-analytic capacities (Ticho, 1967). A range of intermediate views are discussed elsewhere in this volume.<br>

  Abstract: Psychoanalytic investigators have repeatedly tried to answer Oberndorf’s (1943) classic question: what type of treatment is best suited to what kind of patient, suffering from what kind of illness, at what point in life, when treated by what kind of analyst, in what manner? A century of clinical experience has taught us much about the fate of different kinds of cases, the clinical management of the array of patients who consult psychoanalysts, the scope and limitations of the psychoanalytic method, and the qualities of patients that make them suitable or unsuited for psychoanalysis. Over the years there have been many<br>

  Abstract: Systematic, methodologically informed research about psychoanalytic outcomes began with the Menninger Foundation Psychotherapy Research Project. This project is by far the most comprehensive published systematic study of psychoanalytic outcomes. In addition, it is a landmark in-depth study of the adult lives of disturbed individuals and is one of the most thorough studies of development in any adult population. It began in 1954, under the leadership of Lewis Robbins and Robert Wallerstein, as a naturalistic, longitudinal, prospective study. Its aim was to discover what kinds of changes take place in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy, and how these changes come about. The<br>

Extensive data were collected, coded, and stored on computer tape about the characteristics and outcomes of 700 cases of psychoanalysis and 885 cases of psychotherapy conducted from 1945 to 1971. This was the first systematic study of an extensive sample of psychoanalytic patients.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: A third major group of studies of the outcome of psychoanalysis began in the 1950s and continues to this day. The project asks what factors observable during the diagnostic evaluation predict satisfactory analytic progress. In 1960 Peter Knapp and his coworkers reported a project designed to investigate the suitability for analysis of 100 supervised analytic cases. The investigation was limited because the cases were studied only through the first year of treatment. Inspired by Knapp’s work, Sashin, Eldred, and Van Amerongen (1975) studied 130 low-fee control cases that were treated by 66 student-analysts between 1959 and 1966. The patients ranged<br>

Also, they all require unsupported inferences beyond their empirical findings if they are to be applied to the work of experienced analysts with the type of patients whom this group of analysts is likely to work with.

  Abstract: The study of child and adolescent analysis has always been placed somewhat apart from work with adults. Freud’s (1909) pessimism that children could be analyzed in ways that approximated analytic work with adults was echoed in Anna Freud’s (1927) early recommendations about child psychoanalysis. Melaine Klein (1921, 1961) consistently recommended a technique in working with children that was essentially identical to her recommendation for working with adults, except that the free association of adults was replaced by play in children. For many years Klein’s ideas had little impact on the clinical work of any but her followers, but by the<br>

  Abstract: Readers of the earlier chapters in this section will be understandably disappointed that, despite the enormous efforts of investigators, systematic research seems to have addressed few questions that are germane to clinical psychoanalytic practice. Either the population studied is too different from the patients ordinarily taken into psychoanalysis, or the measures of outcome and process are too crude to answer the questions that most interest analysts. The analyst wishes for investigative methods that are closer to the methods customarily used in psychoanalysis, addressing issues that confront her in daily work.

  Abstract: In earlier sections of this book we outlined questions about the efficacy, outcomes, and processes of psychoanalysis and summarized the available research data pertinent to these questions. These data show that psychoanalysis is a helpful procedure for many patients. But they do not address a wide range of important issues that we would like to understand better—for example, how the relation of qualities of patients and analysts is reflected in outcome, the relation of psychoanalytic processes and outcome, and the deeper psychological effects of psychoanalysis. Furthermore, each of the systematic investigations we reviewed had technical difficulties. The central problem<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: Increasingly sophisticated research methods promise results from systematic investigations that are more psychoanalytically significant than those of past investigations. However, systematic investigation in psychoanalysis is unfortunately associated in many analysts’ minds, and also in the minds of many friends and foes of psychoanalysis, with a long history of fault finding. This attitude is epitomized in the criticisms of Eysenck (1952, 1966), Hook (1959), Grünbaum (1984, 1994), and Crews and colleagues (1995). Each of these authors asserts a rigidly positivistic view of science and shows that psychoanalysis<br>

  15  Information About Patients from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: Traditionally medical treatments have been organized around the idea that certain qualities of the patient predict the efficacy of treatment. Diagnosis should determine intervention, at least after consideration of other patient attributes, such as overall health, age, and capacity to cooperate in treatment. As we have seen in earlier chapters, this model has not worked well for psychoanalysis. In this chapter we look more closely at ways of describing patients, some of which may prove fruitful in predicting response to treatment.<br>

Do patients seen five times weekly develop more analyzable transferences than those seen less frequently? Are people who have been analyzed better off than unanalyzed people? Do analysts with character structures similar to the patient’s analyze those defenses that patient and analyst share less well than analysts whose defenses are dissimilar to the patient’s (Baudry, 1991)?<br>

  Abstract: All that we have considered in this volume now brings us to our penultimate point—namely, that single-case methods are the most promising line of approach to exploring the efficacy of psychoanalysis. Case studies differ from case reports in that they employ rigorous and systematic means of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data, with the goal of making the epistemological status of the investigation clear. Case studies explore a single situation in depth and attempt to reach valid conclusions on the basis of such exploration. Because this method is most commonly used to describe complex phenomena, and because many case studies<br>

  Abstract: In the following essay, I will trace elements of the metaphysical detective story in the works of Witold Gombrowicz and align them within a psychoanalytic (in particular, Lacanian) framework. For this project, I will draw on the elective affinity between detective fiction and psychoanalysis, which is based—at least partly—on the fact that, like the criminal case, the psychoanalytic case is a knotty problem with death at its center.

This remarkable combination of traditionalism and innovation describes a state elusively beyond any linguistic epistemology—yet resident in any experiential event—and offers a method to capture individual experience of “pure immanence.”¹ The emphasis Deleuze placed on event and experience stimulated the energetic analysis of their interrelations by Alain Badiou, turning philosophy away from cognitive mapping through Kantian categorical imperatives and re/turning it to the world.

  Book Title: Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tauber Alfred I.<br>
  Abstract: Freud began university intending to study both medicine and philosophy. But he was ambivalent about philosophy, regarding it as metaphysical, too limited to the conscious mind, and ignorant of empirical knowledge. Yet his private correspondence and his writings on culture and history reveal that he never forsook his original philosophical ambitions. Indeed, while Freud remained firmly committed to positivist ideals, his thought was permeated with other aspects of German philosophy. Placed in dialogue with his intellectual contemporaries, Freud appears as a reluctant philosopher who failed to recognize his own metaphysical commitments, thereby crippling the defense of his theory and misrepresenting his true achievement. Recasting Freud as an inspired humanist and reconceiving psychoanalysis as a form of moral inquiry, Alfred Tauber argues that Freudianism still offers a rich approach to self-inquiry, one that reaffirms the enduring task of philosophy and many of the abiding ethical values of Western civilization.<br>

That position and career have been among the most influential in this century.<br>

  Abstract: The interpretation of dreamsdeserves to be regarded as Freud’s masterpiece, in two widely accepted meanings of that term: a famous work that contains many of his most important ideas, and the work that qualified him not merely as a member but as the founder of a guild. Among those most devoted to the study of psychoanalysis, both insiders and outsiders have affirmed the book’s prominence. The early disciple and official biographer Ernest Jones calls it “Freud’s most original work,” which established “a secure basis for the theory of the unconscious in man” and remains “the best known and most<br>

A series of increasingly biting attacks were being made by writers such as Adolf Grünbaum, Jeffrey Masson, Frederick Crews, even Gloria Steinem, that represented the father of psychoanalysis patriarchal, sexist, unscientific, capricious, irrational, egotistical, deluded, paranoid, dishonest, sexually perverted, and just plain wrong. Many people apparently felt that the time had come simply to junk Freud and his ideas altogether.<br>

  Abstract: In the conclusion of his major treatise,
                  Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre announces that his next endeavour will be to deal with ethics. In the last section, “Ethical Implications,” he tells of how ontology and existential psychoanalysis can inform the individual that he or she is free and the source of all values. However, ontology and existential psychoanalysis cannot give moral prescriptions. All questions relative to freedom and how this freedom will deal with its situation are questions “which refer us to a pure and not an accessory reflection, [and] can find their reply only on the ethical plane.

  Book Title: Gender and Narrativity-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): RUTLAND BARRY<br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine a community that is not divided into at least two gender groups. It is equally impossible to imagine a community that does not tell or enact stories. The relationship between these universal aspects of human culture is the mainspring of Gender and Narrativity. From Genesis to Freud, the Western narrative tradition tells the same old story of masculine dominance/feminine subservience as a matter of divine will or natural truth. Here, nine Canadian scholars challenge and interpret this tradition, in effect "re-telling" the story of gender, and themselves intervening in the narrative process. Critical readings from a wide range of literary texts - medieval and modern, European and Canadian - replace abstract theory in these studies, while sociology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and new history are the axes of discussion. This book exemplifies the current range and diversity of Canadian critical writing.<br>

  Book Title: Dark Traces of the Past-Psychoanalysis and Historical Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains an open debate that is full of tension, in both a positive and a negative sense. In particular, the following question has not been answered satisfactorily: what distinguishes a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities from a historical psychoanalysis? Skepticism and fear of collaboration dominate on both sides. Initiating a productive dialogue between historical studies and psychoanalysis seems to be plagued by ignorance and, at times, a sense of helplessness. Interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. Empirical research, formulation of theory, and the development of methods are essentially carried out within the conventional disciplinary boundaries. This volume undertakes to overcome these limitations by combining psychoanalytical and historical perspectives and thus exploring the underlying "unconscious" dimensions and by informing academic and nonacademic forms of historical memory. Moreover, it puts special emphasis on transgenerational forms of remembrance, on the notion of trauma as a key concept in this field, and on case studies that point the way to further research.<br>

  Book Title: Origins and Ends of the Mind-Philosophical Essays on Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis claims that the individual human mind is structured by its childhood relationships with its parents. But the theory of attachment, evolutionary psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind have all recently re-introduced new dimensions of innateness into mental development and pathology. If attachment is an instinct, then what is the psychological status of the child's relation to the mother? If the mind is in part a product of evolution, then how far down do the inhibitory mechanisms of the mind go? If the mind of the child is shaped by their encounter with a set of prohibitions, how, in the light of contemporary 'cognitive science' and philosophy of mind, can the child be conceived as 'taking on' a rule? How is the construction of the mind related to the normative ends of cognitive experience? Today, it is Lacanian psychoanalysis which most vigorously defends psychoanalytic theory and practice from the encroachment of the biological and 'cognitive' sciences. But a paradigm shift nevertheless appears to be underway, in which the classical psychoanalytic theories about the Oedipus complex, primary and secondary repression, sexual difference and psychosexuality, the role of symbols,etc, are being dismantled and reintegrated into a new synthesis of biological and psychological theories. In this collection of theoretical essays by philosophers and psychoanalysts, encounters are brought about between Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis on the one hand, and attachment theory, evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind on the other.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdz7w">Origins and Ends of the Mind</a><br>
  Author(s) Kerslake Christian<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, Freudian psychoanalysis stood apart from other theories of the unconscious in relating the emergence of unconscious mental formations directly back to events and fantasies that shaped the mind in childhood. Freud decisively rejected all metaphysical and dialectical accounts of the emergence of consciousness from a nebulous unconscious (theories which had their roots in the idealism of Hegel, Schelling and Schopenhauer). He rejected Breuer’s claim (derived from the Janet school) that the presence of ‘hypnoid’ dissociative states was a necessary condition for the repression of a representation. The emergence of the unconscious, insofar as it was fundamentally related<br>

  The Missing Link between Psychoanalysis and Attachment Theory: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdz7w">Origins and Ends of the Mind</a><br>
  Author(s) Van Haute Philippe<br>
  Abstract: It is commonplace to state that the various object-relations theories are more easily reconciled with attachment theory than Freudian psychoanalysis. Freud invariably
                  derivesboth the libidinal directedness towards an object and the attachment tendency from the need for love or food. He fails to posit attachment as a primary tendency which needs no further ontogenetic elucidation. In this way, he inevitably comes into conflict with attachment theory which emphasizes the originality and non-deducibility of this tendency (Geyskens & Van Haute 2003). Object-relations theories, on the other hand, teach us that the libido is first and foremost directed towards finding adequate objects.<br>

  Abstract: Towards the end of ‘The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis’, the so-called ‘Rome Discourse’ published in
                  Écrits, Lacan gives an encomium to the practice of psychoanalysis: ‘Of all the undertakings that have been proposed in this century’, he says, ‘that of the psychoanalyst is the loftiest, because [his] undertaking acts in our time as the mediator between the man of care and the subject of absolute knowledge’ (Lacan 1953a: 106). I take this to mean that for the early Lacan, the psychoanalyst has a privileged position in mediating an emergent knowledge of the subject and a<br>

  Author(s) Beeckman Tinneke<br>
  Abstract: In what way can Freudian psychoanalysis help contribute to a naturalist, yet non-reductionist anthropology? Such an anthropology would be one that takes into account the significance of the natural history of the human species for our understanding of the human being, but without reducing the specificity of the human to processes of natural or sexual selection. The question of reductionism is all the more relevant today given that naturalism has become a major paradigm in contemporary philosophy. Simply put, naturalism’s basic tenet is that human beings are genealogically related to each other and have common ancestors with other species. Nevertheless,<br>

  Author(s) Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis has, from its origins, remained indifferent to or suspicious towards ontology. More precisely, the practice of psychoanalysis has not necessitated that clinical psychoanalysts intervene directly in ontological questioning, whether implicitly or explicitly. Even in the most volatile moments of its struggles to sustain itself as a singular practice, psychoanalysis has remained relatively unmoved in the face of the counter-claims, concepts and criticisms coming from philosophy — and,
                  a fortiori, from philosophical ontologies. Indeed, the reverse seems to have been the case: it is philosophers who have had to respond, with some urgency, to the challenges offered by psychoanalysis. However<br>

  Abstract: In the introductory chapter of

In March 1972, soon after the publication ofAnti-Oedipus, Foucault tells to his friend: “We have to get rid of Freudo-Marxism.”¹ To which Deleuze replies, “I’m taking care of Freud, will you deal with Marx?”² The revival of the concept of desire in the first volume ofCapitalism and Schizophreniarepresents to a certain extent not simply a radical critique of psychoanalysis and of the ‘Oedipus complex’, but maybe also Deleuze’s part of the bargain with his long-time friend.<br>

  Abstract: There is no straightforward way to say what schizoanalysis is. The problem is not so much that the question is not answered by Deleuze and Guattari or that it is somehow unanswerable; rather the problem is that it has several answers. Unwilling to provide any kind of ‘formula’ or ‘model’ that would enable us to simply ‘do’ schizoanalysis as a tick-box exercise in which everything relates inexorably to one single factor (e.g. the family), which is what they thought psychoanalysis had become, Deleuze and Guattari observe a quite deliberate strategy of providing multiple answers to the questions their work raises.<br>

  Abstract: Continental feminist philosophy is a movement of thought unified by the theme of the difference of woman and the difference of the feminine. But it is by no means monolithic in method or content. It begins with Simone de Beauvoir’s existentialist feminism in the 1940s. For de Beauvoir, the free transcendence of the ‘independent woman’ wrests her from linear history and orients her to something more than equal rights for man and woman, something more than egalitarian ideals. With May 1968 a new phase of French feminist theory began, bringing along with it aesthetic experiences, influences from deconstruction, psychoanalysis and<br>

  Author(s) Cronin Ciaran<br>
  Abstract: The adjective ‘unconscious’ designates a quality that can be found in psychical processes such as imagining, remembering, thinking, feeling, desiring, wishing and acting. The processes which exhibit this quality differ from those with the quality ‘conscious’ in that the former are not present in the current field of consciousness but nevertheless remain psychologically effective, indeed, often far more so than the processes which have the quality of being conscious. The substantive, the ‘unconscious’, expresses the fact that psychological phenomena are not confined in principle to conscious experiences but are profoundly shaped by unconscious forces. In psychoanalysis, this concept also designates<br>

  Abstract: Jacques Rancière’s book
                  The Emancipated Spectatormarks his first sustained discussion of spectatorship (Rancière 2008b; 2009a).¹ This might seem a surprisingly late addition to Rancière’s project of rethinking the conjunction of art and politics. From the disciplinary perspective of Anglo-American film studies, it is a belated intervention indeed. For the question of the spectator is the terrain upon which many of the most significant disciplinary battles over the politics of film theory have been waged over the past three decades. In that time, critical approaches to spectators have proliferated: feminist revisions of psychoanalysis; cultural studies models of differentially ‘decoding’ viewers;<br>

  Book Title: Death-Drive-Freudian Hauntings in Literature and Art<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Robert Rowland<br>
  Abstract: Robert Rowland Smith takes Freud's work on the death-drive and compares it with other philosophies of death - Pascal, Heidegger and Derrida in particular. He also applies it in a new way to literature and art - to Shakespeare, Rothko and Katharina Fritsch, among others. He asks whether artworks are dead or alive, if artistic creativity isn't actually a form of destruction, and whether our ability to be seduced by fine words means we don't put our selves at risk of death. In doing so, he proposes a new theory of aesthetics in which artworks and literary texts have a death-drive of their own, not least by their defining ability to turn away from all that is real, and where the effects of the death-drive mean that we are constantly living in imaginary, rhetorical or 'artistic' worlds. The book also provides a valuable introduction to the rich tradition of work on the death-drive since Freud.Key Features* Includes a general introduction to the death-drive* Presents an original theory of aesthetics* Analyses both theoretical and clinical psychoanalysis* Offers in-depth treatment of Freud* Provides an overview of philosophies of death<br>

  Abstract: My title alludes to an essay by Jean-François Lyotard, ‘The Dream-Work Does Not Think’,¹ which in turn alludes to Freud’s
                  Interpretation of Dreams. The issue is whether the Freudian theory of psychoanalysis construes the individual psyche as having any capacity tothinkwhatsoever. It might be problematised thus: if the psychic mechanism is compelled to repeat, can any of its intellections be considered as thought or cogitation, as opposed to Pavlovian reaction? The compulsion to repeat is one – perhaps the arch – element making the psychic mechanism mechanical, hence the structural role it plays, and consequently its tolerance of<br>

  Book Title: The Lacanian Left-Psychoanalysis, Theory, Politics<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stavrakakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: In recent years psychoanalysis – especially Lacanian theory – has been gradually acknowledged as a vital resource in the ongoing re-orientation of contemporary political theory and analysis. Of particular note is that the work of Jacques Lacan is increasingly being used by major political philosophers associated with the Left. This indicates the dynamic emergence of a new theoretico-political horizon: that of the ‘Lacanian Left’. However, this has yet to be properly conceived and structured as a field. The Lacanian Left is the first book to bring it into academic consciousness and to draw its implications for concrete political analysis in a systematic way. It offers:• An accessible mapping of its main contours. • A detailed examination of the points of convergence and divergence between the major figures active or at the periphery of this terrain, including Slavoj h the central Lacanian notion of ‘enjoyment’, The Lacanian Left puts forward innovative analyses of political power and authority, nationalism, European identity, consumerism and advertising culture, de-democratisation and post-democracy. It will be of value to everyone interested in exploring the potential of psychoanalysis to reinvigorate political theory, critical political analysis and democratic politics.<br>

  Abstract: Over the last ten to fifteen years, psychoanalysis, and especially Lacanian theory, has emerged as one of the most important resources in the ongoing re-orientation of contemporary political theory and critical analysis. So much so is now acknowledged even in mainstream political science fora. For example, in a critical review essay recently published in the 
                  British Journal of Politics and International Relations – one of the journals of the UK Political Studies Association – and characteristically entitled ‘The Politics of Lack’, one reads that ‘an approach to politics drawn from Lacanian psychoanalysis is becoming increasingly popular of late among theorists . .<br>

  Book Title: Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis was the most important intellectual development of the twentieth century, which left no practice from psychiatry to philosophy to politics untouched. Yet it was also in many ways an untouchable project, caught between science and poetry, medicine and hermeneutics. This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis is an antiphilosophy. Despite the precision of this concept and this claim, their implications remain controversial. This book thus introduces the concept of antiphilosophy, speaks of its constitution and pertinence with respect to psychoanalysis, and examines the consequences of such a determination through a sequence of case-studies. Although the concept has some highly abstract aspects and a somewhat forbidding intellectual history, it is deployed here, first, as a kind of corrosive of received ideas, and, second, as an affirmative means of characterising psychoanalysis that captures something essential, if often elided, about the peculiar status of the practice.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I will reread an overdetermined and complex event in the prehistory of psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud’s so-called ‘cocaine episode’ from the 1880s, in which, prior to entering private practice as a psychiatrist, Freud attempted a kind of reputational ‘get-rich-quick’ scheme, staking his scientific credentials on what has appeared to many subsequent commentators as unethical drug experimentation. While I re-examine this event by drawing on the requisite historical facts and secondary literature, my aim is different from that of a standard revisionist account. In fine, I wish to show something quite counter-intuitive: how Freud came to imagine the possibility<br>

  2.  Love as Ontology; or, Psychoanalysis against Philosophy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Because it is an antiphilosophy, psychoanalysis has, from its beginnings, remained indifferent or suspicious towards that most philosophical of themes: ontology. One can see this indifference operating at a number of levels. The practice of psychoanalysis has not necessitated that clinical psychoanalysts intervene directly in ontological questioning, whether implicitly or explicitly. Even in the most volatile moments of its struggles to sustain itself as a singular practice, psychoanalysis has remained relatively unmoved in the face of the counter-claims, concepts and criticisms coming from philosophy – and, a fortiori, from philosophical ontologies. Indeed, the reverse is more the case: it is<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The previous chapters pinpointed a new form of the ancient relationship between ‘slavery’ and ‘alienation’ emerging at the origins of psychoanalysis in the form of the relationship between drug-addiction and sexuality. The first chapter also showed how this emergence was coterminous with Freud’s forced transition from scientific experimentation to linguistic interlocution; that is, it entailed Freud’s departure from a strictly scientific field and directed him into situations that, while never abandoning a guiding ideal of science, required supplementation by the extra-scientific armature derived from a form of attentiveness to ‘literature’. In terms of the ‘therapy’ offered by psychoanalysis, this required<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In the preceding chapters, I tried to show how psychoanalysis emerged as an antiphilosophy and, in this emergence, came to establish certain routines as its own: the diagnosis of slavery as the consequence of the encounter between the body and language, a concomitant intrication of sexual protest, the ambivalence of love as at once mediating, obscuring and transforming this relation between slavery and sex, and, finally, the development of an ethics of poetic invention. This chapter, by contrast, turns its attentions to a different kind of thinker: one who begins as a self-nominated ‘philosopher’, but who, in covertly drawing from<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I examined the problem of slave-speech under the heading of the ‘Aesopic’: how a slave, whose speech can only have public standing when it is extracted through legal torture, can nonetheless transform the obscenity of such restrictions into inventive utterance. I also argued that psychoanalysis was
                  thecontemporary discourse that affirms the speech of slaves, against the depredations of authoritarian dispensations. Yet, by this very affirmation, psychoanalysis should also alert us to the centrality of torture in the formation and maintenance of human polities.

  Abstract: The previous chapter ended with a dilemma: if the human is that ‘living being’ which can actually be separated from what once was held to be its essence, that is, ‘language’, what possible effectivity – whether of diagnosis or treatment – is left to psychoanalysis? The ongoing psychiatric, pharmaceutical and philosophical assault against psychoanalysis is one thing; the loss of its very basis for being is quite another. The first, as I have shown throughout this book, is hardly the threat to psychoanalysis that it is often supposed to be; but the second would be fatal. The second, in fact,<br>

  Book Title: American Night-The Literary Left in the Era of the Cold War<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): WALD ALAN M.<br>
  Abstract: American Night, the final volume of an unprecedented trilogy, brings Alan Wald's multigenerational history of Communist writers to a poignant climax. Using new research to explore the intimate lives of novelists, poets, and critics during the Cold War, Wald reveals a radical community longing for the rebirth of the social vision of the 1930s and struggling with a loss of moral certainty as the Communist worldview was being called into question. The resulting literature, Wald shows, is a haunting record of fracture and struggle linked by common structures of feeling, ones more suggestive of the "negative dialectics" of Theodor Adorno than the traditional social realism of the Left.Establishing new points of contact among Kenneth Fearing, Ann Petry, Alexander Saxton, Richard Wright, Jo Sinclair, Thomas McGrath, and Carlos Bulosan, Wald argues that these writers were in dialogue with psychoanalysis, existentialism, and postwar modernism, often generating moods of piercing emotional acuity and cosmic dissent. He also recounts the contributions of lesser known cultural workers, with a unique accent on gays and lesbians, secular Jews, and people of color. The vexing ambiguities of an era Wald labels "late antifascism" serve to frame an impressive collective biography.<br>

This theory runs through a vast panorama of universal history, which is painted in the book’s central chapter in a quaintly archaic style that could make the anthropological reader wince. Not only does it employ the venerable savagery-barbarism-civilization triad, but the proliferating ethnographic references are treated in a seemingly<br>

  Abstract: Atavism demonstrates, sometimes quite poignantly, that the body does not coincide with its present. It dramatizes the past as in communication with the present; it insists that the past and the present are temporal spheres fused in continuity. By making manifest a disordered temporality, the atavistic body demonstrates something of the nature of cultural preoccupations in late modernity. At the same time, the epistemological projects orbiting around this body demonstrate something of the nature of the formal procedures exercised in the scientific pursuit of corporeal mastery. If those procedures may be seen in psychoanalysis and medical photography, they also emerge<br>

In order to account for the gap between enunciation and utterance, Lacan introduces a first distinction that splits the “I” of the discourse of the subject from the enunciation.

  Abstract: This volume presents a sample of contemporary critical work now being done in Spain. More often than not, “theory” is a word associated with France, Germany, and the United States. Seldom do we read how Spanish scholars are examining and using critical perspectives such as psychoanalysis, deconstruction, discourse analysis, text theory, or the aesthetics of reception. The essays presented here, submitted by professors of communication and literary theory in the Spanish university system, differ not only in their problematics but also in style and presentation from what one is accustomed to seeing in the United States.

  Abstract: Jorge E. Jinkis, in his fundamental article “A Topical Distinction: The Subject of the Enunciation and the I of Discourse,” follows the split present in Lacanian writings between enunciation and utterance. He analyzes the different conceptual value that Roman Jakobson’s shifter, that is, that which articulates utterance with true enunciation, has in Lacanian psychoanalysis. In order to account for the gap between enunciation and utterance, Lacan introduces a first distinction that splits the “I” of the discourse of the subject from the enunciation.

  Abstract: Ever resisting the temptation to be born again, even today, as we mark the one-hundredth anniversary of its initializing text, psychoanalysis was from the start just about the only one to confront human cruelty, the punishing aspects of the psyche, without a theological alibi—in fact, with no alibi or safety net. Psychoanalysis ventured forth without an alibi—with no excuse, as it were. This is one of Derrida’s recent themes: that psychoanalysis met head-on with unbearable examples of suffering, but took no recourse to theology. It may have scanned monotheism, or even served as witness for Dr. Schreber when<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

  Abstract: It can be tempting to describe Jacques Derrida’s work as in large measure an extension of psychoanalysis into the history of philosophy. Despite Derrida’s insistence to the contrary (in the section called “The Exorbitant Question of Method”), the reading of Rousseau offered in
                  Of Grammatology—probably the work best known to Derrida’s English-speaking audience—looks like a particularly sophisticated variety of psychobiographical analysis, showing the inevitable inscription of the word “supplement”—the word with which Rousseau would name writing, his own writing in relation to speech, and culture in relation to nature—in a larger psychosexual economy (in which it<br>

  Abstract: In the masterful style that has become his artistic signature, Péter Forgács performs the task of a clinical archivist, evoking fragments of life stories, intercut with minimal explanatory material, through found footage and home movies in much the same way as psychoanalysis creates a narrativized intertext of continuities and discontinuities, of transference and countertransference, and of resistance and free association. The film-maker’s approach recalls that of Alain Resnais in

  Abstract: It has become commonplace to claim that mid-century literature owed much to Freud. The social theorist Eli Zaretsky explains that “For many [fifties intellectuals] Freud was at the center of [an] antirationalizing return to the personal” (“Charisma” 347).¹ Helen Vendler suggests that “the most inclusive rubric, perhaps” for “the lyric poetry written in America immediately after World War II is ‘Freudian lyric’ ” (
                  Given 31). Alan Williamson calls Jarrell, rightly, “the most consciously psychoanalytic even of the poets of the ‘confessional’ generation” (“Märchen” 283).

  Abstract: “In order to have a sense of who we are,” writes Charles Taylor, “we have to have a notion of how we have become, and of where we are going” (47). The unconscious (in psychoanalytic terms) bears traces of early experience; clinical practice moves from present experience to its roots in the recent or distant past. For these reasons and others, Jarrell’s poems often seek a past self within present experience, or a child within an adult. With help from concepts central to psychoanalysis, and from literary sources such as Wordsworth and Proust, his characters try to understand themselves as<br>

  Abstract: Sigmund Freud, still the most cited person in psychology, began as a scientist looking intensely at the nervous system. The need to earn a living to support his family, and perhaps Viennese anti-Semitism, drove him out of the research university and into private medical practice. There, treating neurotic patients, he developed the discipline that was to become psychoanalysis. In doing so, Freud moved from the study of a natural object, the nervous system organized like all natural objects into hierarchies, to the study of the brain and the mind, the latter a natural object and a cultural object.

  Book Title: The Awakened Ones-Phenomenology of Visionary Experience<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of the Cold War but also the rise of a melancholic vision of history as a series of losses. For the political left, the cause lost was communism, and this trauma determined how leftists wrote the next chapter in their political struggle and how they have thought about their past since. Throughout the twentieth century, argues

  Abstract: In response to a conference on the role of theory in society held at the University of Chicago on April 11, 2003, the

The grand paradigms that swept through humanities departments in the 20th century—psychoanalysis, structuralism, Marxism, deconstruction, post-colonialism—have lost favor or been abandoned. Money is tight. And the left ist politics with which literary theorists have traditionally been associated have taken a beating” (9).¹ In this chapter I look at how several scholars have responded to<br>

  Author(s): JAMESON FREDRIC<br>
  Abstract: Jameson applies his interpretive theory to nineteenth- and twentieth-century texts, including the works of Balzac, Gissing, and Conrad. Throughout, he considers other interpretive approaches to the works he discusses, assessing the importance and limitations of methods as different as Lacanian psychoanalysis, semiotics, dialectical analysis, and allegorical readings. The book as a whole raises directly issues that have been only implicit in Jameson's earlier work, namely the relationship between dialectics and structuralism, and the tension between the German and the French aesthetic traditions.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610442152">After Parsons</a><br>
  Author(s) Bershady Harold J.<br>
  Abstract: From the 1930s to the mid-1960s, Talcott Parsons was the leading contributor to the development of sociological theory, in the United States and internationally. More than any other contemporary figure, he shaped the conceptual schemes used in research, the bodies of theory taught to students, and thinking about the issues requiring investigation at the frontiers of sociological knowledge. In some dozen books and hundreds of essays, he elaborated an unfolding theoretical system that not only had a far-reaching, formative influence on sociological thought and research but also extended to other social sciences, including economics, political science, anthropology, psychology, and psychoanalysis.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Author(s): Marcus Sharon<br>
Abstract: In the text-based disciplines, psychoanalysis and Marxism have had a major influence on how we read, and this has been expressed most consistently in the practice of symptomatic reading, a mode of interpretation that assumes that a text's truest meaning lies in what it does not say, describes textual surfaces as superfluous, and seeks to unmask hidden meanings. For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.<br>

Abstract: Es wird der Begriff der „Lebensgeschichte“ zur Diskussion gestellt. Am Beispiel ausgewählter Therapie-Konzeptionen (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) wird gezeigt, daß in jeder therapeutischen Richtung verschiedene Segmente des lebensgeschichtlichen Problemfeldes isoliert, ausgearbeitet und zum Ansatzpunkt des therapeutischen Handelns gemacht werden. Die entsprechenden Konsequenzen für Diagnostik, Therapie und Forschung werden im Blick auf aktuelle Strömungen der therapeutischen Psychoanalyse (Ich-Psychologie, Narzißmus-Analyse, Repräsentanzenlehre, hermeneutische Psychoanalyse) verdeutlicht. The concept of „life history“ is the theme of this discussion. Working from a selection of therapy models (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) it can be shown that in every therapeutic approach various segments from the problem area of life histories in general can be isolated, developed and made into the central point of therapeutic activity. The relevant consequences for diagnosis, therapy and research will be clarified with respect to present-day movements in therapeutic psychoanalysis (ego-psychology, the analysis of narcissism, hermeneutic psychoanalysis).<br>

Abstract: Unsere Literaturübersicht diskutiert die Frage, ob und inwieweit eine reife Liebesfähigkeit Erwachsener von entsprechenden Früherfahrungen abhängt bzw. inwieweit Liebe und Partnerschaft eine Korrektur ungünstiger emotionaler Erfahrungen der frühen Kindheit ermöglichen. Bestimmte Partnerschaftsstörungen stehen zu konkreten familiären Gegebenheiten der ersten Lebensjahre in keinem zwingenden Bezug. Sind Partnerschaftsstörungen nach traditioneller psychoanalytischer Auffassung als Folge eines ungelösten infantilen Konfliktes anzusehen, so greifen neuere Ansätze angesichts des weitgehenden Fehlens einer psychoanalytischen Interaktionstheorie bei der Beschreibung und Erklärung interpersoneller Phänomene zunehmend auf systemische Ansätze zurück. Äußerungen psychoanalytischer Autoren zur Entwicklung der Liebesfähigkeit reflektieren im historischen Überblick wesentliche Veränderungen der Theoriebildung. Neuere empirische Arbeiten weisen auf Korrektur- und Kompensationsmöglichkeiten ungünstiger Früherfahrungen von mittlerem Schweregrad hin. Dafür aber dürfte die warme und bedürfnisgerechte Zuwendung durch eine oder mehrere feste Bezugspersonen (möglichst durch die liebevoll und partnerschaftlich aufeinander bezogenen Eltern) in den ersten Lebensjahren eine grundlegende Voraussetzung erwachsener Liebes- und Partnerschaftsfähigkeit sein. In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal phenomena, recent discussions have drawn increasingly on a systematic approach. From an historical point of view, psychoanalytical discussions reflect essential changes in theories about the ability to love. More recent empirical studies point to a possible involvement of corrective and compensatory mechanisms for unfavorable early experiences of a medium degree of seriousness. Nevertheless, warm affection based on needs during the first years of life (at best from loving parents with a partner-oriented relationship) provides a basis for the adult's ability to love and form partnerships.<br>

Ursprung und Ziel gern reserviert wird, wäre hier unangemessen, weil er die Differenz unter-
schlägt, die Trieb und Mythos wie Unsichtbares und Sichtbares trennt. Freuds Deutung bringt
den Mythos im Trieb zum Verschwinden, aber umgekehrt den Trieb im Teufel zur Präsenz. Die
kulturtheoretischen Erzählungen der Psychoanalyse verschaffen dieser Präsenz eine Bühne, die
nicht nur der Vorführung des Teufels, sondern auch der Demonstration der eigenen erkenntnis-
kritischen Leistung dient; vgl. dazu H. Böhme: Fetischismus und Kultur, a.a.O. [Anm. 9] 408ff.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutic and anti-hermeneutic sides in the debate about psychoanalysis are entangled in an epistemological and methodological antinomy, here exemplified by Grünbaum's and Spence's paradigmatic views. Both contain a partial element of truth, which they assert dialectically one against the other (§§ 1 and 2). This antinomy disappers only by reconciling an operationalist approach with man's ability to suspend the effectiveness of the 'laws' applied to him (§ 3). The hermeneutic way in which the technical-operational criterion of truth works in psychoanalysis demands that clinical and extra-clinical testing methods work synergically, through a fruitful self-correcting strategy, grounded on the very psychoanalytic object: the unconscious (§ 4).<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Abstract: Arguing that the times of scientistic criticism of psychoanalysis are past and that psychoanalysis is now open to new intellectual and scientific horizons, the article aims at showing how the recent developments of neurobiology, cognitive psychology, as well as new theories of therapeutic change in psychoanalysis support a reformulation of the psychoanalytic unconscious. The author defends that the obvious terminological confusion between the neurobiological and cognitive non-conscious on the one hand and the dynamic unconscious, on the other, require clear definitions of differences and of commonalities. Furthermore, the author also develops the idea that the dimensions of awareness and of selfascription (avowal/disavowal) help to determine what is the core of the dynamic unconscious, even though the cognitive non-conscious and the psychoanalytic unconscious overlap to a great extent. The article shows, finally, how a new interdisciplinary consensus offers now a chance for us to recognize the shortcomings of a rationalistic philosophy of mind. /// Argumentando que os tempos de uma crítica da psicanálise a partir do cientismo já passaram e que a psicanálise está agora aberta a novos horizontes intelectuais e científicos, o artigo pretende mostrar até que ponto os desenvolvimentos mais recentes da neurobiologia, da psicologia cognitiva bem como das novas teorias da mudança terapêutica em psicanálise suportam uma reformulação do inconsciente psicanalítico. O autor defende que a óbvia confusão terminológica entre o não-consciente neurobiológico e cognitivo por um lado e o inconsciente dinâmico por outro requerem definições claras das diferenças e dos aspectos comuns. Além disso, o autor desenvolve também a ideia de que as dimensões de conhecimento e de auto-atribuição (reconhecimento/nãoreconhecimento) ajudam a determinar aquilo que constitui o cerne do inconsciente dinâmico, mesmo que o não-consciente cognitivo e o inconsciente psicanalítico se sobreponham em grande medida. O artigo mostra ainda, finalmente, até que ponto um novo consenso interdisciplinar nos oferece agora uma oportunidade para reconhecer as limitações do racionalismo emfilosofia da mente.<br>

Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents a history of the large group approach in relation to Foulkesian group analytic psychotherapy, including the nature of this approach in relation to Foulkesian principles. Much of the theory reflects Foulkes's attitude, but there are also clear distinctions made, notably a new stance in our thinking about groups as a result of the increase in size (i.e., a membership of about 20), the introduction of the cultural dimension which this increase entails, and the question of what happens after the resolution of Kleinian, oedipal and familial conflicts has been achieved in psychoanalysis and small groups, notably what happens once "exile" has been achieved. The approach presented proposes to handle the frustration and hate that these conflicts engender in the form of negative or antilibidinal energies, and their transformation into psychic energy, through dialogue leading from hate to the establishment of koinonia, or impersonal fellowship, and of microcultural influences which promote rather than inhibit communication. Being neither small nor large, a group of about 20 members has become known as a "median" group.<br>

Date: 6 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Visvanathan Susan<br>
Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Author(s): Perrin Christophe<br>
Abstract: S'il déclame contre les deux principes qui sont ceux de Descartes, Sartre se réclame pourtant de lui. Sans doute n'est-il pas à un paradoxe près. Reste qu'il nous faudra ne pas l'être moins pour expliquer le sien. Car certes, le sens du texte qu'il intitule « La liberté cartésienne » et qui articule ce volume de morceaux choisis qu'est Descartes 1596-1650 confère quelque cohérence à cet apparent non-sens. Mais une fois présenté de cette oeuvre le paratexte, il nous faudra affirmer non seulement que celle-ci se lit avant L'être et le néant quoiqu'elle ait été publiée après, mais, plus encore, qu'elle est un ensemble d'écrits de Descartes sur Sartre quoiqu'elle soit un écrit de Sartre sur Descartes. C'est qu'outre l'analyse sartrienne des analyses cartésiennes de la Méditation quatrième, on y trouve une psychanalyse existentielle par l'auteur de son devancier, à l'occasion de laquelle a lieu non pas un transfert, mais un contre-transfert. Although Sartre denounces Descartes' two principles, he nevertheless draws inspiration from him. No doubt this is close to being paradoxical; we shall have to be no less paradoxical in our explanation. For although the text entitled "Cartesian Freedom," which introduces a volume of selections from Descartes, Descartes 1596Ί650, confers some coherence on this apparent non-sense, once the texts surrounding this work have been taken into account, we have to conclude not only that this text predates Beinjj and Nothingness, even though it was published afterwards, but that it is a collection of Descartes' writings on Sartre, even though it is a writing by Sartre on Descartes. For beyond the Sartrean analysis of the Cartesian analyses of the Fourth Meditation, we find Sartre's existential psychoanalysis of his predecessor, in which takes place not a transference, but a counter-transference.<br>

Abstract: Largely due to Benveniste's dismissal ("Language in Freudian Theory," 1951), Freud's review essay of the philologist Karl Abel's "Über den Gegensinn der Urworte" ("On the Antithetical Sense of Primary Words") has been ignored or slighted by most critics of Freud's thought, even those influenced by Lacan's linguistic emphasis. Nonetheless, the essay on "primary antithetical meaning" (Ur-worte) should be of great importance for psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic approaches to art, for it explicitly addresses Freud's persistent identification of the unconscious with antithetical modes of thought. Benveniste's positivist dismissal is relevant to psychoanalysis in general (Freud's theories of bisexuality, Lutschen, and castration fear) and psychoanalytic studies of art in particular (Freud's essays on the "uncanny" in E. T. A. Hoffmann, Friedrich Hebbel's "Judith und Holofernes," Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, and so on.).<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Abstract: In this study of Greek dreams at moments of illness and anxiety I explore the relationship between individual experience and cultural representation. Ethnographic data and textual sources show that the image of fields recurs in dreams, thus throwing into question the uniqueness of personal experience as well as the concept of "experience" as something separate from cultural narratives. Yet these same images might also be independently generated "from below" by the emotional, physical experience of distress and illness. This case points to the convergence of cultural and personal symbols and to their fusion in the moment of experience. Approaches from psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and folklore studies all provide possible theorizations. None of these options excludes the others. The image of the field in dreams is overdetermined precisely because the historicocultural, the cognitive, the psychobiological, and the social all simultaneously figure in human experience. [dreams, experience, psychoanalysis, folklore, cognition, space, Greece]<br>

Abstract: This essay uses the work of psychoanalyst Melanie Klein to reopen the dialogue between anthropology and psychoanalysis. It argues that Kleinian concepts enhance an anthropology that seeks out both intersubjective and intrasubjective difference and disjuncture, and it demonstrates the uses of major Kleinian concepts for addressing classic anthropological problems, including gender classification and the analysis of persecution in witchcraft and sorcery systems. Applying Kleinian concepts to the analysis of cultural-historical process, it shows how splitting and denial may be central to the reproduction and hegemony of dominant cultural systems through time and addresses the question of how to theorize the relationship among dominant cultural systems, social differentiation, and individual subjectivities.<br>

Abstract: This essay compares passages from Freud’s
         Interpretation of Dreams, Michelangelo’s sonnets, and Wittgenstein’sZettelthat include the image of a burning speaker, and suggests how to make sense of such uncanny repetitions between authors and texts. Comparative interpretation is justified less by theoretical understandings of psychoanalysis than by psychoanalytic practices.<br>

Abstract: Desire, as Martin Hägglund claims in
         Dying For Time, has been erringly conceived in philosophical, literary, and psychoanalytic traditions as testifying to a fundamental lack of being. In response, Hägglund develops the notion of chronolibido, a theory that posits the constitutive difference of desire as testifying to temporal finitude and mortality as the object of desire. In the rubric of chronolibido, the desire for immortality dissimulates a preceding desire for survival. This review takes up Hägglund's theory of desire and examines the implications of chronolibido for reading modernist literature.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: The articles collected here represent the richness and diversity of philosophical work presented at SPEP and thus serve to vindicate Steinbock's vision, expressed in his Co-director's Address, of SPEP as an organization that is grounded in a fundamental openness to experience that leads it to continually push against its own limits and thus to reimagine itself.<br>

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>
