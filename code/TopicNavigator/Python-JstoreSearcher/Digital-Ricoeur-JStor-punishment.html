  Book Title: Executing Democracy-Volume One: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hartnett Stephen John<br>
  Abstract: Executing Democracy: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807is the first volume of a rhetorical history of public debates about crime, violence, and capital punishment in America. This examination begins in 1683, when William Penn first struggled to govern the rowdy indentured servants of Philadelphia, and continues up until 1807, when the Federalists sought to impose law-and-order upon the New Republic.This volume offers a lively historical overview of how crime, violence, and capital punishment influenced the settling of the New World, the American Revolution, and the frantic post-war political scrambling to establish norms that would govern the new republic.By presenting a macro-historical overview, and by filling the arguments with voices from different political camps and communicative genres, Hartnett provides readers with fresh perspectives for understanding the centrality of public debates about capital punishment to the history of American democracy.<br>

 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) CERVIGNI DINO S.<br>
  Abstract: Canto X begins the great cycle of penitence and education that characterizes Purgatory proper. The souls in Purgatory follow the order of the seven mortal sins as defined by Christian doctrine. They traverse the seven circles of the mountain, pausing in each circle, for a time, according to their inclination toward each sin that has remained in them after their life on earth. They are not punished for any specific crimes they may have committed, as happens in Dante’s Hell. Instead, at each stage of Purgatory, penitence regularly consists of a meditation and a

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Abstract: Insofar as Western philosophy, like Christianity, begins with a scene of capital punishment—that of Socrates being sentenced and put to death—doesn’t it also have its beginnings in the death penalty? Derrida answers that philosophers from Kant to Levinas justify the death penalty and “just” wars on the basis of
                  lex talionis, which takes us back not only to its theological roots but also to the basis of sovereignty (2004, 146).¹ For the sake of protection by the state, citizens subject themselves to state sovereignty and grant to the state, and only to the state, the power to kill.<br>

  Author(s) Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: Recent financial scandals have raised questions about appropriate forms of punishment for white-collar crimes. Some commentators have argued that punishments for such crimes might need to be reduced from what they would otherwise be because white-collar criminals suffer shame from incarceration in a way that other criminals do not. It is, however, striking that some recent white-collar criminals, for example, Jeffrey Skilling of Enron fame, seem to express neither shame nor remorse at their crimes, but rather seek by all means to have their charges reversed legally.

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

They were attracted first of all by its irresistibly fascinating title: “Crime and Punishment.” The reference to Dostoyevsky’s masterpiece is explicit. In the minds of the show’s curators, crime is synonymous with murder: its paintings, photographs, illustrations, and other forms of documentation all display, in various modes, the crime of murder—that is, the individual offense. As for punishment, it is largely understood in juridical terms. Its symbol is the guillotine: the “merciful” machine, created by the French Revolution to kill in an egalitarian<br>

  Abstract: The evangelical tradition has virtually co-existed, albeit uneasily, with concepts of universal salvation. If the period from 1730 to the mid-1800s is accepted as the heyday of evangelical Protestantism as a movement, its classic conversionist, crucicentrist, biblicist, activist expression² remained paramount throughout. Liberalizing trends were strongly resisted, and incipient universalist tendencies were strenuously repudiated. Faced with challenges to depart from what it saw as an established, traditional, biblical, and doctrinal position with regard to salvation, judgment, and eternal punishment, reaction was usually swift and hostile, often prompting simultaneous renaissance of historic definitive positions.

  Abstract: Ezekiel 16, the problematic narrative of Jerusalem as YHWH’s adopted daughter and faithless wife, has been richly illuminated for contemporary readers by way of postcolonial theory and postmodern literary approaches to metaphor and gender.¹ These interpretations have helped modern readers move from initial feelings of revulsion and shock at this tale of YHWH’s violent punishment of daughter/wife Jerusalem to a more complex assessment of its symbolic treatment of the city’s destruction. To be sure, nothing can dispel the tale’s unsettling violence; nevertheless, it has become possible to appreciate how the narrative’s use of metaphor and gender allowed its ancient readers<br>

  Abstract: Hell posed problems that remained to worry the Enlightenment. It was a place where sin was punished with evils, and the evils were imposed by sinners whose punishment included imposing these evils. Post-Reformation hell posed a second problem: punishment that was essentially sinless, or that rested only on the Original Sin. When everyone sinned, there was no sin-directed punishment in hell. Hell was essentially punishment, imposed on those designated sinners who had been denied grace. It was not, however, merely the absence of God; it was vividly burning forever in a fiery furnace.<br>

The first known human experience of exile, the story of Sinuhe (documented on an Egyptian papyrus), dates back to 2000 BC (Tabori, 43). The limited social mobility, settled way of life, and minimal knowledge of the “other” in geographical and cultural terms in early societies meant that physical expulsion from the homeland was one of the most severe forms of punishment, almost equivalent to death.¹ Exile is connected to a range of other important signifiers: separation, loss, alienation, loneliness, and nostalgia.

In the second scene, the theme of retribution (punishment) surfaces as the inexorable response to his desecration. Both the crime and punishment of Fyodor, in the poetics of Dostoevsky, belong to the realm of “bezobrazie (the morally and esthetically “monstrous” or “shapeless”) and involve the disfiguration of man made in the image and likeness of God.<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir d~<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

  Abstract: One of the most powerful words in the English language, "corruption" is also one of the most troubled concepts in law. According to Laura Underkuffler, it is a concept based on religiously revealed ideas of good and evil. But the notion of corruption defies the ordinary categories by which law defines crimes-categories that punish acts, not character, and that eschew punishment on the basis of religion and emotion. Drawing on contemporary examples-including former assemblywoman Diane Gordon and former governor Rod Blagojevich-Underkuffler explores the implications and dangers of maintaining such an archaic concept at the heart of criminal law.<br>

  Author(s) Pranchère Jean-Yves<br>
  Abstract: Joseph de Maistre’s “Eclaircissement sur les Sacrifices” (1810)² is an unjustly neglected work of a most unjustly neglected author. Written concurrently with his masterwork
                     Les Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg,“Enlightenment on Sacrifices” provides a theoretical underpinning to Maistre’s notorious, often mysterious, and sometimes repellent reflections on punishment, war, the French Revolution, and the ways of Providence. The present essay outlines Maistre’s theory of sacrifice, describes how he applied it to historical events, processes, and institutions, and begins to explore the significance of Maistre’s theory for modern European intellectual history.<br>

  Abstract: When we return from resignation to the world of society, we turn to a certain tradition of justice and injustice, though the principles by which people attempt to derive laws from claims of reason often obscure the idea that justice itself may be a tradition. But what does it mean to say that there is a tradition of modern justice? And what are its insufficiencies? Kafka’s question might not even be posed in reference to justice but only in reference to punishment, which surely must be something different, even metaphorically. Our most banal and common metaphor of justice is the<br>

  Abstract: Since 9/11, the war on terror and the campaign for homeland security have increasingly mimicked the tactics of the enemies they sought to crush. Violence and punishment as both a media spectacle and a bone-crushing reality have become prominent and influential forces shaping American society. As the boundaries between “the realms of war and civil life have collapsed,” social relations and the public services needed to make them viable have been increasingly privatized and militarized.¹ The logic of profitability works its magic in channeling the public funding of warfare and organized violence into universities, market-based service providers, Hollywood cinema, cable<br>

  Abstract: Several factors converged in the 1770s to bolster interest among Dissenters in their own history. First, in 1767 the long, wearying legal battle between the City of London Corporation and the Protestant Dissenting Deputies came to end when six out of seven Law Lords decided in favour of the Dissenting position.¹ By Lord Mansfield’s judgment, Dissent was legally secured. Dissenting religious worship was, he said, ‘not only exempted from punishment, but rendered innocent and lawful: it is established, it is put under the protection, and is not merely under the connivance of the law’.²<br>

  Abstract: What calls for punishment? In a country where rape, murder, mugging, drug wars, and corruption are rampant, the answer seems too self-evident to warrant the question. Crime calls for punishment: to protect the innocent against the criminal in the future, to deter others inclined to crime, to enforce the standard of responsibility upon which civilized social relations rest, to vindicate the conception of justice through which most people live, and, though less often today, to rehabilitate the offender. Of course, these five sources (protection, deterrence, responsibility, justice, and rehabilitation) do not mesh well together. We disagree within and among ourselves<br>

  Abstract: Behaviorism understands cognitive learning as a cumulative process of forming associations based on the perception of contingencies, and normative learning as a process of adopting desired modes of behavior in response to punishment and reward (that is, as a process of conditioning). From a psychoanalytic perspective, development is a matter of constructing mental patterns on the basis of the relationships experienced in early childhood. Norms are observed because the child wishes to avoid pangs of conscience (i.e., the revenge of the superego, which internalizes the fear of castration); alternatively, this occurs because the structure of biological needs has undergone change<br>

Abstract: The heart of this book is Steffen’s defense of the Just Theory of Execution, a theory which combines elements found in the standard positions. Steffen allows that capital punishment would be just if it met nine conditions he lists, but he insists that these criteria cannot be met. For example, just execution can only be a last resort. But incarcerated murderers are no threat, so execution cannot be a last resort. Capital punishment does not meet this criterion.<br>

Abstract: In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, at a time when the idea of eternal punishment loses ground in dogmatic theology, divines insist on keeping it as a tool for the maintenance of moral and social order. See Daniel Pickering Walker,
            The Decline of Hell: Seventeenth‐Century Discussions of Eternal Torment(Chicago, 1964). Something analogous took place for the resurrection. As Bunyan warned, “he that denyeth the Resurrection of the dead, he setteth open a Floud‐gate to all manner of impiety, he cutteth the throat of a truly holy life, and layeth the Reins upon the neck of the most outragious lusts” (Bunyan,The Resurrection of the Dead,p. 214).<br>

Abstract: A critical analysis of the Vatican II document on freedom of religion brought me to the conclusion that people are indeed free in their choice of a religion, but this freedom, at least for Catholics, ceases once they have accepted the faith. Then only obedience to the institution representing the church’s doctrinal authority counts. Whoever does not submit to this authority can expect some form of punishment, for example, a reprimand, a warning, denial of the sacraments (which seems to be the case in the United States in 2004 with John Kerry, the Catholic presidential candidate, who is in favor of prudential abortion laws and stem cell research), compulsory public recantation, suspension, expulsion from office, laicization, and excommunication. Thus it is often stated in defense of the church—at least the Catholic Church—that it is a case of the “right of truth” versus the “right of the person” and that the latter is obviously subordinate to the former.
            29But if one is to avoid lapsing into personifying abstractions, the right of truth is tantamount to the right, hence the power, of a particular group to dictate to others what the truth is, so the right of the person is set up in opposition to the right of the group, here the church’s doctrinal authority.30<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, in contrast, is one of a few philosophers who offer, however briefly, a phenomenology of forgetting, although he too voices skepticism about an
         ars oblivionalison par with thears memoriae.He distinguishes between three levels or approaches to memory and forgetting. These are obstructed memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire empêchée,on the level of the psychopathological), manipulated memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire manipulée,on the practical or instrumental level), and controlled memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire commandée/obligée,on the ethical‐political level).110In the last context, forgetting and pardoning are intrinsically linked through the problematic of the past: forgetting, to memory and fidelity to the past; pardoning, to culpability and reconciliation with the past. “Indeed, a happy forgetting is the horizon of the pacified memory.”111Ricoeur further differentiates between forgetting through deletion and a more measured, reserved kind of forgetting, closely connected to the opposition between amnesia and amnesty. In considering amnesty as institutional forgetting, Ricoeur notes that it aims at reconciliation and civil peace.112In this sense one can hypothesize by analogy that persecution, punishment, and eradication, even if explicitly articulated as forgetting, may serve as institutional reminders but can also (sometimes consciously) exacerbate societal tensions.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: While in Mormon theology there is no existence without agency, the agency that operates in this world is conditioned by the gift of the atonement of Jesus Christ.

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: As for Sura 9, it is saturated with strictures and parables about fighting. We have examined already the complex instructions about oaths in Sura 9, but other verses explain why one should fight, whom one should fight, and the punishments for the reluctant and for those who disbelieve. For instance, promises of everlasting rewards are made to those who fight (9:19–22, 38–39, 111–12), while the reluctant are promised punishment (9:81–89). People of the book who do not accept God and the Last Day are promised punishment in hell (9:21–35), but Muslims are to spare them if they pay the protective tax in submission (9:29). Fighters who disbelieve are to suffer defeat by invisible forces sent from above, remembered from the battle at Hunain (9:25–26). Hypocrites who are frivolous may be pardoned, but hypocrites who deliberately sin are to be punished in hell, as covenant breakers with God (9:73–80). At the same time, women (9:87), the old, the ill, and those without means (9:91) are not required to fight, and the deterrent effect of fighting alongside the reluctant is also recognized (9:45–46; cf. Deut. 20:8).<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 671448<br>
Date: 10 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Feder Yitzhaq<br>
Abstract: It should be stressed, however, that the biblical treatment of pollution in all of its heterogeneity captures a richness of embodied experience which cannot be adequately represented in a schematic chart. In particular, it is not possible to determine a priority between the experiential schema and the emotion evoked by it. As noted above, emotional response is an inherent part of the perception of contagion.
      
               Furthermore, some sources of pollution do not conform so neatly to this analytic framework. In particular, though menstrual and puerperal blood are normal discharges, they had implications even outside the sacral sphere, namely in the strict ban on sexual relations.100
            
               Since sex with a menstruant involves the violation of the acceptable norms of conduct, being listed together with abominable sexual acts such as bestiality and incest, and entails divine punishment (Leviticus 18:19, 20:18), it fits the stain-of-transgression model in this regard. The severe ramifications entailed in the case of sex with a menstruant apparently stems from the extreme repulsion felt towards this behavior.101
            
               But rather than contradicting the existence of distinct types suggested above, this case should serve as a reminder that the various types of pollution are ultimately derived from attitudes towards the body in all of its multifarious possibilities—not from a rigid disembodied logic.102<br>

Abstract: Some of the earliest forms of the generic notion of evil demarcate
            abominations—acts that, like incest, cannibalism, patricide—elicit horror and disgust. Abominations are violations, disorders of nature that issue in natural sanctions: plagues or expulsions. The world in whichevilis construed as a form ofsinful disobedienceis a world defined by a divinity who gives commands, exacts obedience, punishes, or rewards (Genesis and Exodus). A world focused on virtue andviceis a naturalistic, social world (Theophrastus, Butler, Mandeville). Virtues are those traits that—like courage and justice—preserve and enhance a community. The vices—greed, disloyalty, envy, self-indulgence, disrespect—threaten the social order. The origins and sanctions for vices are social: an unfortunate upbringing in a malformed polity can issue in the kind of corruption whose sanction is the loss of trust and cooperation. Withmalevolence(Pope Innocent III, Calvin), we enter a new world, a world of individual will and responsibility. While malevolence is normally marked by a defective will,sinfuses disobedience with a defiant will (Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards). But while the earliest forms of disobedience can be relatively innocent, sin presupposes that Everyman, in the full knowledge of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, willfully violates the divine order by presumptuous pride (Milton’s Satan, Goethe’s Faust). When the disposition or proclivity to sin—construed as pride or egoism—becomes an inherently dominant and psychologically structuring motive, only divine grace can set aside divine punishment. Evil becomes less fraught when morality returns to the secular, social order during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Setting aside the theology and metaphysics of sin, the new psychology turned to characterizing character traits that—like wanton cruelty—generate “man’s inhumanity to man” (Montaigne, Voltaire).Partiality, egoism—the desire for glory or selfinterest—remai~<br>

Abstract: Exploring this question brings us to one of the great cruxes of the poem—the justice of the serpent’s punishment. The Son says two seemingly contradictory things, telling the Father that “conviction to the serpent none belongs” but describing him to Adam and Eve as “justly then accurst / As vitiated in nature” (10.84, 10.168–69). Obviously aware of the inconsistency, Milton assures us that “More to know / Concerned not Man” (10.169–70). But in inscribing this uncertainty so prominently into his poem, Milton virtually assures that we will seek to know more, whether it concerns us or not. And while he does not provide an answer to the question, Milton does indicate, I believe, the single fine point around which the debate must turn. When the serpentine Satan first prepares to address Eve, we are told:<br>

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Figurative language may not be a primary means of conveying painful sensation, but it is paramount in assigning significance to those sensations and affecting audience reactions to its portrayal—perhaps even coercing them into an interpretation they would otherwise reject. In the artistic and theatrical exploration of human suffering, metaphors and pain are intimately linked because it is this interpretive trope that cues audience response and assigns meaning to an otherwise horrifyingly senseless bodily experience. The figures of pain discussed here attest to the artistry of these playwrights, but also to the power of metaphor and other tropes to shape the thinking of an entire culture. As Wayne C. Booth writes of metaphor’s role in community discourse, “The metaphors we care for most are always embedded in metaphoric structures that finally both depend on and constitute selves and societies.”
   
            Early modern culture utilized numerous discourses to make sense of pain, from seeing it as a sign of devotion in the Petrarchan lover or religious martyr to construing it as evidence of guilt in systems of corporal or capital punishment. Early modern tragic theater draws on those cultural narratives, but it also serves as a space for practicing the types of interpretation needed to make sense of pain—an understanding that extended outward at the close of the play. By being attentive to the moments of spectacular suffering that define these plays, by noting the philosophical and affective purposes those spectacles serve, we can see at work the same systems of interpretation that made possible many early modern cultural discourses, from the literary to the judicial to the spiritual. Far from being irreconcilable, pain and metaphor work in conjunction in early modern tragedy to create a durable interpretive community out of a single, yet multifaceted, physical experience.51<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23019993<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Rothchild Jonathan<br>
Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Abstract: Finke, pp. 41-42: "In the Middle Ages, torture was not regarded simply as a form of
punishment. It was, as Foucault has shown, a technique and a ritual, a semiotic system which 'must
mark the victim.' Torture inscribed on the victim's body the 'signs' of the ruler's power. It was
one of the most visible displays of that power, an art, 'an entire poetic' that competed with other
visual displays of theocratic rule. The marking of the victim's body signifies the power that
punishes. "In the 'excesses' of torture, a whole economy of power is invested". In her excesses,
the mystic becomes at once both torturer and victim. This, it seems to me, is the whole point. The
mystic's pain - her inflicting of wounds upon herself — grants her the authority to speak and be
heard."<br>

Abstract: David Carrithers argues that crimes are 'matters of conscious choice' for
Montesquieu, and adduces passages from Letter 83 as evidence. See David W.
Carrithers, 'Montesquieu's Philosophy of Punishment', History of Political Thought,
XIX ( 1998), pp. 213^10, p. 219. Carrithers acknowledges Montesquieu' s statement that
self-interest is always a 'determining cause' of unjust actions; but Montesquieu's
position in the Persian Letters seems to be that self-interested actions are not always
chosen with a range of options clearly in view. See also Mason, Montesquieu's Idea of
Justice, p. 150; Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, Part 1, Bk. 1.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics. To begin with, Ricoeurs initial contact with the problematic of psychoanalysis in La symbolique du mal will be treated. Secondly, considering Essai sur Freud, the article endeavors to place psychoanalysis as an archeology of the subject to be conjugated with teleological (Hegel) and eschatological (philosophy ~<br>

Abstract: Moving from repression or tyranny toward the rule of law and reason is fraught with difficulties. One question of transitional justice is whether those responsible for the horrors of the previous régime should be punished or whether those involved in the transition should travel a path toward forgiveness and unity. Within this article, it is urged that in the (re-)establishment of the rule of reason among all involved there is a commitment to peace as opposed to force. This commitment marks retribution and utilitarian punishment as incoherent and normatively indefensible. Resorting to punishment is the abandonment of reason, not its reinstatement. Indeed, the point can be generalized. Punishment, as resorting to force, is a move away from establishing or sustaining a framework of justification and its commitment to peace.<br>

Abstract: L'analyse lexicométrique des réponses à une question ouverte posée le lendemain de la mort de Fr. Mitterrand permet de mettre en évidence le champ des représentations sociales, qui forment à ce moment particulier l'image de l'ancien président. Au-delà du discours consensuel imposé par les circonstances, il est possible de mettre à jour des différences dans l'usage des stéréotypes. Les variables classiques de la sociologie politique déterminent des représentations différentes du porte-parole: l'abolition de la peine de mort, les 39 heures, la 5e semaine de congés payés, le Grand Louvre sont diversement associés au défunt président. De la même manière, les citations sélectives de caractéristiques psychologiques comme l'intelligence, la culture ou la simplicité sont le produit de logiques sociales. On peut aussi montrer que les représentations, en tant que lieux communs, constituent des « lieux de mémoire » et sont structurées par des logiques symboliques. L'image ainsi comprise « stocke », organise et condense cognitions et affects liés aux dimensions individuelles et collectives, privées et publiques, d'un porte-parole. A lexicometric analysis of answers to an open question asked the day after François Mitterrand's death clarifies the field of the social representations which then made up the former president's image. Beyond the consensual discourse imposed by circumstances, there were differences in the use of stereotypes. The classic variables of political sociology determine different representations of the leader : the abolition of capital punishment, the 39-hour work week, the fifth week of paid vacations, and the Grand Louvre are variously associated with the late former president. Similarly, references to psychological characteristics such as intelligence, culture or simplicity are the results of social logics. It can also be shown that representations as common places make up « sites » and are structured by symbolic logics. The image thus understood « stocks ~<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Abstract: The three-drug protocol is designed to circumvent the very possibility of establishing whether or not the condemned person is suffering or in pain, whether or not he or she is conscious at the moment of death, and therefore whether or not the punishment is cruel and unusual as defined by the Court. Furthermore, this fabulous fantasy of painless death disavows the reality that we don't know how to define what constitutes consciousness of death because firsthand testimony is impossible. As long as Lawrence Brewer, recently executed in Texas, goes out snoring as if in a sound sleep (which he apparently did), at some level we can reassure ourselves that his death is the least cruel, most usual, and perhaps even the most desired, namely, dying in his sleep.<br>

Abstract: Well, then, why was Shaw so indomitable? What accounts for his steely intestinal fortitude and his exceptional recuperative power? Shaw could have retired from the fray gracefully, and with earned distinction, but he chose not to. Where most would have strategically advanced to the rear, he charged forward; and when many would have raised the white flag, he persevered. What was it that gave the psychically wounded Shaw the strength to continue plying his trade, in and out of the playhouse, for a flawed species adrift in a world teetering on the edge of annihilation? Was he an egomaniac? Was he an obsessive-compulsive? Was it merely a matter of keeping a stiff upper lip or putting a smiley face on a blighted situation? Was he a diehard lover of lost causes? Was he delusional? Was he a camouflaged Pollyanna in a Jaeger suit? Was he a glutton for punishment? No: I do not think it was any of these things. I believe—along the lines suggested previously—a more satisfactory answer to the intriguing question of Shaw's remarkable endurance is available to us.<br>
