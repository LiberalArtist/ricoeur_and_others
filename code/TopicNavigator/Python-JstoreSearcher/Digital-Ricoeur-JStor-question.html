  Abstract: The question of what makes a Jesuit, the
                  quidditas jesuitica, is thrown into stark relief by the extraordinary case of Diego de Alfaro (d.1639) and its apologia, written in 1644 by the former provincial of the Paraguayan province, Diego de Boroa (d.1657).² Alfaro—superior of the missions of Guairá in the province of Paraguay—took up arms in 1639 and fought alongside his Guarani faithful againstbandeirantes(slave raiders) from the Portuguese city of São Paulo; in the gunfight with these slavers, Alfaro was killed.

  Book Title: Mourning Animals-Rituals and Practices Surrounding Animal Death<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kalof Linda<br>
  Abstract: We live more intimately with nonhuman animals than ever before in history. The change in the way we cohabitate with animals can be seen in the way we treat them when they die. There is an almost infinite variety of ways to help us cope with the loss of our nonhuman friends-from burial, cremation, and taxidermy; to wearing or displaying the remains (ashes, fur, or other parts) of our deceased animals in jewelry, tattoos, or other artwork; to counselors who specialize in helping people mourn pets; to classes for veterinarians; to tips to help the surviving animals who are grieving their animal friends; to pet psychics and memorial websites. But the reality is that these practices, and related beliefs about animal souls or animal afterlife, generally only extend, with very few exceptions, to certain kinds of animals-pets. Most animals, in most cultures, are not mourned, and the question of an animal afterlife is not contemplated at all.
      Mourning Animalsinvestigates how we mourn animal deaths, which animals are grievable, and what the implications are for all animals.<br>

  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: The question of whether or not humans mourn animals is present in all of my photographic work. This theme emerged in my art when I began looking closely at dead animals and making images of roadkill animals, photographing flower and stone memorials I built around their bodies. My recent project, “Another Death,” portrays museum taxidermic animals that have suffered another kind of death after their initial demise. Frozen in time, they are presented either in the throes of death at another creature’s hand or in a limp resting pose, having just passed. Moments like these appear frequently in natural history<br>

  Abstract: The question posed for this panel is both new and old. In the context of our own lives and careers, it is something new to question the nature and role of theory in our work. As Jo Sprague said, in her letter attempting to orient today’s speakers, not so long ago we were quite confident that we knew what theory was and how to use it as teachers. Theory, on this view, was something that stood apart from and above practice.

  Abstract: In 1919, Raymond Crist, the director of citizenship in the Bureau of Naturalization, appeared before a House committee hearing on proposed changes to naturalization laws. In his opening statement, Crist suggested that the true import of his testimony was to praise the recent education initiatives of Americanization: “There is, however, a far greater subject which I should like to present to the committee for its most careful consideration. That subject is the all-absorbing, Nation-wide question rather loosely referred to by the term ‘Americanization.’”¹ For Crist, effective Americanization altered the hearts and minds of the unnaturalized.

Replicating and augmenting the transferential setting of the detective story, these changes radicalize its questions: What is the ultimate source of the contagion that has transformed Santa Varvara into a city of wolves? Can infected individuals be cured, or will they always be wolves? “Capriccio” investigates the possibility ofreversible metamorphoses:Can those who have been contaminated by the wolves grasp their humanity again and break free of mimesis-driven scapegoating? Addressing this question are Stephanie, by means of her diary, and Kristeva,<br>

  Abstract: The intifada dramatically influenced the Palestinian symbol system. Writing in 1989, Rashid Khalidi observed that the intifada had created a “strong sense of national unity, of loyalty to a unified set of symbols and concepts and of mutual independence which were lacking in 1967.”¹ Without question, the engine of Palestinian symbol transformation was the intifada. The intifada, in turn, helped make possible the Oslo agreement, which led to Yasir Arafat’s return to Gaza in July 1994 and the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.<br>

Clearly, not all subjects are deemed historical at all times—that much has been clear from the beginnings of the discipline. What is required, then, for a particular object to become a proper subject of history? And what are the implications of such constraints for the history that is being written?

This compound dis/plays the juxtaposition of life and time so elemental to our way of being in the world: what most impresses our thinking about the life-that-is-passing is the passing-that-is-life, a passing that lies at the root of our rootlessness.

  Abstract: By the middle of the twentieth century, the critical question concerning Canto VI was no longer one of historical identification or aesthetic appreciation, but of whether the canto was substantially unified or, instead, contained a series of poetically unresolved issues. Aurelio Roncaglia, in his “Lectura Dantis” of 1955, showed that the repetition of disjunctive verbs such as
                  si parte(“is done,” 1),disgiunto(“without a passageway,” 42),non m’accompagne(“not at my side,” 114), andscisso(“dissevered,” 123) creates a “convulsive marker” connecting the various parts of the canto.

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters I showed that Evangelical religious practice can fit into projects of self-reform among poor Caracas men. But I am yet to address the most difficult question: how can people intentionally adopt a set of religious beliefs and practices in order to confront life problems? The tradition of thought that defines religion and culture in contradistinction to individual rationalistic action can be traced to Durkheim if not earlier. But despite this long-term conceptual trend, the incompatibility of intention and belief has been built on as a presupposition, not established through argument. One exception is the political philosopher<br>

  Book Title: The Maternal Factor-Two Paths to Morality<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Noddings Nel<br>
  Abstract: In this provocative new book, renowned educator and philosopher Nel Noddings extends her influential work on the ethics of care toward a compelling objective—global peace and justice. She asks: If we celebrate the success of women becoming more like men in professional life, should we not simultaneously hope that men become more like women—in caring for others, rejecting violence, and valuing the work of caring both publicly and personally? Drawing on current work on evolution, and bringing concrete examples from women’s lived experience to make a strong case for her position, Noddings answers this question by locating one source of morality in maternal instinct. She traces the development of the maternal instinct to natural caring and ethical caring, offering a preliminary sketch of what a care-driven concept of justice might look like. Finally, to advance the cause of caring, peace, and women’s advancement, Noddings urges women to abandon institutional, patriarchal religion and to seek their own paths to spirituality.<br>

  Book Title: Gadamer’s Repercussions-Reconsidering Philosophical Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Krajewski Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Certainly one of the key German philosophers of the twentieth century, Hans-Georg Gadamer also influenced the study of literature, art, music, sacred and legal texts, and medicine. Indeed, while much attention has been focused on Gadamer's writings about ancient Greek and modern German philosophy, the relevance of his work for other disciplines is only now beginning to be properly considered and understood. In an effort to address this slant, this volume brings together many prominent scholars to assess, re-evaluate, and question Hans-Georg Gadamer's works, as well as his place in intellectual history. The book includes a recent essay by Gadamer on "the task of hermeneutics," as well as essays by distinguished contributors including Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, Gerald Bruns, Georgia Warnke, and many others. The contributors situate Gadamer's views in surprising ways and show that his writings speak to a range of contemporary debates—from constitutional questions to issues of modern art. A controversial final section attempts to uncover and clarify Gadamer's history in relation to National Socialism. More an investigation and questioning than a celebration of this venerable and profoundly influential philosopher, this collection will become a catalyst for any future rethinking of philosophical hermeneutics, as well as a significant starting place for rereading and reviewing Hans-Georg Gadamer.<br>

  Abstract: In a book called
                     Reason in the Age of Science,Hans-Georg Gadamer asked the question: Can “philosophy” refer to anything nowadays except the theory of science?¹ His own answer to this question is affirmative. It may seem that the so-called “analytic” tradition in philosophy—the tradition that goes back to Frege and Russell and whose most prominent living representatives are Quine, Davidson, Dummett, and Putnam—must return a negative answer. For that tradition is often thought of as a sort of public relations agency for the natural sciences.<br>

A first answer, given by Aristotle himself, posits a rigid material body in place by virtue of its sheer contiguity with the inner surface of what immediately surrounds it—a strictly physical intimacy that works by close containment.

Now, however, student teachers and teachers are advantaged — and consequently, should be reassured — by an emerging amount of research showing how the teaching of historical literacy through historical novels can be achieved.

Can there be maintained identity between New Testament teachings and later doctrinal formulations that utilize very different conceptual frameworks? Most importantly, if doctrines do in fact develop over time through expansion, contextualization, and critical correction, how can the faith communities that develop and reformulate doctrines claim to be part of the same broad Christian tradition?<br>

  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Abstract: The debate about the relevance of biology for ethics dates back to the time of Aristotle. In premodern theologies, nature and personhood have mainly been considered as two complementary notions. On the one hand, the human person was presented as a unique realization of nature; on the other, the human person fulfilled the assumptions that nature had given to him or her by virtue of his or her free will and the possibility for free choice. In other words, nature opens the possibility for free and responsible action. Since Darwin’s

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

Instead, I want to turn to the question of justice (the preoccupation of the Hebrew Bible), for the infusion of this ethical concern is vital: political life must be lived under the horizon of justice.

But it is also, in the second instance, a question for Levinas, concerning the potential of autobiography to represent an alterity perhaps not fully accounted for by his philosophy. This double question presides over the reflection that follows.<br>

  Abstract: One of the generative questions in Benjamin Nelson’s late work was: What accounts for the breakthrough insights that permit the reduction of all quality to quantity, the proclaiming of a mathematical reality behind the experiential immediacies of experience and the affirmation of a homogeneous time and space throughout the universe, insights that characterize Western science? It is a question that exercise both Nelson and Joseph Needham; both consider it from an intercivilizational perspective.

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

Historically, however, this is a real question, and one bearing on faith and ideology.

  Book Title: The Experience of God: A Postmodern Response-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: The book provides a series of approaches to the ancient question of whether and how God is a matter of experience,or, alternately, to what extent the notion of experience can be true to itself if it does not include God. On the one hand, it seems impossible to experience God: the deity does not offer Himself to sense experience. On the other hand, there have been mystics who have claimed to have encountered God. The essays in this collection seek to explore the topic again, drawing insights from phenomenology, theology, literature, and feminism. Throughout, this stimulating collection maintains a strong connection with concrete rather than abstract approaches to God.The contributors: Michael F. Andrews, Jeffrey Bloechl, John D. Caputo, Kristine Culp, Kevin Hart, Kevin L. Hughes, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Crystal Lucky, Renee McKenzie, Kim Paffenroth, Michael Purcell, Michael J. Scanlon, O.S.A., James K. A. Smith.

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

It is critical, then, to avoid the danger of the confusion resulting from “badly put or badly analyzed problems.” Philosophy, or at least its significance, stands or falls with the problems it is capable of setting up.

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Book Title: Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clift Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Whereas historical determinacy conceives the past as a complex and unstable network of causalities, this book asks how history can be related to a more radical future. To pose that question, it does not reject determinacy outright but rather seeks to explore how it works. In examining what it means to be "determined" by history, it also asks what kind of openings there might be in our encounters with history for interruptions, re-readings, and re-writings. Engaging texts spanning multiple genres and several centuries from John Locke to Maurice Blanchot, from Hegel to Benjamin Clift looks at experiences of time that exceed the historical narration of experiences said to have occurred in time. She focuses on the co-existence of multiple temporalities and opens up the quintessentially modern notion of historical succession to other possibilities. The alternatives she draws out include the mediations of language and narration, temporal leaps, oscillations and blockages, and the role played by contingency in representation. She argues that such alternatives compel us to reassess the ways we understand history and identity in a traumatic, or indeed in a post-traumatic, age.<br>

  Abstract: As we saw in Chapter 1, one of the achievements of Arendt’s and Benjamin’s critiques of history is to have drawn attention to the ways in which modern history effectively eliminates the dimension of human experience from its discursive structure. The question remains, though, as to how to situate the concept of experience with respect to this devaluation, especially given that one of the single most important innovations of modern philosophy was to have grounded knowledge in experience itself. In short: If modern history all but eliminates experience from its discourse, it is no less the case that the modern<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

  Abstract: In these lines from Vladimir Mayakovsky’s revolutionary poem 150,000,000 (1919/20), revolutionary action is linked to the demand for a “new myth”; out of them arises the question of the extent to which revolution can be mythicized, the relation of the old myth to the new, and the function of poetry in the creation of new myths. A full discussion of these questions, either in general or in relation to Mayakovsky’s poetry, would be far beyond the scope of this essay, but we shall attempt to provide a basis for such discussion by outlining certain facets of the subject, with concrete<br>

  Abstract: Josiah Royce suggests a strategy for breaking away from vistas that are narrow, limiting, and fragmenting. With his aid we can come to a position which gives a clear overview of America, that territory whose mapped extent—geographical and psychological—is crucial to the question of how far we may succeed or by how much we are lacking. When we say that the sun rises and sets, Royce observes in

  Book Title: Value and Values-Economics and Justice in an Age of Global Interdependence<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: Especially in the aftermath of what is now being called the Great Recession, awareness has mounted of the imperative to question the modern divorce of economics from ethics. While the domains of economics and ethics were from antiquity through at least the eighteenth century understood in many cultures to be coterminous and mutually entailing, the modern assumption has been that the goal of maximizing human prosperity and the aim of justly enhancing our lives as persons and as communities were functionally and practically distinct. Working from a wide array of perspectives, the contributors to this volume offer a set of challenges to the assumed independence of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of human and planetary well-being. Reflecting on the complex interrelationship among economics, justice, and equity, the book resists "one size fits all" approaches and struggles to revitalize the marriage of economics and ethics by activating cultural differences as the basis of mutual contribution to shared human flourishing. The publication of this important collection will stimulate or extend critical debates among scholars and students working in a number of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including philosophy, history, environmental studies, economics, and law.<br>

  Abstract: “Social justice” is a phrase that recurs with some force in contemporary political and academic discussion, and in many respects this is understandable. One can scarcely imagine a form of human life for which justice does not remain a question, and the effects of the adjective point up the particular pressures to which that question is exposed in an overcrowded and, in some ways, environmentally depleted world. How are we to live together in justice, in our own countries and continents, and in the world as a whole?<br>

  Book Title: The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Maas Sander<br>
  Abstract: Present-day music studies conspicuously evade the question of religion in contemporary music. Although many composers address the issue in their work, as yet there have been few attempts to think through the structure of religious music as we hear it. On the basis of a careful analysis of Olivier Messiaen's work, this book argues for a renewal of our thinking about religious music. Addressing his notion of a hyper-religiousmusic of sounds and colors, it aims to show that Messiaen has broken new ground. His reinvention of religious music makes us again aware of the fact that religious music, if taken in its proper radical sense, belongs to the foremost of musical adventures.The work of Olivier Messiaen is well known for its inclusion of religious themes and gestures. These alone, however, do not seem enough to account for the religious status of the work. Arguing for a breakthrough toward the beyondon the basis of the synaesthetic experience of music, Messiaen invites a confrontation with contemporary theologians and post-secular thinkers. How to account for a religious breakthrough that is produced by a work of art?Starting from an analysis of his 1960s oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur Jsus-Christ, this book arranges a moderated dialogue between Messiaen and the music theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the phenomenology of revelation of Jean-Luc Marion, the rethinking of religion and technics in Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, and the Augustinian ruminations of Sren Kierkegaard and Jean-Franois Lyotard. Ultimately, this confrontation underscores the challenging yet deeply affirmative nature of Messiaen's music.<br>

Now it is time to turn to the question of how he endeavored to realize these possibilities. What does it look like in practice, this “glistening music” of soundcolor, dazzlement, and breakthrough? How does Messiaen actually compose this music of
                  éblouissement? What is it that makes music and religion relate so intimately to one another? Several levels come into view. What chords and colors exactly come into play? How does Messiaen use them? Are there perhaps any other musical<br>

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

  Abstract: Truth and reconciliation commissions are often claimed to be more victim-friendly than criminal trials. Indeed, being cross-examined by Slobodan Milosovic or simply being exposed to the intrinsic harshness of the adversarial criminal justice process is not likely to be “healing” to participating victims. In criminal courts, victims’ testimony is constantly cut short, and they are asked to focus on the forensic details. Indeed, the main reason for their presence in court is not to tell their story and have it validated publicly, but rather to provide a piece of the evidence in relation to which the question of the guilt<br>

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors.

The justification rests ultimately on the body. If present-day humans can approximate to the point of view of their hominid ancestors, then explicit corporeal grounds exist for affirming that approximation. Tactile–kinesthetic invariants obviously provide the strongest and most direct way of demonstrating those grounds. Rather than taking up these invariants straightaway, however, a more circuitous epistemological route will be followed, and this in order to demonstrate how<br>

  Author(s) Loughlin Gerard<br>
  Abstract: What is scripture?¹ Wilfred Cantwell Smith challenges us to pause and ponder this question. All religious traditions that ground themselves in texts must grapple with certain questions. In worship services and public and private readings, Christians often turn to scripture for guidance: to the stories of Abraham or Moses, to the Psalms, to the prophecies of Isaiah, to the life of Jesus, to the letters of Paul, to the vision of John. Therefore, Christians must confront their own set of questions. Indeed, to ask the question, what is scripture? is to become mired in a muddy pool of questions: What<br>

  Abstract: Jesus answers the high priest’s question about his true identity with the words

They have responded to the pressures of the financial markets by carrying out draconian measures to bring their national accounts under control. The magnitude of the adjustments made to avert the prospect of a default has peremptorily brought onto the agenda of many European countries the question of whether the sacrifices imposed on their respective societies have been fairly distributed among all citizens.

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

  Abstract: Few philosophers have devoted such sustained, almost obsessive attention to the topic of death as Søren Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard and Death brings together new work on Kierkegaard's multifaceted discussions of death and provides a thorough guide to the development, in various texts and contexts, of Kierkegaard's ideas concerning death. Essays by an international group of scholars take up essential topics such as dying to the world, living death, immortality, suicide, mortality and subjectivity, death and the meaning of life, remembrance of the dead, and the question of the afterlife. While bringing Kierkegaard's philosophy of death into focus, this volume connects Kierkegaard with important debates in contemporary philosophy.<br>

To argue for the compatibility of philosophy, feminism, and faith, then, is not a mathematical sort of task—one that can be completed to the satisfaction of some professionally constituted public.

  Author(s): Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: Harnessing the energy of provocative theories generated by recent understandings of the human body, the natural world, and the material world, Material Feminisms presents an entirely new way for feminists to conceive of the question of materiality. In lively and timely essays, an international group of feminist thinkers challenges the assumptions and norms that have previously defined studies about the body. These wide-ranging essays grapple with topics such as the material reality of race, the significance of sexual difference, the impact of disability experience, and the complex interaction between nature and culture in traumatic events such as Hurricane Katrina. By insisting on the importance of materiality, this volume breaks new ground in philosophy, feminist theory, cultural studies, science studies, and other fields where the body and nature collide.<br>

His philosophical writings argue for this new subjectivity, but the question of how this subjectivity can develop begs for an answer. His writings on Jewish education provide some direction.

  Abstract: I would like to focus in my chapter on the question of creativity, which after long neglect in literary and cultural studies is reemerging on the agenda of scholarship, especially within recent directions of ecocriticism. For a long time, the concept of creativity appeared to be inextricably bound up with a notion of radical individualism and of the quasi-godlike creative genius of the human mind, which seemed to represent a classic case of an anthropocentric metaphysics. In ecocritical perspective, however, creativity is beginning to newly move into the focus of attention not alone as an exclusionary feature of human culture<br>

  Abstract: Max Picard’s notion of Silence,¹ Martin Heidegger’s notion of Being,² and Martin Buber’s notion of the Between³ are not identical notions; but these three, I would suggest, stem from the same region of experience. It is a region whose loss all three thinkers bemoan as the ground of our modem unrest and rootlessness, for we are no longer planted in the soil, the relational context that is our proper element as human beings. When one thinks of rootedness, one thinks of family or of tradition, and, as significant regions of relatedness, these are not unrelated to the notions in question.<br>

  Abstract: Is it an irony of modern theology that in the age in which Rudolph Bultmann should raise the question of the fundamentally mythological character of many New Testament ideas, Hans Urs von Balthasar should seek to reinvigorate the theological meaning of the descent of Christ into hell on Holy Saturday? Perhaps not. By offering a distinctive and in many ways innovative reading of this teaching of the Apostles’ Creed, Balthasar sought to challenge an age of overly reductive scientistic rationality, underscoring in Catholic theology the permanently valid interplay of literary symbolism, metaphysics, dramatic beauty, and Trinitarian mystery.

How this is defined or set out is usually bound up with the conceptualization of community itself.

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

  Book Title: Lex Crucis-Soteriology and the Stages of Meaning<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress, Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Loewe William P.<br>
  Abstract: What is the true story of God and humankind, and how does that story become a saving story? These are pivotal questions that constitute the narratives Christians tell about themselves, their values, and how the Christian life is to be lived. In shaping those stories into a coherent, intelligible framework that provides comprehensive meaning, soteriology—the doctrine of redemption—developed as a keystone to Christian consciousness. This study investigates that development of the soteriological tradition. Employing Bernard Lonergan’s notion of the stages of meaning as a hermeneutic, the volume traces the origins of soteriology in the early Christian tradition represented by Irenaeus to its establishment as a systematic theory in Anselm, Aquinas, and subsequent developments in the Protestant tradition of Luther and Schleiermacher. The author concludes with a constructive exploration of Lonergan’s own work on the question of soteriology that overcomes the modernist distortions that hinder Schleiermacher’s account and offers an articulation of the dynamics of Christian conversion that opens onto the social, cultural, and political mediations of redemption necessary for the contemporary age.<br>

  Book Title: Le roman français contemporain face à l’Histoire-Thèmes et formes<br>
  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Viart Dominique<br>
  Abstract: L’Histoire ne laisse pas la littérature en paix. Ou bien est-ce l’inverse? Depuis une trentaine d’années, une floraison de romans français revisitent le passé. Cette rétrospection concerne surtout le XXe siècle, ses phases cruciales et ses événements tragiques, mais elle embrasse aussi les époques antérieures. Les romanciers ne se satisfont plus de raconter : ils suspectent, ils enquêtent, multiplient leurs approches. Et leurs oeuvres diffèrent par bien des aspects, formels et thématiques, du roman historique en vogue au XIXe siècle. Dans le même temps, nombre d’historiens s’interrogent sur l’instance narrative, la forme du récit et sur les usages scientifiques de la fiction littéraire. À la confluence de ces mouvements se déploie la fortune de ce qu’on pourrait appeler des romans historiens, pour lesquels l’Histoire, les événements aussi bien que la manière de les écrire, devient elle-même une question partagée. Autour de ce grand courant historicisant qui accroît encore son élan dans la première décennie du XXIe siècle, le présent ouvrage réunit des réflexions d’écrivains, d’historiens, de littéraires. Attentif aux textes les plus récents, il en explore les choix chronologiques, les modèles formels, les thèmes saillants, parmi lesquels les guerres, la décolonisation et les questions politiques jouent un rôle de premier plan.<br>

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

  Book Title: Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Newmark Kevin<br>
  Abstract: What is it about irony--as an object of serious philosophical reflection and a literary technique of considerable elasticity--that makes it an occasion for endless critical debate? This book responds to this question by focusing on several key moments in German Romanticism and its afterlife in twentieth-century French thought and writing. It includes chapters on Friedrich Schlegel, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, and Paul de Man. A coda traces the way unresolved tensions inherited from Romanticism resurface in a novelist like J. M. Coetzee. But this book is neither a historical nor a thematic study of irony. To the degree that irony initiates a deflection of meaning, it also entails a divergence from historical and thematic models of understanding. The book therefore aims to respect irony's digressive force by allowing it to emerge from questions that sometimes have little or nothing to do with the ostensible topic of irony. For if irony is the possibility that whatever is being said does not coincide fully with whatever is being meant, then there is no guarantee that the most legitimate approach to the problem would proceed directly to those places where "irony" is named, described, or presumed to reside. Rather than providing a history of irony, then, this book examines particular occasions of ironic disruption. It thus offers an alternative model for conceiving of historical occurrences and their potential for acquiring meaning.<br>

The difficulties inherent in the question stem not so much from the absence of references to history and politics in his writing—on the contrary; it is a rare text by de Man that does not mention law, politics, economics, social unrest, war, or revolution.

Important for the Christian theologian is the question of how God impacts the self. Two texts of particular relevance to this proposed consideration of theological selfhood stand out. They provide tools for considering the concept of an ethically oriented self. Specifically, these texts present the concept of ethical selfhood not as the fruit of reflection on oneself, but as engagement with an “other” who encounters<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas’s writings are rich in comments and reflections on art, poetry, and the relations between poetry and ethical theory.¹ Of particular importance is the question of language, because there appears to be a kind of symmetry between language as an ethical relation and the language of poetry, both of which expose us to regions of subjectivity or existence on the hither (anarchic) side of cognition and being. The ethical and the poetic are evidently species of saying (

  Book Title: Provocations to Reading: J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come-J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kujundžić Dragan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J. Hillis Miller, one of the most eminent literary scholars in America. For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future. Barbara Cohen is Director of HumaniTech at the University of California, Irvine. She is co-editor of Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory. Dragan Kujunzic is Professor of Russian and Comparative Literature and Director of Russian Studies at the University of California, Irvine.

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

Historically, how the experiences are named determined the types of treatment that were deemed to be appropriate. The church has participated in this process, but laterally, the naming, framing and responding to those experiences have become the terrain of psychiatry. Psychiatry has a questionable history and has been the location for various political, economic, and professional power struggles as the discipline has developed and has sought to offer a rationale for its existence.<br>

  Book Title: Christian Theology and Religious Pluralism-A Critical Evaluation of John Hick<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nah David S.<br>
  Abstract: The question of religious pluralism is the most significant yet thorniest of issues in theology today, and John Hick (1922–2012) has long been recognized as its most important scholar. However, while much has been written analyzing the philosophical basis of Hick’s pluralism, very little attention has been devoted to the theological foundations of his argument. Filling this gap, this book examines Hick’s theological attempts to systematically deconstruct the church’s traditional incarnational Christology. Special attention is given to evaluating Hick’s foundational theses “that Jesus himself did not teach what was to become the orthodox Christian understanding of him" and “that the dogma of Jesus’ two natures . . . has proved to be incapable of being explicated in any satisfactory way." By elucidating the ways in which Hick’s arguments fail, David Nah demonstrates that Hick was unwarranted in breaking away from the church’s incarnational Christology that has been at the core of Christianity for almost two thousand years.<br>

In this sense, the Eucharist is not “rooted” in its history, but rather

  Abstract: ‘The main thrust of what I want to say is that translating the Bible is an art that we seem to have lost, for mysterious reasons.’ So said David Daniell, the distinguished Tyndale scholar, at a conference in London in February 1995. There has been, to my knowledge, no decisive answer offered to the question implied by his statement. Daniell himself points out some of the central paradoxes of this situation. The ‘we’ of his statement refers, of course, to the community of English-speakers, a language which ‘has never been in better shape … It is healthier than ever before,<br>

  Abstract: Man’s quest for wholeness matches his quest for origins both as an essential human desideratum and as a recurrent philosophical theme. Whereas in the last chapter we addressed the question of what it means to be a self, in this chapter we will address the question of what it might mean for a self to be whole. In what follows, I want first to consider the desire for wholeness as it gets expressed in terms of either a univocal or an equivocal sense of being. The former tends to yield a sense of wholeness in terms of simple self-identity, the<br>

That is why neither the expressivist, “constructive” self nor its “receptive” counterpart configured by the “outside” is ultimately able to convey the full dimension of this emergence. I have suggested here that a theological reply to this epistemological decision must question the more general framework of its theological assumptions.

However, there is a burgeoning group of philosophers and theologians who are advocating that theology might benefit from being more like analytic philosophy, at least, more like the analytic method. This most recent effort to encourage Christian theologians toward the analytic method was captured by the anthology

For our faith to have meaning it must be meaningful in a particular historical, cultural, and social context. The question of whether and how the meaning of the beliefs and practices of Christian faith can be translated into those that share the same truth in other cultures becomes acute. For the claims of Christian conviction to be true they must be commensurable. All this leads to an assertion: once the faith has been shared,<br>

The inseparability of the gifted unity of being from the question of time arose through the examination of the gratuity of the gift: the entryway to the meaning of being’s time and eternity.Pondering God’s own gratuity revealed that the tri-hypostatic being is one precisely because God is eternal, ever-fruitful beginning.

  Book Title: Allegorizing History-The Venerable Bede, Figural Exegesis and Historical Theory<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Furry Timothy J.<br>
  Abstract: What is history? This question can be taken in many ways, including radically skeptical ones, but in 'Allegorizing History' Timothy J. Furry asks the questions not with that axe to grind but because it has become clear to him, through study of Bede and other ancient Christians, that history is not so simple. To be sure, many, if not all scholars, know that thanks to the work of postmodern philosophers and twentieth-century historical theorists like R.G. Collingwood, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Hayden White. In this work, Furry shows that there are competing notions and purposes of historical practice, more specifically between Bede and the scholars who have recently studied him. Moreover, he explaisn why this difference matters and what implications result from such competing notions and practices of history, especially in the exegesis of Scripture as well as how exegesis also influences conceptions of history. Following a tradition of historians and theologians who have sought to blur the lines between theology and other disciplines, Furry explores how, if biblical exegesis was not an isolated discipline for ancient and medieval Christians, then its effects should be seen in other arenas. His argument here is that one of these arenas or disciplines is history.<br>

The following discussion examines selected aspects of the twists and turns of recent historical debate by using the example of research on census enumerations.

Il se sert de la sémiologie de l'image, de la poétique et des théories post-coloniales pour définir les enjeux théoriques, idéologiques et sémantiques régissant le passage des textes littéraires au cinéma. Il identifie des paramètres importants dans la poétique de l'écriture et montre le rôle de l'acte créateur dans l'altérité du texte dérivé, filmique, par rapport au texte de départ, littéraire. De ce fait, il formule des propositions novatrices par rapport aux interrogations purement spéculatives, thématiques ou idéologiques sur « l'adaptation », acte de recréation et de réécriture dont les mécanismes dépassent le seul cadre des cinémas africains.<br>

  Abstract: Elsy Gagné présente un texte qui oscille entre deux questions chères aux femmes canadiennes. À qui appartient-il de décider de la méthodologie à utiliser lorsqu’il s’agit de féminiser l’institution médicale «masculinisée»? À qui appartient-il de se soucier des femmes dont le corps a été amputé suite à une chirurgie majeure et mutilante ? A la première question, l’auteure répond en disant que la recherche médicale, à tendance positiviste, promeut la supériorité des approches quantitatives qui conduisent souvent à des conclusions décontextualisées du vécu des femmes. À la seconde, Gagné indique que l’institution médicale est peu apte à reconnaître les problèmes<br>

  Abstract: The question of thinking and living in the New World began, for the British in Acadia, with a problem of continuity of place. Fundamentally, theirs was the problem of imagining continuity where there was none. Complicating the issue, however, was the fact that a great many British settlers were possessed of a sense of identity that had been in some measure disfigured and that they were consequently trying to recover. In most cases, the identity that they sought to preserve was of British origin.<br>

  Abstract: Introduction If theology is, as Lonergan described it, a mediation “between a cultural matrix and the significance and role of a religion in that matrix”¹ then there are two major questions that arise in considering Berry’s contribution to Christian theology: (1) The methodological question: How is Berry’s “new story” situated in terms of mediating between Christianity and culture? In Lonergan’s terms, this is to ask whether methodologically the “new story” belongs to

  Author(s): SAVIDAN PATRICK<br>
  Abstract: Cet ouvrage à voix plurielles se place résolument dans une perspective interdisciplinaire. Neuf auteurs de premier plan, oeuvrant sous des horizons diversifiés, se confrontent à la crise actuelle de la démocratie. Une thèse centrale ordonne le travail d'analyse : cette crise tire son origine de l'oubli de la notion même de démocratie, dans le rejet de toute problématique de fondements. Identité et différence, communauté et pluralisme, droits individuels et droit collectifs, discours public et légitimation de valeurs, autant de problèmes cruciaux pour le renouvellement de la démocratie et de sa pratique publique, autant de centres autour desquels gravite la réflexion de la philosophie politique contemporaine. C'est ce qu'interroge ici chacune des contributions. Un fil rouge les traverse : la question de la reconnaissance de l'identité et de la différence.<br>

Les efforts philosophiques les plus marquants de ce siècle témoignent bien en effet du réinvestissement de cette grande question de la philosophie quant au statut véritable et à la nature de la raison, tant il est vrai que la réduction de celle-ci à sa dimension scientifique et instrumentale a pu paraître alors précisément comme une « réduction » dont il importait d’examiner le bien-fondé¹.

But women, he thought, shutting his pocket-knife, don’t know what passion is” (Woolf 1964, 89). At this moment, when his knife cuts so decisively through the question of women and passion and refolds within its sheath, a voice singing at the entrance to Regent’s Park Tube Station interrupts Peter’s anger. It sings “weakly,” and “shrilly,” a “voice of no age or sex” and “with an absence of all human meaning” (90). But, as the narrator’s consciousness displaces Peter Walsh’s, the<br>

  Abstract: As the essays in this volume demonstrate, the evidentiary basis for excluding the Gospel of John from the historical quest for Jesus is extensively flawed, critically. Many dozens, perhaps hundreds, of instances in which the Fourth Gospel arguably contributes to a fuller understanding of the life and ministry of the prophetic figure from Nazareth require renewed consideration if the fuller database of historical information about Jesus is to be consulted. The question, of course, is how to do so. While it might be safer and less likely to err to exclude John from the quest, such a conservatively reductionistic approach<br>

This has not infrequently been answered in the negative. That is, those who do not consider metaphysics to be a naturally knowable discipline with conclusions regarding God and the soul subject to demonstrative reason as such, apart from advertence to any revealed premise, will find it impossible to credit Aristotle as having so much as adverted to God rather than<br>

  Abstract: Leafing through introductory textbooks in Christian systematic theology, you will find discussions of salvation located in multiple places—under the topics of Christology (the nature and work of Christ), the “other” religions, and eschatology, the study of last or final things. Insofar as these primers orient elementary readers into knowledge of Christian faith, they set out the major points for theological discussion and debate. Eschatology often becomes the major landing point for discussions of salvation because the question of salvation is often framed in terms of ultimate ends. Under the doctrine of eschatology, soteriological discussions will circle around Jesus’s saying,<br>

  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hughes George<br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque's The Wedding Feast of the Lamb represents a turning point in his thought. Here, Falque links philosophy and theology in an original fashion that allows us to see the full effect of theology's "backlash" against philosophy. By attending closely to the incarnation and the eucharist, Falque develops a new concept of the body and of love: By avoiding the common mistake of "angelism"--consciousness without body--Falque considers the depths to which our humanity reflects animality, or body without consciousness. He shows the continued relevance of the question "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:52), especially to philosophy. We need to question the meaning of "this is my body" in "a way that responds to the needs of our time" (Vatican II). Because of the ways that "Hoc est corpus meum" has shaped our culture and our modernity, this is a problem both for religious belief and for culture.<br>

It has generated magisterial pronouncements, fulminated controversies that have fractured Christendom, and pitted religious orders against each other. Moreover, no commentator in whatever era can say anything meaningful about the subject without appealing to metaphysics, which finds little sympathy in today’s agnosticism about universal truth claims.

  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal ~<br>

But is it really? In asking the question “what is literature?” or “what is a genre?” we are confronted with a complex problem. One could answer the question in a straightforward manner, simply stating that literature is everything that our traditions recognize as literature and that genres are categories of texts, such as chronicles or missionary plays.

So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

Although they are not told to you as ‘lies’, the fact is that the people who narrate them are often uncertain as to whether they are true.

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

  Abstract: Love and Christian Ethicsaddresses significant authors, texts, and topics dealing with the interlaced meanings of divine love, love for God, neighbor love, and love for oneself. A recurring question is whether and how the Christian moral life amounts to a kind of eudaimonism.

Beyond these concerns, the collection practically reframes an ethic of agape regarding (and this is a partial list) love’s motivational effectiveness, sexual life, the moral repair of communities, and interreligious exchange.<br>

  Abstract: Hardly anything is more familiar to literary scholars than fictional narrative. Yet this simple term contains a slight tension between the

How can you invent what you know or know what you invent? In all standard models of narratology, the answer to this question has been to split the tasks and distinguish between the narrator who knows and the author whoinvents, and this is the case particularly in the framework of Gérard Genette.²<br>

  Abstract: We cannot answer the question of what makes mythology so attractive to writers and readers of modern literature if we remain with structure and semiotics alone and ignore myth’s talent for arguing for the numinous signifier and the validity of the supernatural. But, not surprisingly, that has been a much avoided question in modern literary criticism. The safest way of showing the relationship between the sacred and art, for example, has long been to emphasize art’s reference to or use of religious and mythological (meaning archetypal) motifs. Art becomes the transition between the numinous and the everyday. But as I<br>

Science establishes facts (“what is”), whereas morality decides “what should be,” but many admit that we cannot distinguish what should be from what is. I shall consider whether it is plausible to take an opposite, although perhaps rather surprising, approach and ask whether we can favor what should be from our knowledge about what is. In fact, such a question belongs to a long philosophical tradition, including Hume, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, and contemporary ethologists. My idea is to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q1xs0v">Divination and Human Nature</a><br>
  Abstract: One may enter the world of the Neoplatonists expecting that traditional divinatory thinking will find fertile ground. This ancient school, after all, advanced ideas on union with the divine, spiritual ascent through contemplative
                  askêsis, and the practice of theurgy. But the expectation is not exactly met. It is something of a enigma, which the prior work allows us to understand better. The most serious Neoplatonic thinker on the question, Iamblichus, will advance restrained views toward traditional divination, and will even be ready to toss aside the whole practice. He expresses these nuances while vigorously embracing a newly configured notion of<br>

  Author(s) Callahan Daniel<br>
  Abstract: The question of filial obligation is an ancient one, and every society and even generation creates its own ideal of the biblical “Honor thy father and mother.” Care for old members of the family was always a moral norm in European culture. It came out of the Judeo-Christian moral premise that it is human and moral to care for the old and helpless in the family and in the whole society and that the young and able have responsibility for those who cannot care for themselves. Relationships in the family based on intimacy and mutuality should be fulfilled with mutual<br>

  Abstract: On a fundamental level, the goals of medical education are necessarily derivative of the goals of medicine. Although overall, education is certainly a worthy end in its own right, the quintessential purpose of medical education is to provide society with professionals to fill a vital social need. Therefore, medical education’s specific goals depend entirely on a prior question: What sort of medical practitioners should our society aim to produce?<br>

  Abstract: Medicine must wear a human face and make human judgments. Indeed, the question of how judgments are made is tacitly present throughout any work on philosophy of medicine in clinical medical education or, more recently, bioethics. To be a sentient being is to make judgments; to be a physician or medical educator is to make judgments that may critically affect many others. In this essay, I examine the role of various components of judging and the process by which judgments are made.<br>

  Author(s) STOUT JANIS<br>
  Abstract: Anyone who works on Cather knows what a difference it makes to have or not to have the letters. Years of difficult access and the need to paraphrase, or to read only in someone else’s paraphrases, approximate at best, fastened our eyes toward a hoped-for future when the letters themselves, or at least some of them, would be readily accessible in print.

  Abstract: Scholars with a feminist awareness have often been intrigued by Philo of Alexandria, who stands at one of the most important watersheds of Western civilization, namely, at the juncture between Judaism and Hellenism in the first century CE, just before Christianity emerged and adopted many of his ideas. Philo’s views of women have regularly been seen as uniformly negative. The only open question has pertained to the origin of his views, whether they derived from Jewish or Greek sources.¹ In this context an important factor has regularly been overlooked, namely, Philo’s dramatic intellectual development as a result of his visit<br>

  Abstract: How can we place the first century of the Qing dynasty in worldhistorical time? Earlier generations of historians could not even conceive of this question. For Hegel and Marx, China until the nineteenth century was the land of eternal stagnation, embalmed in an airless coffin, never an active participant in the formation of the only progressive civilization, that of the West. Later historians, supporting nationalist and modernization movements, altered the vision slightly to include “change within tradition,” but they still cut off nearly all of imperial China’s history from the modern world.

  Author(s): Myers Jacob D.<br>
  Abstract: The real question for homiletics in our increasingly postmodern, post-Christian contexts is not how are we going to prevent preaching from dying, but how are we going to help it die a good death. Preaching was not made to live. At most, preaching is a witness, a sign, a crimson X marking a demolition site. The church has developed sophisticated technologies in modernity to give preaching the semblance of life, belying the truth: preaching was born under a death sentence. It was born to die. Only when preaching embraces its own death is it able to truly live.<br>

Such an inquiry I take to be central to the question: How do literary works relate to one another diachronically or synchronically?

  Abstract: As earlier chapters have pointed out, ‘popular’ is a capacious and slippery word. On the one hand, popular novels are simply the novels read and appreciated by a very large number of readers, as opposed to those that are canonised by critics and by literary histories but actually read by a relatively small élite. On the other hand, the ‘popular’ novel conjures up – if somewhat vaguely – a particular kind of fiction, raising the question of the aesthetic and philosophical specificity of the popular: do ‘popular’ novels conform to particular models of narrative? Do they deploy specifically ‘popular’ strategies?<br>

  Author(s): Mäkikalli Aino<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays studies the encounter between allegedly ahistorical concepts of narratology and eighteenth-century literature. It questions whether the general concepts of narratology are as such applicable to historically specific fields, or whether they need further specification. Furthermore, at issue is the question whether the theoretical concepts actually are, despite their appearance of ahistorical generality, derived from the historical study of a particular period and type of literature. In the essays such concepts as genre, plot, character, event, tellability, perspective, temporality, description, reading, metadiegetic narration, and paratext are scrutinized in the context of eighteenth-century texts. The writers include some of the leading theorists of both narratology and eighteenth-century literature.<br>

How do the multiple figures of Oedipus enact and inflect the philosophical, anthropological, and psychoanalytic aporias of modern Western episteme? In this essay, I attempt to tackle this question by thinking through the cleavages of heteronomy and autonomy, belonging and errancy, sovereignty and liminality, the body of the sovereign and the future of the body politic. I suggest a (literally) symptomatic reading of Oedipus’s body, one that illustrates a corporeal<br>

  Book Title: Questions of Phenomenology-Language, Alterity, Temporality, Finitude<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: The book is organized into four areas of inquiry: "Language and Logic," "The Self and the Other," "Temporality and History," and "Finitude and Mortality." In each, Dastur guides the reader through a series of phenomenological questions that also serve to call phenomenology itself into question, testing its limits and pushing it in new directions. Taking a cue from Merleau-Ponty, Dastur sees phenomenology not as a doctrine, a catalogue of concepts and catchphrases authored by a single thinker, but rather as a movement in which several thinkers participate, each contributing to and inflecting the movement in unique ways.<br>

This “issue” is, however, hardly more than a common name for a great variety of questions. Contemporary philosophical debates on rationalism versus relativism, universalism versus particularism, transculturalism versus multiculturalism, and so forth can be said to circle around the question of the Other as an emblematic figure representing difference, plurality, and strangeness.

  Author(s) Corigliano Stephanie<br>
  Abstract: How—and why—does one do comparative theology? As the essays in this volume demonstrate, there are as many answers to these questions as there are comparative theologians. One’s method and purpose even tends to vary from one project to the next.¹ In part, this is because theology is often driven by questions. Differing questions require differing methods of inquiry. Because comparative theologians delve deeply into more than one religious tradition, we are often compelled by more than one question at a time. Because this anthology addresses

  Abstract: Like a catechism, the

That question sets up the grammatical framework that structures the rest of the text: “How many parts of speech are there?” Beginning the text already with a specialized term from the discipline of grammar, the question fronts the idea of “parts of speech,” thus emphasizing it over the number of how many parts there are. Though the wordoratio, as not only “speech,” but also “prayer,” presents immediately a possible pun, Gerson passes over this<br>

In this process our epistemic structures become progressively more adequate. This constructivism, whatever conceptual flaws it may have, lies at the heart of Piaget’s theory of knowledge. An attempt to provide such a theory of knowledge we labelled “epistemology proper” or “normative epistemology.” Piaget’s constructivism, I suggested, is a theory about how we actually know. Constructivism can be viewed as an answer to the earlier (transcendental) question; how is it possible (developmentally) for us to have the knowledge we have? Piaget answers that<br>

  Abstract: The correlation of visual-spatial forms of dream bizarreness with waking measures of imagination and creativity is not sufficient to establish the metaphoric roots of such experience. Despite recent demonstrations of cortical antecedents in phasic REM discharge, it could still be that imagistic bizarreness works on the randomization model of creativity, so favored in current artificial intelligence accounts. On that model, creative imagery would operate by destroying the continuity of ongoing propositional intelligence, so that its later reestablishment would have to include novel and so potentially useful elements.

  Author(s): Lefèvre Sylvain<br>
  Abstract: Ouvrage clé permettant de comprendre le rôle politique des fondations subventionnaires, le présent collectif est la première grande synthèse de l’histoire de la philanthropie canadienne et québécoise. Dès le début du XXe siècle, la dimension sociopolitique des organisations philanthropiques a été remise en question : quelle légitimité d’action pouvaient avoir des acteurs privés fortunés dans le domaine de l’entraide ? Cet ouvrage répond à cette question en se basant sur une variété de travaux dirigés par différentes équipes de recherche. Plusieurs thèmes centraux sont abordés : survol historique et comparatif du rôle des fondations, au Québec, au Canada et ailleurs ; proposition de classification théorique et empirique des fondations ; caractérisation des relations entre les différents acteurs de l’éco­système philanthropique ; identification des stratégies mobilisées par ces différents acteurs ; réflexions sur le rôle des fondations dans la création de politiques publiques… Ce livre propose une vue d’ensemble éclairante du secteur de la philanthropie subventionnaire qui, malgré son champ d’action restreint, demeure fondamental dans les reconfigurations sociales en cours.<br>

  Book Title: The Superstitious Muse-Thinking Russian Literature Mythopoetically<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): Bethea David M.<br>
  Abstract: For several decades David Bethea has written authoritatively on the “mythopoetic thinking" that lies at the heart of classical Russian literature, especially Russian poetry. His theoretically informed essays and books have made a point of turning back to issues of intentionality and biography at a time when authorial agency seems under threat of “erasure" and the question of how writers, and poets in particular, live their lives through their art is increasingly moot. The lichnost’ (personhood, psychic totality) of the given writer is all-important, argues Bethea, as it is that which combines the specifically biographical and the capaciously mythical in verbal units that speak simultaneously to different planes of being. Pushkin’s Evgeny can be one incarnation of the poet himself and an Everyman rising up to challenge Peter’s new world order; Brodsky can be, all at once, Dante and Mandelstam and himself, the exile paying an Orphic visit to Florence (and, by ghostly association, Leningrad).This sort of metempsychosis, where the stories that constitute the Ur-texts of Russian literature are constantly reworked in the biographical myths shaping individual writers’ lives, is Bethea’s primary focus. This collection contains a liberal sampling of Bethea’s most memorable previously published essays along with new studies prepared for this occasion.<br>

From this magical zone of Russian writers with Pushkin at its core, one question will be central. How, and through what charmed intermediaries, does a poet create and then continue to<br>

  Author(s) Collins David B.<br>
  Abstract: THE CONCERN WITH the power of judgment arises in Hannah Arendt’s work in response to critical events in modernity. As a result of the impotence of familiar standards and categories to provide answers and orientation, this power has become undone. It is a question not only of the impotence of the common standards regarding certain events of modernity but also of the fact that these events have been so terrifying that they have altogether destroyed all our habitual categories of thought and standards of judgment. Yet, as Arendt remarks in 1953 in “Understanding and Politics (The Difficulties of Understanding),” that<br>

Given the powerful impact of their views on the public opinion in the country, one could say that the answer to such a question unveils to a great extent the very foundation of the social perception of the catastrophe experienced by the European Jews during the Second World War. Undeniably, this preliminary assumption does not simply imply a cause-effect relationship between those who articulate the mainstream public discourse and the larger society to which they belong; in many respects,<br>

  Abstract: The previous two chapters have raised a cluster of issues about the implications of Levinas’s understanding of embodiment for the relationship between human and nonhuman animals, particularly given his emphasis on the subject’s status as a creature. Levinas defends a very traditional form of anthropocentrism, which leads him to the conclusion that animals fall outside of the ethical encounter between the self and the other. He thus has very little to say about animals. But in the wake of his radical reconception of subjectivity—as heteronomous, embodied, and ineradicably affected by time—the question of how human creatures relate to<br>

The work probes a question of broad human significance. The Ilahita Arapesh, in the course of their long initiatory cycles, terrorised their children and subjected them to excruciating ordeals. Tuzin self-consciously ascribes the word ʹbrutalʹ to these acts, partly because many of the Ilahita themselves so saw them, but also because we, if we are honest with ourselves, do so as well.

  Abstract: As a first approach to the question at hand, I would like to consider the significance of the terms “representation” and “simulation.” In the title of this segment of the symposium, we find that simulation is referred to in the historical sense of an “age” and that representation is placed within die context of this age. In this paper, I take the position that representation, understood in the somewhat narrow sense of a referential means of thinking towards an end, can itself be considered as informing a historical age – one that establishes the ground for the age of simulation.<br>

Second, Groensteen tackles the question of rhythm in comics, and the skill demonstrated by virtuoso artists in intertwining different rhythms over and above the basic beat provided by the discontinuity of the panels. And third he resets the relationship of comics to contemporary art, conditioned by cultural history and aesthetic traditions but evolving recently as comics artists move onto avant-garde terrain.<br>

Aristotle is clear in the extant Poetics that plot is that through which the play does its work—it is the play’s archē and psuchē. It is particularly through recognitions and peripeties that tragic plots are made most emotionally effective, and this is especially so when they occur together (1450a32–34).

The anthropological turn of modernity, for the sake of pursuing more pressing matters or more deceivingly fundamental issues, presumed that severing the question of God from the inquiry into the human being’s own identity would give wings to the quest for knowledge. Instead, as postmodernity witnesses, this too-often rated “successful” revolution has yielded a radical dissolution of any unifying principle and thus, of man himself.<br>

  Abstract: How can mainstream Jewish hermeneutics make a significant contribution to the reading of Christian religious poetry? In examining this question, we will need to differentiate classical Jewish hermeneutics from the dominant hermeneutics of Western interpretive practice that has developed from its base in Christian hermeneutics. Limiting ourselves to the rabbinic and patristic periods in Judaism and Christianity (the first six centuries of the Common Era) will enable us to concentrate on the formative era of the hermeneutic approaches familiar to us today. Although our aim is to distinguish between these traditions, it is helpful, initially, to note some important similarities.<br>

Correspondingly, when he writes about ethics, he is always interested in the question: “What concept of man underlies a particular ethical theory?” I have been able, therefore, to explore the fundamental themes of Wojtyła’s anthropology and ethics while at the same time safeguarding<br>

The question that drives the Daseinanalytic of Sein und Zeit—the question of the being of time—first surfaces in Heidegger’s 1995 Scotus research. It reappears in the 1917–19 mysticism research, the remarks on Luther, the 1920–21 religion lectures, and the 1921–26 Aristotle research. The early Freiburg lectures document the variety of approaches Heidegger took to this problem, tentative solutions, experiments with language, and forays into the tradition, some that became lifelong projects, like the retrieval of non-Platonic Greek<br>

  Author(s) LaRocca David<br>
  Abstract: Can someone else write my autobiography? The question challenges the conventional meaning of autobiography. And since writing an autobiography—in America, after Benjamin Franklin—often occurs with an awareness that the status of the work is bound up with the authority of its author, the notion of authorship also becomes troubled.¹ For instance, because an autobiography appears to be direct communication from its author, the very conditions of its presentation may suggest we are reading a true story, a mere record of what happened. Yet, like the life it aims to account for, autobiography is fashioned, a literary artifact, necessarily<br>

  Abstract: The process of hermeneutical retrieval presupposes that the one who is attempting the retrieval is dealing adequately and fairly with the classic text, doctrine, or principle in question. While this is obvious, it offers a challenge to the one who would engage in a process of retrieval. A worthy process of retrieval demands that the classic element be dealt with in as balanced a manner as possible, without giving up the integrity of the process by highlighting only those aspects of the classic element that one either endorses or reviles. This requires the one retrieving to be aware of her<br>

A reasonable question immediately arises: What does it mean to consider the human sexual person adequately in order to respond to complex moral issues surrounding human sexuality? In response to this question we first formulate a foundational principle of human sexuality; we then expand on the morally significant dimensions of that principle; and finally we draw insight from these dimensions in our reconstructed definition of complementarity, a<br>

At a certain point, others are not just parts of my own or anyone else’s story, but also irreducible human beings in and of themselves.

And it does seem that religions can transform people: Some believers become selfless servants of the poor, or even suicide bombers. But how and why might this happen? Similar circumstances push people in quite different ways; “good intentions” alone are not sufficient for real conversion to some demanding new form of life.

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Offering a critical view of all the texts in which Wittgenstein mentions Freud, Bouveresse immerses us in the intellectual climate of Vienna in the early part of the twentieth century. Although we come to see why Wittgenstein did not view psychoanalysis as a science proper, we are nonetheless made to feel the philosopher's sense of wonder and respect for the cultural task Freud took on as he found new ways meaningfully to discuss human concerns. Intertwined in this story of Wittgenstein's grappling with the theory of the unconscious is the story of how he came to question the authority of science and of philosophy itself. While aiming primarily at the clarification of Wittgenstein's opinion of Freud, Bouveresse's book can be read as a challenge to the French psychoanalytic school of Lacan and as a provocative commentary on cultural authority.<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

It is a striking fact of our century that philosophy has become increasingly concerned with ordinary experience, ordinary language, everyday life, or the life-world, to cite four often-used expressions. This concern is evident in both wings of the two major contemporary philosophical movements, which are popularly if inaccurately designated as the analytical and the continental or phenomenological schools.

  Abstract: This book, which grew out of the Society of Biblical Literature’s Paul and Scripture Seminar, explores some of the methodological problems that have arisen during the last few decades of scholarly research on the apostle Paul’s engagement with his ancestral Scriptures. Essays explore the historical backgrounds of Paul’s interpretive practices, the question of Paul’s “faithfulness" to the context of his biblical references, the presence of Scripture in letters other than the Hauptbriefe, and the role of Scripture in Paul’s theology. All of the essays look at old questions through new lenses in an effort to break through scholarly impasses and advance the debate in new directions. The contributors are Matthew W. Bates, Linda L.

The pessimism, which is the key element for identifying the genre of the book, serves to lower expectations of the audience about human wisdom, God, and human effort/morality. The lowering of expectations was necessary for mitigating the dissonance that had been created by the optimism of traditional wisdom and Judaism and the oppressed condition of the Jews under Ptolemaic hegemony.

  Author(s) Wimbush Vincent L.<br>
  Abstract: Every narrative addressing the state of biblical studies in Bulgaria should begin with an odd and traumatic situation in the distant past of the country. Christianity was not at all a popular religion until the mid-ninth century. Each of the two tribes comprising the Bulgarian state, the local Slavs and the old Bulgarians (or Protobulgarians), who had migrated from Asia, had their established pantheon and rituals. In contrast to the aristocratic circles in both tribes, various pagan gods coexisted quite peacefully in the lives of the common people. The situation in question took place in the year 865 c.e.<br>

  Abstract: Nothing presents more problems for those who would enter the mentality of the medieval philosophical theologian than the task which has been set for this volume. Trying to judge the influence on Thomas Aquinas’s doctrine of one of his authoritative ancient sources requires us to surrender, at least provisionally, what we think we know about the authority in question. As heirs of Renaissance and modern philology, and of the modern constructions of the history of philosophy, we will almost certainly have a different, perhaps even opposed, view of the source than a medieval theologian would have had. Ironically, our problem<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

  Abstract: My ongoing project is to explore the question as to whether there is any reason to think, indeed hope, that the collecting and publishing of victims’ stories—the activities that surround writing a truth report—can bring an end to the cycle of revenge that threatens the stability of an emerging democracy. Is it sensible to suppose that language can carry such a burden? By examining some of the history of revenge and our troubled and ambivalent relationship to it, the early chapters have provided, I hope, a clearer understanding of what a victim such as Paulina might mean when<br>

Instead of assuming that “experience,” “emotions,” or “narratives” are existential givens, ontologically prior to certain cultural realities, we need to question their origins and makings.

  Book Title: Detecting Texts-The Metaphysical Detective Story from Poe to Postmodernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Susan Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to
      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

  Abstract: Describing the novel that would become 
                  The Third Policeman (1967), Flann O’Brien defines succinctly the postmodernist, or metaphysical, detective story.¹ In this twentieth-century divergence from classic mysteries, apparently orthodox tales of detection are populated by extraordinary detectives subject to unexpected rules of behavior. Metaphysical detection calls into question structures taken for granted after Edgar Allan Poe’s “Murders in the Rue Morgue” (1841): the hermeneutic strategies of rendering meaningful those signs which are unintelligible to others, and of divining the mind of an opponent; the epistemological method of discovering truth by questioning sources of knowledge; and the adept detective’s triumph over<br>

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

  Book Title: Theorizing Scriptures-New Critical Orientations to a Cultural Phenomenon<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMBUSH VINCENT L.<br>
  Abstract: Historically, religious scriptures are defined as holy texts that are considered to be beyond the abilities of the layperson to interpret. Their content is most frequently analyzed by clerics who do not question the underlying political or social implications of the text, but use the writing to convey messages to their congregations about how to live a holy existence. In Western society, moreover, what counts as scripture is generally confined to the Judeo-Christian Bible, leaving the voices of minorities, as well as the holy texts of faiths from Africa and Asia, for example, unheard. In this innovative collection of essays that aims to turn the traditional bible-study definition of scriptures on its head, Vincent L. Wimbush leads an in-depth look at the social, cultural, and racial meanings invested in these texts. Contributors hail from a wide array of academic fields and geographic locations and include such noted academics as Susan Harding, Elisabeth Shnssler Fiorenza, and William L. Andrews. Purposefully transgressing disciplinary boundaries, this ambitious book opens the door to different interpretations and critical orientations, and in doing so, allows an ultimately humanist definition of scriptures to emerge.<br>

The dialectic nature of these links is played out daily in our movement choices and bodymind awareness. Judith Butler asks what kind of performances will destabilize received and rehearsed categories. The possibilities of transformation may be found in a “failure to repeat, a de-formity.”¹ Dance forms are repeated daily, hourly, in rehearsal rooms around the world.

The emergence of technological contexts in the middle and later 1990s changed the landscape in which this question would arise.

The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be postmodern subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

  Abstract: The name ‘Auschwitz’ stands for what was without question one of the most traumatic events of the century. Equally, it names an event which emphatically dissolves moral scepticism; we feel morally certain that there evil of an unspeakable kind occurred. Perhaps, then, it is the utter proximity of these two thoughts, the
                     traumatic insistenceof the event of the Holocaust and our moralcertaintyabout its evil character, that lies behind and is the genealogical origin of recent attempts to identify trauma with ethicality as such. For example, in Emmanuel Levinas’Otherwise than Beingwe read:<br>

  Abstract: If twentieth-century attempts to give visual form to Famine memory are to be understood within a tradition of Famine image-making, the obvious antecedents lie in the visual representations of the Irish Famine from the nineteenth century. How was the Famine visually represented and interpreted in its own time, and what meanings do such images communicate? The evolution of the visual culture and representational history of ‘the Famine’ has yet to be satisfactorily mapped, and the relationship of its nineteenth-century iconography to latter-day visualizations both troubles and intrigues.

  Abstract: Over the past two decades, we have witnessed what Françoise Lionnet has termed the ‘becoming-transnational’ of French Studies.¹ French and the other modern languages had originally been constructed as academic subjects around the framework of the nineteenth-century European nation-state but, as the primacy of the nation state has come to be challenged in the era of globalisation, this structure has been increasingly questioned by scholars working from transnational, global and postcolonial perspectives.² The prominent North American critic Lawrence Kritzman has been prompted to ask, in light of these developments, whether the very existence of French Studies is now in question:<br>

  Abstract: The question of the emergence of a common world out of a diverse set of founding assumptions – and the question of what sort of world it can be – are crucial in the context of pronounced regional varieties of world-making conceptions. Assuming that world-making possibly means that a society must be framed, then this frame entails rules – i.e., rules can be the frame. This call for rules answers Nancy Fraser’s call (in Chapter 10) for a frame. But the frame she suggests should be of a special kind.

As Georges Minois points out in his overview of the history of suicide, the early Christian Church seemed to give out mixed messages on the question: the earthly life is a vale of tears and the Christian should aspire to death so that he/she can be united with God<br>

Its driving interest is instead ontological—an interest in the question of the “meaning of being.” Yet inasmuch as the work adopts a thoroughly hermeneuticized approach to ontology—the very focus on themeaningof being suggests as such—so the inquiry into ontology also involves Heidegger in an inquiry into the “structure” of understanding. Although the explicitly hermeneutic focus disappears from Heidegger’s later work, still the concern with understanding, thought in terms of a broader happening of disclosedness—a happening of world—can be seen<br>

  Abstract: G. F. Handel’s oratorios were a development of the later years of his career, being written during the period 1732–1752. Most of the oratorios were “sacred dramas,” that is, operatic versions of Old Testament narratives, and they often had political as well as theological resonances. The oratorios were a chance development, having their origin in a piece written initially by Handel in 1718 or thereabouts for private performance at Cannons, the country seat of James Brydges (later duke of Chandos). The piece in question was

  Abstract: Tours et détoursexamine l'inscription du mythe de Babel dans la littérature contemporaine de langue française. Le mythe s'avère une source d'inspiration pour les auteurs examinés qui évoquent justement des phénomènes sociaux actuels, tels que le multiculturalisme, l'immigration, l'exil, la pluralité des langues, la traduction et l'identité. Les ouvrages étudiés, tous écrits en français mais issus de différents contextes linguistiques et culturels, mettent en lumière de nouvelles interprétations du mythe de Babel. Pendant longtemps le mythe de Babel et la pluralité linguistique et culturelle qui s'ensuivent ont été considérés une malédiction pour l'humanité, mais les romans à l'étude remettent en question cette vision négative. Sans exalter les bienfaits de la multiplicité, ils considèrent comment la pluralité linguistique et culturelle enrichit et façonne la production littéraire ainsi que le monde contemporain.Les auteurs et œuvres étudiés sont• Monique Bosco,Babel-Opéra• Hédi Bouraoui,Ainsi parle la tour CN• Francine Noël,Babel, prise deux ou Nous avons tous découvert l'Amérique• Ernest Pépin,Tambour-Babel• Jorge Semprun,L'Algarabie<br>

  Abstract: How is the mental related to the physical? Answering this question is the mind-body problem. The three concepts that have often and prominently been invoked in recent discussions of the mind-body problem are those of “supervenience,” “emergence,” and “realization.” Some have claimed that mentality—in particular, consciousness and intentionality, are “emergent properties,” properties that emerge from complex configurations of physical/biological events and yet are irreducible to them. In the heyday of positivism and reductionism, emergentism used to be ridiculed as an example of unsavory pseudo-scientific doctrines, not quite as disreputable as, say, neo-vitalism, with its entelechies or

  Abstract: Are the humanities still relevant in the twenty-first century? In the context of pervasive economic liberalism and shrinking budgets, the importance of humanities research for society is increasingly put into question. This volume claims that the humanities do indeed matter by offering empirically grounded critical reflections on contemporary cultural practices, thereby opening up new ways of understanding social life and new directions in humanities scholarship. The contributors argue that the humanities can regain their relevance for society, pose new questions and provide fresh answers, while maintaining their core values: critical reflection, historical consciousness and analytical distance.<br>

  Abstract: Why does textual scholarship matter? Most students of literature and culture who worked in the twentieth century would have thought that a highly specialized question, and many still do. But a hundred years ago the question would hardly have been posed at all. Until the early decades of the twentieth century what we now call literary and cultural studies was called philology, and all its interpretive procedures were clearly understood to be grounded in textual scholarship. But twentieth-century textual studies shifted their center from philology to hermeneutics, that subset of philological inquiry focused on the specifically literary interpretation of culture.<br>

This is primarily due to developments that occurred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and which are still inextricably linked to current discussions of the question. From the 1890s onward, a romanticized image of the samurai emerged, motivated by cultural and political currents at the time. The major lasting effect of this idealization was the idea that “warrior thought” represented an independent and relatively homogeneous intellectual tradition<br>

  Author(s): DURNIN KATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: On Diary is the second collection in English of the groundbreaking and profoundly influential work of one of the best-known and provocative theorists of autobiography and diary. Ranging from the diary’s historical origins to its pervasive presence on the Internet, from the spiritual journey of the sixteenth century to the diary of Anne Frank, and from the materials and methods of diary writing to the question of how diaries end, these essays display Philippe Lejeune’s expertise, eloquence, passion, and humor as a commentator on the functions, practices, and significance of keeping or reading a diary. Lejeune is a leading European critic and theorist of diary and autobiography. His landmark essay, "The Autobiographical Pact," has shaped life writing studies for more than thirty years, and his many books and essays have repeatedly opened up new vistas for scholarship. As Michael Riffaterre notes, "Lejeune’s work on autobiography is the most original, powerful, effective approach to a difficult subject. . . . His style is very personal, lively. It grabs the reader as scholarship rarely does. Lejeune’s erudition and methodology are impeccable." Two substantial introductory essays by Jeremy Popkin and Julie Rak place Lejeune’s work within its critical and theoretical traditions and comment on his central importance within the fields of life writing, literary genetic studies, and cultural studies.<br>

It also addresses how this book contributes more specifically to our understanding of women and class in contemporary South Korea.

  POSTMODERN DEMOCRACY IN A MODE OF INFORMATION from:

  Author(s) Dallmayr Fred<br>
  Abstract: The question of the relationship (complementarity? tension? mutual exclusion?) between universalism and particularism occupies a central place in the current political and theoretical agenda. Universal values are seen either as dead or—at the very least—as threatened. What is more important, the positive character of those values is no longer taken for granted. On the one hand, under the banner of multiculturalism, the classical values of the Enlightenment are under fire and considered little more than the cultural preserve of Western imperialism. On the other hand, the whole debate concerning the end of modernity, the assault on foundationalism in<br>

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Abstract: A fundamental mutation in the question of agency takes place between two movements, in a space that we can label the Enlightenment/post-Enlightenment divide. Literature is one of the cultural sites that embodies the consequences of this mutation. As Peter Bürger notes, there is a point at which the activity of the philosophes needs to slide from philosophical inquiry into aesthetic production to carry out the project of the autonomy of reason (1992, 8–11). Through this movement, aesthetics in general and the literary domain in particular become the site of absolute freedom in modern societies, that is, a site where<br>

  Abstract: Religious identity’s second facet is assumption as in consciously taking something on, like assuming the responsibilities of office upon being sworn in. Usually the second facet is a response to challenges that question or present alternatives to a religious identity that, heretofore, had simply been assumed. These challenges need not result in radical change, although, as we saw earlier in some of the self-accounts, they can. More often they produce a process of distancing, uncertainty, and reformulation.<br>

  Abstract: In a penetrating inquiry into the history of modern prison reform, the late Norval Morris, a legal scholar at the University of Chicago, asked us to confront the question of why prison conditions merit a society’s most serious consideration. Part of the answer, said Morris, “is to be found in the fact that the criminal justice system exercises the greatest power that a state can legally use against its citizens.” Consequently, the treatment of convicted criminals discloses the functioning norms of human decency and fairness, the protections of citizenship, and the restraints on the exercise of force that pervade the<br>

Born in isolation, Russian meta-utopian fiction is certainly not an isolated phenomenon. It parallels the renewed attention to language, semiotic play, and narrative structure that has figured so importantly in the West in opening up new insight into ideological structures. Its challenge to maximalist, bipolar thinking and its argument for the middle ground makes meta-utopian fiction very much of a piece with current social, literary, and philosophical discourse.

  Abstract: The static blooms of Adonis provide us with an answer to our question ‘What would the lover ask of time?’ As Plato formulates it, the answer brings us once again to the perception that lovers and readers have very similar desires. And the desire of each is something paradoxical. As lover you want ice to
                  beice and yet not melt in your hands. As reader you want knowledge tobeknowledge and yet lie fixed on a written page. Such wants cannot help but pain you, at least in part, because they place you at a blind point from<br>

  Abstract: What is it to read novels? This is the question asked at the outset of this study. It is clear by now that there is no one simple answer. Readings differ depending on the kind of novel being read and the reader’s purpose, interests, and ideology. By opening the interpretive space between reader and text to include both text interpretation and self-interpretation, the frames of reference that come into play are multiplied. Moreover, the emphasis in recent theories of reading on emotional response—in particular the enjoyment readers get from taking an active part—opens up new directions for a<br>

  Author(s) Crosman Inge<br>
  Abstract: When raising the question of the reader’s status in the text, we may have in mind two sets of problems. According to one approach, the reader is thought of as an end conceived by the writer, whose work, accordingly, may be read in reference to the idea we have of that reader. A certain number of studies have enriched the history of literary criticism in this way, showing that the expectations of a particular public aimed at by the writer were determinative down to the most secret strata of the text (Jauss’s
                     Erwartungshorizontfor example).<br>

The answer is highly complex because in certain respects Blake was both, and because neither term has much meaning until it is illuminated by a specific context.

  Abstract: The distinction between history and fiction is once again stirring the interest of critics.¹ The question seemed settled in premodern times, when history was assumed to narrate the particular and poetry the general. True, until the nineteenth century, history was counted among the belles lettres, but that was a matter of stylistic kinship rather than of epistemological classification. Later, the practitioners of modern historiography became confident that their trade was more scientific than literary; therefore, the attempts to find new criteria for distinguishing history from poetry were welcomed.

Perhaps most important, recent anthropological writing has called into question the legitimacy with which we represent the “Other” in cultural written accounts. Indeed, insights gained into the nature of representation and power relations have made impossible the comfortable assumption that other cultures can be grasped, categorized, and put on paper.

  Abstract: I began this study by suggesting one response to the question of why so many of Canada’s acclaimed novelists begin and continue as poets. For Cohen, Ondaatje, Bowering, Marlatt, and Carson, the long poem facilitated the transition from the lyric to the novel by allowing them to develop serial forms of narrative that can convey a sense of duration without sacrificing the intensity and concision of the lyric. The authors apply these serial techniques differently in their novels and address particular regional, political, and aesthetic concerns, which has garnered them acclaim in diverse quarters.<br>

During that argument I also made the claim that Levinas’ understanding of self-identicality was squarely rooted in the priority of language as that which inserts itself between the “closed society” of the couple and as that which maintains the transcendence of the “ego” and the “other.” Both these arguments turn around a common centre: recognition.

Rather than mobilize these features to recreate a full-blown apocalypse, however, both fictions rely on familiar apocalyptic topoi to launch a critique of apocalyptic eschatology.Headhunterchallenges the apocalyptic narrative by blurring the boundary between the elect and the non-elect, thereby calling into question apocalyptic notions of perfection as well as the category of the Saints of God. WhileThe English Patientmaintains the latter category, it subverts the logic of apocalypse by adopting and adapting allegory, another of its key tropes.<br>

  Book Title: Diasporic Feminist Theology-Asia and Theopolitical Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kang Namsoon<br>
  Abstract: How do we navigate the question of identity in the fluid and pluralist conditions of postmodern society? Even more, how do we articulate identity as a defining particularity in the disappearance of borders, boundaries, and spaces in an increasingly globalist world? What constitutes identity and the formation of narratives under such conditions? How do these issues affect not only discursive practices, but theological and ethical construction and practice? This volumes explores these issues in depth. Diasporic Feminist Theology attempts to construct feminist theology by adopting diaspora as a theopolitical and ethical metaphor. Namsoon Kang here revisits and reexamines today’s significant issues such as identity politics, dislocation, postmodernism, postcolonialism, neoempire, Asian values, and constructs diasporic, transethnic, and glocal feminist theological discourses that create spaces of transformation, reconciliation, hospitality, worldliness, solidarity, and border-traversing. This work draws on diverse sources from contemporary critical discourses of diaspora studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, postmodernism, postcolonialism, and feminism and feminist theology from a transterritorial space. This book is a landmark work, providing a comprehensive discourse for feminist theology today.<br>

  Abstract: That the lives of the four theologians of our study are roughly contemporary, that their theological enterprises are not dissimilar, and their vocations as teachers and formators the same, means that by this stage the benefits of a cumulative and composite picture are beginning to be felt. Hopefully, with each chapter, further depth and a changed perspective are provided to the central question. Yet, while similarities in the broad outlines of the writers’ lives allow for the establishment of certain coordinates, the unique response of each provides particularity and nuance.¹ Such parallels, intersections, similarities, and distinctions should become apparent from<br>

  Abstract: Context matters. We can understand the words and actions of others only with knowledge of the contexts in which those words were spoken and those actions taken. For example, whether someone thinks it is appropriate to wear shoes in one’s home depends on their historical and cultural context.

  Book Title: Dark Traces of the Past-Psychoanalysis and Historical Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains an open debate that is full of tension, in both a positive and a negative sense. In particular, the following question has not been answered satisfactorily: what distinguishes a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities from a historical psychoanalysis? Skepticism and fear of collaboration dominate on both sides. Initiating a productive dialogue between historical studies and psychoanalysis seems to be plagued by ignorance and, at times, a sense of helplessness. Interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. Empirical research, formulation of theory, and the development of methods are essentially carried out within the conventional disciplinary boundaries. This volume undertakes to overcome these limitations by combining psychoanalytical and historical perspectives and thus exploring the underlying "unconscious" dimensions and by informing academic and nonacademic forms of historical memory. Moreover, it puts special emphasis on transgenerational forms of remembrance, on the notion of trauma as a key concept in this field, and on case studies that point the way to further research.<br>

As the road movie is dif-fi cult to identify in culturally specific terms, and is therefore always a genre in search of its identity, a French road movie is engaged in a constant negotiation of its own physical and conceptual boundaries. In fact, as I hope to have shown, analysing the ‘French road movie’ ultimately begs the question of its ‘French-ness’. If the road movie, to an extent, resists being<br>

  Book Title: The Train Journey-Transit, Captivity, and Witnessing in the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Gigliotti Simone<br>
  Abstract: Deportations by train were critical in the Nazis' genocidal vision of the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question." Historians have estimated that between 1941 and 1944 up to three million Jews were transported to their deaths in concentration and extermination camps. In his writings on the "Final Solution," Raul Hilberg pondered the role of trains: "How can railways be regarded as anything more than physical equipment that was used, when the time came, to transport the Jews from various cities to shooting grounds and gas chambers in Eastern Europe?" This book explores the question by analyzing the victims' experiences at each stage of forced relocation: the round-ups and departures from the ghettos, the captivity in trains, and finally, the arrival at the camps. Utilizing a variety of published memoirs and unpublished testimonies, the book argues that victims experienced the train journeys as mobile chambers, comparable in importance to the more studied, fixed locations of persecution, such as ghettos and camps.<br>

Among the many authors dealing with this subject, Farrell (1999) has examined rhetoric in terms of practice, and practice in terms of rhetoric, and his questions are very close to those I pose below. However, we differ in our basic interests—philosophy for him, ethnography for me—and while Farrell examines the political<br>

Instilling the people with properly national characteristics, modeled after national heroes, has been a central preoccupation for educators, artists, and scholars. Transgressive candidates for national heroes make this task harder but not impossible. Hence it is necessary to rephrase the question.

  Abstract: Dedicated to increasing our knowledge and awareness of the ever-growing diversity and pluralism of global society, Forum A. & A. Leysen has initiated an annual debate/lecture series, beginning with a focus on Islam in today's world and in Europe in particular. Seven well-known influential authorities - each an active participant in the public debate on the global role of Islam past, present and future - recently presented papers at the first Intercultural Relations Conference sponsored by Forum A.& A. Leysen. These important contributions, on the topic Islam and Europe: Challenges and Opportunities, are reprinted in this volume. Although each contributor speaks from his own distinctive point of view, a common message emerges from all seven texts: only dialogue - on the one hand between the West (countries that manifest themselves as Western Democratic constitutional states) and Islam, and on the other hand within and among societies historically identified with Islam- will overcome entrenched confrontation and negative animosity, engender new possibilities and understandings, and, by encouraging free and critical thinking, pave the way to social equity and the scientific innovation that, potentially, can lead to more prosperity. In the course of the conference all seven talks led to fascinating debates. This book includes the most important questions asked and the speakers' responses. Although the question of how to actually construct the dialogue remains unsettled, this ground-breaking book takes a giant step toward an answer.<br>

  Book Title: Synthetic Biology and Morality-Artificial Life and the Bounds of Nature<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Murray Thomas H.<br>
  Abstract: Synthetic biology, which aims to design and build organisms that serve human needs, has potential applications that range from producing biofuels to programming human behavior. The emergence of this new form of biotechnology, however, raises a variety of ethical questions -- first and foremost, whether synthetic biology is intrinsically troubling in moral terms. Is it an egregious example of scientists "playing God"?
      Synthetic Biology and Moralitytakes on this threshold ethical question, as well as others that follow, offering a range of philosophical and political perspectives on the power of synthetic biology.The contributors consider the basic question of the ethics of making new organisms, with essays that lay out the conceptual terrain and offer opposing views of the intrinsic moral concerns; discuss the possibility that synthetic organisms are inherently valuable; and address whether, and how, moral objections to synthetic biology could be relevant to policy making and political discourse. Variations of these questions have been raised before, in debates over other biotechnologies, but, as this book shows, they take on novel and illuminating form when considered in the context of synthetic biology.ContributorsJohn Basl, Mark A.

But the gap between fantasy and actual technological capacity is closing, so that now the morality of power must speak to the governance of power; ethics must inform public policy.

  Author(s) Zakovitch Yair<br>
  Abstract: On one level, there is a simple answer to the question “What is scripture for the Jews?” For roughly the past two thousand years, Jews have had a canon of twenty-four books that form the Jewish Bible,¹ starting with Genesis and ending with Chronicles.² Some Jewish groups up until about two thousand years ago accepted additional books as scripture, but by the end of the first century CE the canon used by Jews today was more or less universally accepted by all Jews. In this respect, Jews differ from Christians, since to this day there are books regarded by Orthodox<br>

  Abstract: There would seem to be a gap in my thinking that now it is time to try to discuss. My notion of the dys-/disarticulate appears to fall under the broad category of “disability” as it has been delineated over the past twenty years in the field of disability studies. I have referred to some of this work in preceding chapters, but have not yet addressed directly the question of this project’s relation to the field. The study of dys-/disarticulation is in part a study of the uses and changes in terminologies for people with varieties of cognitive impairment—idiot, feebleminded,<br>

  Abstract: This collection of essays on the question of what makes Latino/a biblical interpretation “Latino/a” raises a central and intriguing issue for critics and readers alike: Is identity a matter of being and/or practice? Is the “Latino/a-ness” of an interpretation defined by the personal identity (howsoever defined) of the interpreter? Or is it a matter of how Latino/a biblical interpretation is practiced—that is, are there certain principles, sources, methods (reading strategies), or aims that make some biblical interpretations Latino/a and others not?

In positing this development, in the words of Stuart Hall 1989) as “the question of identity,” I draw attention to the contestation and struggles over what it means to talk about identity and to the identifications that are invoked in the process of talking and writing.

  Abstract: What general social changes are implied by the struggle against poverty and against social injustice in general?

At first glance, the question in this form is ambiguous. The most basic transformations cannot be guilelessly defined in terms of poverty alone. Thus poverty is in danger of being lost sight of.

  Abstract: As we pointed out in Chapter 1, globalization defines the epoch in which we are living right now. As we noted, the word “globalization” means that the earth has been or is trying to be enclosed within a globe. Enclosing the earth in a globe means that all the ways out have been closed, so that one species, the human, is able to dominate all the other species. What justifies, what gives us the right to dominate the animals? The answer to this question is well-known: humans believe they have the right to dominate because humans believe that they possess<br>

  Abstract: What is the relationship between Foucault’s concept of biopower and Deleuze’s concept of control? Despite the similarities between these two concepts, there is not a single scholarly article that solely thematizes this question, nor a comparative survey of the answers given so far. This essay aims to fill this lacuna. Despite the lack of a full-length interrogation of this question, scholars have taken up several different positions on the relationship between these two concepts. While some distinguish the two concepts based on the content of what they act on (biopower on life vs control on economics), others distinguish them based<br>

  Author(s) Janz Bruce B.<br>
  Abstract: Much of Continental philosophy of religion is reflection on faith (as response to revelation) and reason (as philosophical reflection). Having made the linguistic turn, it intersects with analytic discussion of the problem of religious language, at least if the question is understood as concerning the nature and limits of our God-talk rather than its warrant. Since philosophy often takes the form of phenomenology, the question can be put this way: does reason, so conceived, prescribe the limits within which our Godtalk must stay (as in Kant’s
                  Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone), or does it describe the limits that<br>

  Abstract: They want to put metaphysics in motion, in action. They want to make it act and make it carry out immediate acts. It is not enough, therefore, for them to propose a new representation of movement; representation is already mediation. Rather, it is a question of producing within the work a movement capable of affecting the mind outside of all representation; it is a question of making movement itself a work … (Deleuze [1968] 1994: 8)<br>

From the disciplinary perspective of Anglo-American film studies, it is a belated intervention indeed. For the question of the spectator is the terrain upon which many of the most significant disciplinary battles over the politics of film theory have been waged over the past three decades. In that time, critical approaches to spectators have proliferated: feminist revisions of psychoanalysis; cultural studies models of differentially ‘decoding’ viewers;<br>

                  Not‘doing research’ is nowadays an unacceptable position for academics; to be described as ‘not research active’ implies (and indeed invokes) isolation in the distant steppes of the academic world, in which the only possible redemptive activity is teaching undergraduates.

  Abstract: This volume covers a broad historical sweep and takes into account those non-Christian philosophers that have had a great impact on the Christian tradition. However, it concentrates on the issues that perplex Christian philosophers as they seek to think through their faith in a philosophical way and their philosophical beliefs in the light of their faith. Examples of the topics discussed are the question of whether and how God knows the future, whether we actually know that God exists, and what Athens has to do with Jerusalem. The leaders of the recent revival of Christian analytic philosophy, especially Alvin Plantinga, Nicholas Wolterstorff, William Alston, and Robert Adams are also included.<br>

  Abstract: The problem of universal history does not result from the possibility of organising the universe in time, but rather from considering time as a universe. How is it possible to grasp time – structured by the present (maximal presence), the past (weakening of presence), and the future (maximal absence) – as a cumulative order of all past instants, from the most remote to the most present? We raised this question in Chapter III of this book. Universal history inscribes objects and events in an order of comprehension, which leads to the present and points towards the future.

What is the political moment in deconstruction? Can deconstruction provide an account of justice and a just polity?

That is, the way in which desire is, though productive, socially produced and managed such that it comes to desire its own repression (capitalism) and/or comes to be shaped in a manner conducive to the continual functioning of capitalism.

Perhaps knowledge of time is in some way the domain of philosophy, so that wherever it is that the novel goes with time, by being beyond the limits of philosophy, it cannot be an adventure in knowledge as such. There are two intimately related questions about knowledge involved in this. The first is the oldest question of all, the question of the relationship between philosophy and literature,<br>

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

There can be no question that our cognitive control of the future must involve us in an assessment of the probability of events that we foresee, and it seems likely that the events that we do not foresee are the lowest probability events.

It is a signature claim of philosophical hermeneutics and follows directly upon Gadamer’s assertion of the phenomenological priority of meaning in the experience of art. Not only does this emphasise Gadamer’s dialogical approach to art but it is the culmination of his critique of aesthetic subjectivism. By asserting the primacy of meaning, philosophical hermeneutics affirms the ontic priority of those cultural horizons which shape a spectator’s consciousness and in which he or she must partake as a precondition of achieving transformed understanding.

  Book Title: Regional Modernisms-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moran James<br>
  Abstract: Where did literary modernism happen? In this book, a range of scholars seek to answer this question, re-evaluating the parameters of modernism in the light of recent developments in literary geography as well as literary history, examining an array of different literary forms including novels, poetry, theatre, and ‘little magazines’. The volume identifies and appraises the local attachments of modernist texts in particular geographical regions and also interrogates the idea of the 'regional' in light of the alienating displacements of transnational modernity. The essays collected here make fresh interventions in the field of modernist studies and acknowledge the legacies of regional modernisms for post-war representations of place and landscape.

Despite North’s subtle intertwinings, the literary articulation of dialect forms is not only a question of race, but also a<br>

  Author(s) Marx Sensing<br>
  Abstract: In the 1980s, just as the textual revolution was entering its secondary phase and sweeping the discipline, a few anthropologists began to question the disembodied nature of much of contemporary ethnography and its conceptual reliance on language-based models of analysis. Their work prepared the ground for a sensual turn in anthropological understanding—that is, a move away from linguistic and textual paradigms toward an understanding that treats cultures as ways of sensing the world. This chapter documents this countertradition within the anthropology of the 1980s and 1990s, which culminated in the emergence of the anthropology of the senses.<br>

  Abstract: Three decades ago, Sartori complained about the number of “unconscious thinkers” in the field of comparative politics, and the same could be said of the study of international relations.¹ Most qualitative analyses were idiographic rather than nomothetic,² historically specific rather than theoretically driven, and too little concerned with the logic of inference and questions of generalizability. Scholars gave little attention to the problem of how to control for extraneous variables in situations in which the number of variables typically exceeded the number of cases, or to the question of whether there are alternative methods for validating causal inferences in a<br>

  Abstract: Tumultuous are the lives of theories. Conceived in the serenity of academy, they may find themselves forced into the real world and subjected to the vicissitudes of politics. This migration of theories from academia to the real world is what raises the question of theoreticians’ responsibility. Are the theoreticians responsible for the real-world ramifications, political harms, and moral wrongs resulting from their theorizing, and what sort of responsibility do they bear? The political biography of the democratic peace thesis discussed earlier in the book will help us answer these questions.<br>

  Abstract: Understanding continuity and change in international order is a central question in the study of International Relations. IR theories conceptualize order in different ways. Each theory underpins a narrative about how an effective resolution to obstacles or tensions in the international system can be reached and stability secured. Neorealists conceive order as the result of power balances in the international system between dominant states (Waltz 1979). The English school conceives order being built on a “society of states” (Bull 2002; Linklater and Suganami 2006; Linklater 2007).

  Book Title: American Night-The Literary Left in the Era of the Cold War<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): WALD ALAN M.<br>
  Abstract: American Night, the final volume of an unprecedented trilogy, brings Alan Wald's multigenerational history of Communist writers to a poignant climax. Using new research to explore the intimate lives of novelists, poets, and critics during the Cold War, Wald reveals a radical community longing for the rebirth of the social vision of the 1930s and struggling with a loss of moral certainty as the Communist worldview was being called into question. The resulting literature, Wald shows, is a haunting record of fracture and struggle linked by common structures of feeling, ones more suggestive of the "negative dialectics" of Theodor Adorno than the traditional social realism of the Left.Establishing new points of contact among Kenneth Fearing, Ann Petry, Alexander Saxton, Richard Wright, Jo Sinclair, Thomas McGrath, and Carlos Bulosan, Wald argues that these writers were in dialogue with psychoanalysis, existentialism, and postwar modernism, often generating moods of piercing emotional acuity and cosmic dissent. He also recounts the contributions of lesser known cultural workers, with a unique accent on gays and lesbians, secular Jews, and people of color. The vexing ambiguities of an era Wald labels "late antifascism" serve to frame an impressive collective biography.<br>

  Abstract: Spanning over nine hundred years, Eight Women Philosophers is the first singly-authored work to trace the themes of standard philosophical theorizing and feminist thought across women philosophers in the Western tradition. Jane Duran has crafted a comprehensive overview of eight women philosophers--Hildegard of Bingen, Anne Conway, Mary Astell, Mary Wollstonecraft, Harriet Taylor Mill, Edith Stein, Simone Weil, and Simone de Beauvoir--that underscores the profound and continuing significance of these thinkers for contemporary scholars. _x000B_Duran devotes one chapter to each philosopher and provides a sustained critical analysis of her work, utilizing aspects of Continental theory, poststructuralist theory, and literary theory. She situates each philosopher within her respective era and in relation to her intellectual contemporaries, and specifically addresses the contributions each has made to major areas such as metaphysics/epistemology, theory of value, and feminist theory. She affirms the viability and importance of recovering these women's overlooked work and provides a powerful answer to the question of why the rubric "women philosophers" remains so valuable.<br>

  Book Title: Agitating Images-Photography against History in Indigenous Siberia<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Craig<br>
  Abstract: Agitating Imagesprovides a glimpse into the first moments of cultural engineering in remote areas of Soviet Siberia. The territories were perceived by outsiders to be on the margins of civilization, replete with shamanic rituals and inhabited by exiles, criminals, and "primitive" indigenous peoples. The Soviets hoped to permanently transform the mythologized landscape by establishing socialist utopian developments designed to incorporate minority cultures into the communist state. This book delves deep into photographic archives from these Soviet programs, but rather than using the photographs to complement an official history, Campbell presents them as anti-illustrations, or intrusions, that confound simple narratives of Soviet bureaucracy and power. Meant to agitate, these images offer critiques that cannot be explained in text alone and, in turn, put into question the nature of photographs as historical artifacts.<br>

Within the same essay, Yumeno went on to elaborate the comparison:<br>

  Abstract: It seems simple. Because life is riddled with mystery and uncertainty, an existential faith may encounter paradoxes that call its claim to universality into question. So a dictum becomes tempting: wherever mystery and freedom meet, a variety of faiths bubble up; wherever, therefore, people prize freedom they will support a significant presumption in favor of honoring that variety. Many give preliminary consent to such a dictum. But it quickly runs into difficulties. Christians have often insisted that because their faith is universal it must be sanctioned by public ethics in the states or civilizations they inhabit. Secularists, while praising religious<br>

  Abstract: This chapter considers some examples that radically question the phenomenology of the trace. I will acknowledge representations and media contexts beyond photography and film or narratives that involve a critical reflection on the production and reproduction of public memory in moving images. I stress the thematic persistence of the trace in documentary, while at the same time reflecting on the limitations of the phenomenological discourse in relation to contemporary media. At this point it is also relevant to acknowledge an important theme in Ricœur’s reassessment of the philosophy of memory: the possibility of the erroneous memory and the fact that<br>

  Author(s): NEUMANN MARK<br>
  Abstract: Why do nearly five million people travel to the Grand Canyon each year? Mark Neumann answers this question with a book as compelling as the panoramic vistas of the canyon. In On the Rim, he describes how the Grand Canyon became an internationally renowned tourist attraction and cultural icon, and delves into the meanings the place holds for the individuals who live, work, and travel there. “In the chasm’s dizzying depths and flamboyant displacement of solid ground, as well as in the perceptions of those drawn there-explorers and day-trippers, employees and outlaws, artists and fast-buck artists-Neumann discovers a context in which to examine cultural and experimental fissures that separate leisure and work, home and away, religion and science, art and life. . . . A lively read.” Boston Globe<br>

The synchronous recording of sound and sight in the documentary interview presents us, then, with another instance of the confrontation of the look and the gaze in cinema.

  Abstract: Utopia has long been banished from political theory, framed as an impossible-and possibly dangerous-political ideal, a flawed social blueprint, or a thought experiment without any practical import. Even the "realistic utopias" of liberal theory strike many as wishful thinking. Can politics think utopia otherwise? Can utopian thinking contribute to the renewal of politics?In
      Political Uses of Utopia, an international cast of leading and emerging theorists agree that the uses of utopia for politics are multiple and nuanced and lie somewhere between-or, better yet, beyond-the mainstream caution against it and the conviction that another, better world ought to be possible. Representing a range of perspectives on the grand tradition of Western utopianism, which extends back half a millennium and perhaps as far as Plato, these essays are united in their interest in the relevance of utopianism to specific historical and contemporary political contexts. Featuring contributions from Miguel Abensour, Étienne Balibar, Raymond Geuss, and Jacques Rancière, among others,Political Uses of Utopiareopens the question of whether and how utopianism can inform political thinking and action today.<br>

                  recall—in derrida’s work there was “always a telephone.” It was just one of the technologies promising to annul distance, while calling into question the immediacy it promised and the distance it promised to annul.¹ Yet, as Eric Prenowitz writes, the telephone held a more peculiar interest: from “Plato’s Pharmacy,” through Derrida’s many reflections on teletechnologies (generalized inEchographies), to the ongoing dialogues with Hélène Cixous² that were also repeated openings to sexual difference. Consistent with those openings, the telephone becomes, at one point in hisThe Death Penalty, Volume 1, an umbilical cord. Here is Derrida describing teletechnology<br>

  Abstract: Among the many binary oppositions dividing planet cinema today, one as we have seen concerns the life or death of the medium. Some commentators, whom we might describe as pessimists, believe that cinema, or at least the cinema we knew in the twentieth century, has no future. They think its time has passed or at the very least that the changes to its identity that have taken place are so intense that it must be redefined. Some even believe that it is urgent that we give it a new name. This is not the first time the question what to<br>

  Abstract: The question of progress in the humanities is an ancient one. To offer a new answer, I suggest we compare the objects of humanistic inquiry to the objects of natural science. They are radically different. To show this, I use an unusual device: the magnifying lens. Using the magnifying lens, we can distinguish two types of object: one type (objects amenable to natural science) can sustain magnification; the other type (objects typical of humanistic inquiry) cannot. I demonstrate this thesis in two slide shows; the short version summarized above, and a longer version entitled “Magnification” on my web page.¹ These<br>

  Book Title: Broken Tablets-Levinas, Derrida, and the Literary Afterlife of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAMMERSCHLAG SARAH<br>
  Abstract: Over a span of thirty years, twentieth-century French philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida held a conversation across texts. Sharing a Jewish heritage and a background in phenomenology, both came to situate their work at the margins of philosophy, articulating this placement through religion and literature. Chronicling the interactions between these thinkers, Sarah Hammerschlag argues that the stakes in their respective positions were more than philosophical. They were also political. Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

  Abstract: Claude Lefort’s essay “Permanence of the Theologico-Political?” in answering the question as to why political philosophers in the modern era make recourse to theological language, suggests that democracy makes possible the identifiable sphere of the political as such through the very appearance of an empty place of sovereignty. As Lefort puts it, “The formula ‘power belongs to no one’ can also be translated into the formula ‘power belongs to none of us.’”¹ This itself generates the need for a symbolic register, a vacuum into which the religious enters, not necessarily as the guarantor of power itself but as a marker<br>

  Book Title: Reimagining the Sacred-Richard Kearney Debates God with James Wood, Catherine Keller, Charles Taylor, Julia Kristeva, Gianni Vattimo, Simon Critchley, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, David Tracey, Jens Zimmermann, and Merold Westphal<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER<br>
  Abstract: To respond to religion is to ask what religious behaviors and representations mean to us in our individual worlds, and scholars must confront questions of possibility and becoming that arise from testing their beliefs, imperatives, and practices. Roberts refers to the work of Hent de Vries, Eric Santner, and Stanley Cavell, each of whom exemplifies encounter and response in their writings as they traverse philosophy and religion to expose secular thinking to religious thought and practice. This approach highlights the resources religious discourse can offer to a fundamental reorientation of critical thought. In humanistic criticism after secularism, the lines separating the creative, the pious, and the critical themselves become the subject of question and experimentation.<br>

  Abstract: Shoulson is unconvinced of a direct link between a specific collection of rabbinic writings and Milton's works. He argues that many of Milton's poetic ideas that parallel midrash are likely to have entered Christian discourse not only through early modern Christian Hebraicists but also through Protestant writers and preachers without special knowledge of Hebrew. At the heart of Shoulson's inquiry lies a fundamental question: When is an idea, a theme, or an emphasis distinctively Judaic or Hebraic and when is it Christian? The difficulty in answering such questions reveals and highlights the fluid interaction between ostensibly Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian modes of thought not only during the early modern period but also early in time when rabbinic Judaism and Christianity began.<br>

  Abstract: Pondering the question of “style” in historiographical narration, Hannah Arendt notes: “The question of 
                  style is bound up with the problem of understanding which has plagued the historical sciences almost from their beginnings.”¹ What is the “style” of Arendt’s monumental Origins of Totalitarianism, the text we are primarily concerned with here? And how does its efficacy relate to the problem of understanding totalitarianism? In her response to political philosopher Eric Voegelin, one of the first reviewers of Origins, Arendt elaborates on her decision to, as it were, allocate more historiographical legitimacy to the valences of metaphorical thinking than to statistical<br>

  Abstract: Violent crime in popular entertainment is first and foremost a question of storytelling. On the most basic level, violence demands more story than does sex. Consider, for example, the extreme cases in popular entertainment directed at roughly the same demographic (men): in pornography, storytelling is kept to a minimum, since anything that is not overtly sexual is simply a distraction, and thus sex scenes can be strung together with the flimsiest of narrative threads (“Is that the delivery boy?”). In stories of violence, there is no precise narrative equivalent to pornography, as graphic violence tends to be much more motivated<br>

In the preceding two chapters we dealt with the question of the role to be assigned to reference and truth in (historical) representation. We found that representations cannot be said to refer to the world in the way proper names and sentences do, though they can be characterized as self-referential. Similarly, the notion of truth can meaningfully be used in the context of representation, not in the sense of propositional truth but in the quasi-Heideggerian sense of truth as a revelation of a past reality.

  Abstract: I have made much of the audacity of the trial as a narrative form in 
                  Pamela. It performs an impossible operation within the space of narrative: the suspension of the hermeneutic of happiness. According to the trial narrative, virtue can be proved only by one’s ability to ignore the question of happiness during a trial by adversity. Suffering, the trial narrative demands, must be viewed from the epistemological perspective of what it proves about us, and not from the existential perspective of whether it ruins our possibilities for happiness.

  Book Title: Cultural Performances in Medieval France-Essays in Honor of Nancy Freeman Regalado<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Burns E. Jane<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays pays tribute to Nancy Freeman Regalado, a ground-breaking scholar in the field of medieval French literature whose research has always pushed beyond disciplinary boundaries. The articles in the volume reflect the depth and diversity of her scholarship, as well as her collaborations with literary critics, philologists, historians, art historians, musicologists, and vocalists - in France, England, and the United States. Inspired by her most recent work, these twenty-four essays are tied together by a single question, rich in ramifications: how does performance shape our understanding of medieval and pre-modern literature and culture, whether the nature of that performance is visual, linguistic, theatrical, musical, religious, didactic, socio-political, or editorial? The studies presented here invite us to look afresh at the interrelationship of audience, author, text, and artifact, to imagine new ways of conceptualizing the creation, transmission, and reception of medieval literature, music, and art.

  Abstract: Why, indeed, is memory important in medieval romances? This question needs clarification given the many associations and definitions of such a complex cognitive faculty as memory, and the equally wide-ranging scope of this particular literary genre. We should begin by considering what exactly we mean by “memory,” which can be both individual, relating to the thought processes of a single remembering subject, and also collective. To take examples from the romance genre itself, a single knight might be trying desperately to maintain the memory of his love whilst away from home for many years. This is his individual memorial challenge.<br>

  Book Title: Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega-Masters of Parody<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KERR LINDSAY G.<br>
  Abstract: Co-Winner of the 2014 Publication Prize awarded by the Association of Hispanists of Great Britain and Ireland Kerr traces the processes and paradoxes at work in the late parodic poetry of Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega, illuminating the correlations and connections between two poets who have more often than not been presented as enemies.The analysis follows the parallel development of the complex parodic genre through Góngora's late mythological parody, from his 1589 Hero and Leander romance through to his culminating parody, La fábula de Píramo y Tisbe (1618) and Lope de Vega's alter ego Tomé de Burguillos, whose anthology, Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos, was published a year before Lope's death, in 1634. Working from the premise that parody provides a Derridean supplément to exhausted, dominant genres (e.g. pastoral, lyric, epic), this study asks: what do these texts achieve by their supplementarity, and how do they achieve it?, and, the overarching question, why do these erudite poets turn to parody in an age of decline?

These poets utilise parody as a process that, paradoxically, ends and begins simultaneously in order to engage with the literary past, question its legacy, and redirect future poetics. Góngora’s mytho-parodic trajectory and comic culmination, and Lope’s final theatrical extravaganza as Tomé de Burguillos, reveal a wealth of common practices.

  Book Title: The Civil Wars after 1660-Public Remembering in Late Stuart England<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Neufeld Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book examines the conflicting ways in which the civil wars and Interregnum were remembered, constructed and represented in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England. It argues that during the late Stuart period, public remembering of the English civil wars and Interregnum was not concerned with re-fighting the old struggle but rather with commending and justifying, or contesting and attacking, the Restoration settlements. After the return of King Charles II the political nation had to address the question of remembering and forgetting the recent conflict. The answer was to construct a polity grounded on remembering and scapegoating puritan politics and piety. The proscription of the puritan impulse enacted by the Restoration settlements was supported by a public memory of the 1640s and 1650s which was used to show that Dissenters could not, and should not, be trusted with power. Drawing upon the interdisciplinary field of social memory studies, this book offers a new perspective on the historical and political cultures of early modern England, and will be of significant interest to social, cultural and political historians as well as scholars working in memory studies. Matthew Neufeld is Lecturer in early modern British history at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.<br>

  Abstract: Public and community archaeologies clearly have their deepest roots in places characterised by structural, societal inequities, and in situations where archaeologists have sought to be inclusive. As such, community archaeology has been generally theorised within a postcolonial, post-processual framework whereby we as scholars and trained professionals question our own position and our right to talk about the past of ‘other people’, often disenfranchised people. As characterised by Gemma Tully, the principal rationale for community archaeology is that ‘better archaeology can be achieved when more diverse voices are involved in the interpretation of the past.’¹ The best of these new inclusive<br>

  Author(s): DORADO-OTERO ÁNGELA<br>
  Abstract: This book examines six Cuban novels published between 1991 and 1999, all part of the new "boom" of the Cuban novel in the 1990s. It analyses how in undermining monolithic representations of reality these texts employ discursive techniques that question absolute truths, defy established boundaries of literary genres and challenge concepts of national, gender and individual identity. The authors studied in this book---Reinaldo Arenas, Leonardo Padura Fuentes, Abilio Estévez, Daína Chaviano, Yanitzia Canetti, and Zoé Valdés---are placed beyond the dichotomy of outside and inside Cuba in order to focus on the fluidity and heterogeneity of Cuban culture displayed in its literature. This study establishes similarities and differences in the way these authors create polyphonic texts that question whether notions of country and nation coincide in novels that respond to economic hardship, political and social changes, issues of cubanía, and exile.

  Book Title: Spanish American Poetry after 1950-Beyond the Vanguard<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): SHAW DONALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a basis for understanding the main lines of development of poetry in Spanish America after Vanguardism, this volume begins with an overview of the situation at the mid-century: the later work of Neruda and Borges, the emergence of Paz. Consideration is then given to the decisive impact of Parra and the rise of colloquial poetry, politico-social poetry (Dalton, Cardenal) and representative figures such as Orozco, Pacheco and Cisneros. The aim is to establish a few paths through the largely unmapped jungle of Spanish American poetry in the time period. The author emphasises the persistence of a generally negative view of the human condition and the poets' exploration of different ways of responding to it. These vary from outright scepticism to the ideological, the religious or those derived from some degree of confidence in the creative imagination as cognitive. At the same time there is analysis of the evolving outlook on poetry of the writers in question, both in regard to its possible social role and in regard to diction.

  Abstract: ‘The reading invents the narrative no more than it is invented by it.’¹ This statement points to the balance existing between narrative and its reader, an area to be explored in this chapter. A story is useless without a reading while, without the story, there can be no reading and, consequently, no reader. Yet, unless a story captures its reader, it is quite likely that the reading will be prematurely ended, with the reader becoming bored and unwilling to continue being involved.

  Abstract: If, for twentieth-century writers, the question of authorship and its relationship to the authority of a ‘writing subject’ has posed considerable problems, then writing the life of the self – encapsulated perfectly, if in reverse order, in the very term auto-bio-graphy – makes these issues even more acute. The practice of autobiography necessarily confers on the autobiographical text an implied truth value upon which the weight of contemporary theory since existentialism and structuralism has cast considerable doubt. Unmoored from the Cartesian certainties of consciousness, contemporary autobiography stages an interplay between facts and imaginative creativity, replacing the original ‘confessional’ status of<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

As will be seen, there is a great difference between theoretical-methodological statements and historiographical practice. However, my purpose is not to blame the presumably “objective” historiography for “lack of objectivity” (especially since I do not believe in this ideal), but to see how things stand on particular issues of the “objectivity and truth” complex. Hence the account is somewhat fragmented. The question will also be posed: why were there, until recently, no relativizations of the<br>

  Abstract: In the domain of religion, the evidence of interactions between different beliefs and practices in the long sixteenth century is inescapable. Whether or not these interactions are part of the Renaissance movement is a more difficult and controversial question. However, the revival of antiquity, especially the “patristic revival” (the renewed interest in Augustine, Jerome and other leading figures of the early Church), was important in the history of Christianity in this period. The writings of the Fathers, which exemplify the Hellenization of Christianity, were influential on Catholics and Protestants alike.<br>

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur turns to Walzer’s work, then, not to move from a Rawlsian liberalism to communitarianism but to look at another question: that of the divisibility of principles of justice within a particular state. Again Ricoeur emphasizes the importance of political community. He thinks Walzer errs in viewing the question of politics solely as a question of the just distribution of political power since, in doing so, he fails to examine the status of the political community within which distributions proceed. Ricoeur acknowledges the attention Walzer pays to questions of membership in a political community. Still, he thinks that what Walzer’s work illuminates is “the uncomfortable situation of an entity called upon to behave at the same time as the whole and as the part, as the container and the contained, as inclusive agency and an included region” (p. 93). Rather than moving to a more communitarian view, then, Ricoeur accepts a modified version of Rawlsian liberalism: Rawls successfully constructs a single set of principles of justice, and we need only recognize that the grounds for this selection lie in our preexisting conception of the good rooted in our aspirations for meaningful lives and friendships within just institutions.<br>

Abstract: Examining culture in interaction helps us understand religious groups, too. For example, observers puzzle over the question of how Christianity and Islam (and other religions) can be used by terrorists and pacifists, fanatics and contemplative scholars, and casual observers alike. Previous explanations hinge on differences in interpretations of sacred texts—that is, different doctrinal standpoints, different beliefs about divine and earthly reality. Clearly, that is correct; certain branches of a religion highlight different chapters and verses of their sacred texts, and that explains many differences between members of the same religion. But we add another dimension to the question: an inspection of “culture in interaction” would ask if some of the differences between adherents of the same beliefs stem from different group styles.

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Abstract: By unfolding itself and making itself visible through the machine, Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body calls into question that which constitutes the primacy of the body itself, distinguishing it definitively from other objects. The body can’t be “a mere object of which he is conscious as he is of every other ‘thing’ in the world.” If so, he would have “embraced the position of the ‘pure subject’ who is a
         spectatorbefore the world and also before his own body which he considers as part of the world of objects.”55Because “in so far as it sees or touches the world, my body can therefore be neither seen nor touched. What prevents its ever being an object, ever being ‘completely constituted’ is that it is that by which there are objects. It is neither tangible nor visible in so far as it is that which sees and touches.”56Indeed, “I am not in front of my body, I am in it, or rather I am it.”57In other words, the perceiving body is always behind the perceived object, which is why my body “offers itself obstinately ‘from the same side’ without my being able to go around it.”58In a way we can say that Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body is registering in the same text as his speech; they both appear on the screen in front of him. Without this work of objectification of the body, Hawking cannot be his body. The body is felt but also represented as an exterior thing before it can do anything. With him the distinction between body‐object and body‐subject disappears. The human body conceived as a body‐object, that is, which “allows between its parts or between itself and other objects only external or mechanical relations” has become his own body or the body‐subject, that is, “‘his’ body as the center of ‘his’ existence, as the power both to act and to perceive and as a means for the subject to be part of the world.”59We thus see the movement of a certain form of absence‐presence that characterizes the body as Leder described it, but in another form. For Leder, the body is alway~<br>

Abstract: Defense of the Puritans against charges of political insubordination became particularly urgent as
      The History of the Puritansmoved into its longest and most difficult period: the reign of Charles I, culminating in civil war, the execution of the king, and the rule of Cromwell. Eighteenth‐century Dissenters were still living with the legal disabilities that followed from their assumed guilt for these events. And to legitimize their call for repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, they needed to question the dominant historical picture of these events. The bishop of London, Gibson, had commented to Zachary Grey in 1736 with some complacency, “surely neither he nor his friends can hope to gain credit to their cause, by a History of the State of Religion, and particularly the conduct of the Puritans, from 1642 to 1660.”33Neal moves into this period with some circumspection, but this is precisely his unavoidable aim: to go some way toward justifying the conduct of the Puritans in the civil war and under Cromwell.<br>

Abstract: Despite this, metaphysics has indeed replied (whether it should be allowed to or not) to the question concerning man’s definition of himself. And we know well that the Cartesian
         cogitohas no other importance than to assure theegoits comprehension of itself and thus to impose itself as the first principle of every other science. Nevertheless, it would be more fitting to doubt this vulgate of Cartesianism, because the texts of Descartes so often contradict it. Contradiction occurs first of all because theego’s very performance of its existence unfolds within a space that is, from the outset, dialogical (with theDeus qui potest omnia, with thegenius aliquis malignius).43Next, contradiction occurs because theegoof thecogitorecognizes that its finite thought culminates in a faculty of will that is paradoxically infinite, “ratione cujus imaginem quandam et similitudinem Dei me refere intelligo” (“in virtue of [which] … I understand myself to bear in some way the image and likeness of God”); and above all the common understanding of the comprehensibility of theegois contradicted because theegoidentifies its faculty of thinking of itself with the image and likeness of God within it, to the point that the faculty of self‐knowing is simply one with the faculty of knowing God: “ex hoc uno quod Deus me creavit, valde credibile est me quodammodo ad imaginem et similitudinem ejus factum esse, illamque similitudinem, in qua Dei idea continetur, a me precipi per eandem facultatem, per quam ego ipse a me percipior” (“but the mere fact that God created me is a very strong basis for believing that I am somehow made in his image and likeness and that I perceive that likeness, which includes the idea of God, by the same faculty which enables me to perceive myself”).44Let us consider this extraordinary text: founding the thinking of self upon my thinking of God, to the point of merging them within the space opened by the image of and likeness to God.

Abstract: Braudel addressed the critics directly in
            The Mediterranean,2d ed. (1972), 2:1243–44: “The question is frequently put to me, both by historians and philosophers, if we view history from such a distance, what becomes of man, his role in history, his freedom of action?” A classic example is embodied in Braudel’s portrait of Philip II himself. “What degree of freedom was possessed by Philip II, or by Don Juan of Austria as he rode at anchor among his ships, allies, and troops? Each of these so‐called freedoms seems to me to resemble a tiny island, almost a prison.” See the conclusion of Part III, 2:1236 that recounts the death of Philip II on September 13, 1598, based on three secondary sources of the 1920s, not from contemporary accounts of Philip’s “good death.” Braudel’s last poignant paragraph suggests that Philip did not know what he was doing: “[Philip] was not a man of vision: he saw his task as an unending succession of small details. Every one of his annotations is a small precise point, whether an order, a remark, or the correction of a spelling mistake or geographical error. Never do we find general notions or grand strategies under his pen.” The king’s “grand strategy,” however, is exactly what Geoffrey Parker set out to demonstrate inThe Grand Strategy of Philip II(New Haven, Conn., 1998). Braudel may be correct that Philip, as a prince, was not a student of geography. But what Philip did study, architecture, emphasized design. No discipline was more useful to understanding “general notions or grand strategies.” Thus, Braudel’s Part III, as traditional as it is often said to be, appears to get the story and the king wrong because Braudel’s steering assumption, not Philip II, was in control: “Good reasons for us to reflect once more on the distance separating biographical history from the history of structures, and even more from the history of geographical areas” (2:1237). For a similar critique, see also M. J. Rodríguez‐Salgado, “Dust and Ashe~<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: As mentioned above, it belongs to the very nature of apologetics to conceal the spirit of partisanship that motivates it. Apologetics makes the case for the superiority of its own truth claims to the extent that it succeeds in presenting objective standards of reason as the deciding factor. The successful apologetic argument, to borrow a simile from Heidegger, obliterates traces of its origins like a passageway that destroys itself. In this respect, apologetics is continuous with the classical theological project of demonstrating the fittingness of the contingent particulars of Christian faith such that these appear to follow logically from general theological principles. All theological rationalism seeks to overcome the raw contingency of the historical particulars of a tradition of faith. In the case of apologetics, however, there are aspects of today’s theological situation that render this concealment of contingency virtually impossible. A modern awareness of the limits of rationalism—two principal sources of which are the Marxist critique of ideology and the psychological concept of rationalization—renders it difficult to ignore the underlying interests determining the direction and shape of theological argument. Moreover, the modern explosion of knowledge of the history of religions has called into question the factual accuracy of many of the interreligious comparisons of traditional apologetics. Thus a postmodern awareness of the limits of reason together with new doubts about the validity of the objective comparisons of traditional apologetics have rendered transparent the underlying partisan motives of apologetic theology. Given the modern tendency to dichotomize the experiential and the sociopolitical aspects of religion and to relegate the latter to the realm of the profane, an apologetics with its partisan core thus exposed is apt to be rejected as a particularly distasteful form of theology. Thus doubts regarding the factual accuracy of its representati~<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: Where Meyers looks at images, McNay examines theorists: Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Paul Ricoeur, and Cornelius Castoriadis. In each case McNay lays out what she takes to be the merits of each writer’s views, while asking how the important step for feminists, from theory to action, is to be taken. And in each case the answer to this question is elusive. This is due in part to internal differences between the writers McNay considers. It is far from clear that Butler’s views on the body inform the same idea of agency as Ricoeur’s theory of narrative, for example, and as the text grows increasingly complex the very concept of agency seems to recede. This elusiveness is also partly due to the critique of theory itself. While striving to preserve the value in each competing view of subjectivity, McNay draws the reader’s attention to such serious drawbacks that one despairs for these theories altogether.<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur captures this dynamism, arguing that “narrative identity thus becomes the name of a problem at least as much as it is that of a solution” [
         30, p. 179]. In other words, there is a constant question to be answered: Who? We act on that question from the perspective of our position in history and culture, that is, from within the circle of interpretation, which can be construed as a world of action with temporality in the form of traditions, and ongoing practices in the form of fields of action [15].<br>

Abstract: My analysis of the pervasiveness of the race‐gender analogy raises the obvious question about whether it is possible to theorize race and gender in any way other than analogically. Has analogy been so powerfully deployed that we simply cannot escape it when we think of race and gender? To the extent that feminist theory—white or otherwise—refuses specificity, there is always a danger of analogizing. Take, for instance, Sandoval’s attempt to articulate an oppositional politics in
         Methodology of the Oppressed(2000). Although Sandoval critiques Haraway’s appropriation of the methodologies of women of color into examples of cyborg feminism (Sandoval2000, 71), her book remains indebted to Haraway’s construction of the cyborg as a generalized locus of difference and contradiction. Perhaps that is why the predominant mode of analysis inMethodology of the Oppressedis analogizing different forms of dissident consciousness, such as Roland Barthes’s punctum (a meaning that cannot be named, because it is not part of a collective code; Barthes1981, 27), Anzaldúa’smestizaje(mixture, hybrid; Anzaldúa1987), and Haraway’s cyborg feminism. While it might well be important to demonstrate the undeniable structural similarities among these concepts, the very methodology of generalization and analogy might blind us to problems apparent only through localized readings. For instance, to bypass the reading of Anzaldúa’smestizajein the context of Mexico, where it was the official policy of amalgamation and adopted in order to disempower black races, is to miss the crucial contradiction here between progressive feminism and hegemonic racial hierarchies.15<br>

Abstract: I say “reconfigured strategically” to avoid the impression that my attempt to reconfigure the dialectic of comparative theology and theology of religions as a politically liberating praxis excludes the more elite discourses of the religious traditions involved (such as those of India’s Brahmins and China’s Confucian elites), which are in many cases both hegemonic (within a particular cultural framework) and marginalized (within a larger or global context). The solidary praxis of restoring and enabling subaltern religious representations is aimed at establishing participatory parity as a political reality in which both subaltern and elite representations could take part as decentered centers that are all other to one another and no longer as subaltern or elite in terms of sociopolitical and cultural hegemony. To bring into being such a politically level playing field, in which the more elite discourses find themselves also liberated and with a new voice, I think it is strategically necessary to emphasize first an act of solidarity with the oppressed. I thank the anonymous reviewer of my essay for raising the question of my thesis’s possible exclusion of elite religious discourses.<br>

Abstract: Frei highlights several crucial features of Phillips’s views: first, the meaning of religious language is grounded in the way of life and practice of the believer—the language therefore takes on a meaning incommensurable with the ways that a philosopher (or a believer in a different faith tradition) would understand it. Second, because of this incommensurability, the work of philosophy can only be to clarify the distinction between different uses of language; it is only from within the terms and practices of a community that one can judge one use of language to be “better” than another, and this judgment is made solely through practice. In Frei’s view, Phillips effectively effaces the possibility of Christian self‐description that would explain why one formulation of doctrine is better than another, by “absolutizing and rigidifying the warranted, indeed essential, distinction between religious statements and statements about religion.”
         32This effaces the possibility of self‐description because the best way to understand—perhaps, really, the only way to understand—is through deeper practice. It is, in a sense, as if upon expressing incomprehension regarding the incarnation, one were told to simply pray harder. The hard and fast distinction between religious utterances and statements about religion leads, on Frei’s view, to the collapse of the distinction between second‐order and first‐order religious statements. There is no logic that could explain the statements—not even to the community itself. Theology is reduced to “parroting” traditional statements: “I wanted to raise the question whether this procedure and this conviction didn’t mean that the theologian could do no more than repeat without conceptually redescribing the words of doctrines or scriptural statements that had doctrinal overtones and aftereffects.”33Frei’s fear is not that explanations come to an end, but rather that Phillips’s radically Wittgensteinian position means that explanations never~<br>

Abstract: “Citatology” nearly always ignores this question, implicitly treating references to an author as an index of recognition (of indebtedness or legitimacy). In point of fact this apparent function may nearly always be associated with such diverse functions as the manifestation of relations of allegiance or dependence, of strategies of affiliation, of annexation or of defence (this is the role, for example, of guarantee references, ostentatious references or alibi‐references).<br>

Abstract: Though Halbwachs’s sociological theories about religious collective memory were driven by the primacy of place, then, they apply equally well when the site is imagined—when Mrs. Barrett’s Midwestern students are praying for the people of New York under siege. And while the theoretical exemplar of Halbwachs’s
         cadre sociauxmay be as distant in memory as the Jewish sites of historical import were to the New Christians, Halbwachs’s theory holds up when the events are immediate in time, lived in the present, and technologically replicated, as were the collapsing World Trade Towers on September 11. Only Halbwachs’s certainty in the “ultimate opposition of history and memory” (Hutton1993, 78) is challenged by the case of Mrs. Barrett’s class, or at least called into question. For, indeed, in the world of Eternal Grace, no history—no event or class of events—stands outside of religious collective memory. History and religion are one and the same, as are instruction in history and instruction in religion. In terms of teaching history or understanding unfolding events, the ramifications of this kind of conviction are profound. This religious collective memory, after all, frames how students conceive of themselves as agents in history, citizens in a democracy, and actors in the world.<br>

Abstract: The question is, What criteria does the judge apply in reaching his verdict? I believe that there are two: a theoretical and a practical criterion. Both these criteria are fraught with problems, but I confine myself to just one of these. The theoretical criterion has to do with the striving for truth, where one must distinguish between truth claims and regimes of truth.
            56Religions quite rightly present truth claims, but any claim to possessing the truth, which is typical of exclusivism and inclusivism, is an obstruction to interreligious dialogue, if not to truth itself. Hence I cannot see how one can (want to) achieve interreligious dialogue from an exclusivist or inclusivist position. Striving for truth in dialogue of any kind is difficult enough in itself.<br>

Abstract: Yet, while this site cannot become one of collective experience, let alone collective memory, by subjecting it to this analysis I am dealing with it as a historical fact or place. In a different context, Susan Crane asked: “When is the personal historical?” She replied to her own question: “Whenever one is thinking about oneself historically.”
         98Crane herself was concerned primarily with the nature of historical consciousness as perceiving individually but signifying collectively and with the fine line running between autobiography and historiography. By both looking at myself as a historian describing and reflecting on a certain period and approaching myself as an agent of this period who is utilizing my own living memory as a historical source, I inevitably make some of the personal historical. For the duration of this text, at least, even the pharmacy assumes some historical meaning—metaphorically embodying, with its makeover from medical to clothing store, and with the physical although not functional presence of its former designation, the complex story of rupture and continuity between the Communist and post‐Communist era.<br>

Abstract: The question remains how consideration of childhood may or should in turn transform theological ethics. Here, one might say, is the disciplinary pay‐off, the chance to rethink ethical methods and norms so as to reimagine not only childhood but also ethics itself. There are many possible ways in which this might happen. At a minimum, including childhood challenges theological ethics to involve a greater sense of what I call
         creative responsibility.45Such a norm mirrors substantively what I have been arguing for methodologically. Childhood shows in the strongest possible terms that human beings are responsible for one another. But it also presses ordinary understandings of moral responsibility toward their radically creative dimensions, dimensions in which those responsible are called to the decentering, disruption, and asymmetrical transformation of their assumed moral horizons. Beyond closely related feminist and liberationist norms of inclusive participation, what may be called a “childist” theological ethics requires the ever new creation of one's own moral worlds in a way inclusively responsive to others.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In this chapter, Ricoeur displays an artful capacity to inspire the ongoing research on recognition. Many contemporary thinkers have chosen to shun the troubling question of “What is it that must be recognized?” with something akin to an institutional approach: the answer would not lie in discovering the essence of recognition but, instead, in finding a creative approach to the negotiation of recognition claims. This approach is clearly the one preferred in the defense of multiculturalism. For instance, Will Kymlicka emphasizes the design of fair “structures of culture” that are distinguished from substantial “characters of culture” (Will Kymlicka,
      Liberalism, Community, and Culture[New York: Clarendon, 1989], 167). The idea behind this separation of political from more substantive problems is, most of the time, congruent with considerations about the pluralism of worldviews and the public role of philosophy. Yet this approach, however sound it may be, has displaced deep conflicts in the hands of institutional “designs” that are guided by the need for immediate results, which are likely to shade important issues.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The foregoing is certainly not an exhaustive list of the elements of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship. No one person can pretend to suggest an all‐inclusive set of elements. The question to be faced is, How do we, as public professionals, address the need for a more comprehensive consideration of ethics? The answer to this question grows out of the rights‐based premises upon which this article is based. As a public profession, librarianship is committed to a democratic form of public polity. An essential part of the democratic way of being is deliberation, especially public deliberation. Among the many ways we can define democracy is by aggregative or deliberative means. An aggregative position assumes that collective preferences are given; that is, the preferences are taken to be legitimated so that no further justification is required. Invocation of the LBR or ALA’s Code of Ethics as immutable dogmas of the profession may be indicative of an aggregative definition of democracy. The principal shortcoming of this stance is that challenge of taken‐for‐granted preferences is very difficult and meets with tenacious resistance. An alternative—deliberative democracy—admits to pluralism of preferences and of participants.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: In many ways Koselleck’s conception of historical practice as the distinct marker of “new time”—modernity—was produced by an intense philosophic discussion throughout the first half of the twentieth century. Much of this discussion was driven by new scientific discoveries, theorizations of time, and the perception that modern society, constituted by a combination of capitalism and technology, was increasingly being directed by quantitative and objective forms of measurement and the regime of calendar and clock time. The major participants in this discussion, which Heidegger described as a “reckoning with time,” were Bergson, who probably inaugurated it by internalizing the flux of time and envisaging the possibility of coexisting mixed temporalities; Husserl, who explored further the internal recesses of psychological time and provided a dematerialized version of the lived everyday in an abstracted lifeworld; Simmel, who explicitly linked the new urban metropolis to the psychological interiorization of the state of time; Lukács, whose critique politicized a philosophy devoted to the exemplar of science and objective and quantitative measurement; and others who would not have always wanted to be classified with each other even though they shared an interest in addressing some common themes. But what seemed to hold this discussion together was the effort to rescue qualitative time and to evaluate the status of immediate experience. In many cases, this move led to an internalization, a dematerialization and dehistoricization of time, as well as, on the one hand, a distancing from the external world of clock and calendar and on the other hand important attempts to reconfigure the relationship between quantitative and qualitative time. It meant also upholding the proposition that things occur not simply in time, as such, but
         throughit, thereby opening up the possibility of shifting from measurement and perspectivalism to agency, actualization, and aspectivism.15~<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Rao, following Śaṅkara, reconciles the immutability of brahman with the nondifference (
            ananyatva) of brahman and the world—and hence the affirmation of the reality of the world—by effectively denying what Aristotle would call “substantial change.” Change occurs only with respect to the accidental “features,” the “names and forms,” of things (see “Two Myths in Advaita,” 266, 275). Rao’s analysis, based as it is on a denial of substantial change, simply begs the question: is the world we know—that is, as constituted by name and form—unreal for Śaṅkara? Thus, the thesis that Śaṅkara affirmed the reality of this world holds only as long as one accepts a rather counterintuitive concept of “the world.” The uncertainty and ambiguity concerning the question of whether Śaṅkara denied the world is simply displaced to the question of how one describes the world.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: This book is based on Don Browning’s most recent work on the relation of Christian ethics and the moral psychologies—a plural that the author uses in order to indicate the pluralist nature of this academic field. Browning states his guiding question as follows: should “moral theologians critique these psychologies and perhaps cleanse both theology and the wider culture of the possible mistaken images of moral responsibility proffered by them?” His “brief answer” is that “
      contemporary moral psychology can contribute to Christian ethics, but only when it does its research with competent pre‐scientific or pre‐empirical understandings of morality”(2). Accordingly, Browning’s special interest refers to the understandings of morality that research presupposes. It is these preunderstandings that require critical analysis by, among others, theologians. The model that Browning uses in his analysis is an adaptation of Paul Ricoeur’s critical hermeneutical ethics. This ethics combines hermeneutical sensitivity to different cultural and religious traditions with a critical point of view informed by, among others, the social sciences and philosophical ethics. It gives due attention to particular visions of the good life and of the “status of humans” (10) without losing touch with the claims of universalist ethical criteria (“the deontological test” [52]). It may also be called “antifoundationalist” in that it begins with history and moral tradition rather than with empirical research as a supposedly objective basis.<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: It is important to clarify at this point that the historicism we espouse is strictly a methodology to preserve the historical record. As stated above, the historicism we are advocating is founded upon the works of Johann Gottfried von Herder. We see in his reflections on mankind’s intellectual development a way to avoid the question of objective truth in librarianship for the sake of historical comprehension. It is very similar to Descartes suspending the truth value of the propositions of his beliefs in order to arrive at epistemological certainty. Our suspension of truth value does not arrive at epistemological certainty about the propositions contained in the many volumes housed in a library but rather at certainty that the historical record has not been compromised by the elimination of any these volumes. In other words, librarians must suspend the truth value of singular items and artifacts in the historical record in order that the whole truth of any given period of history be accurately analyzed and understood. As Herder states: “If history in its simplest sense were nothing but a description of an occurrence, of a production, then the first requirement is that the description be
         whole, exhaust the subject, show it to use from all sides” [74].<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: By contrast with its culminating evasions, Dickens's novel has begun on the level playing field of the genre. Ethics and epistemology are closely correlated at first in the hero's most pressing question: who has been wronged by my family, what guilt induced by my class station and inheritance? The question, however, does not survive the suppression of its eventual answer. It is gagged once and for all—and bound back into marital closure. For most of Dickens's story, the hero has been searching in the dank basement of his estranged domesticity for an incriminating family secret. As it turns out, that secret is the hero himself, his denied status as stepson the site of the crime. Clennam always felt guilty for not loving his mother and especially for not being loved by her. Now he needn't, because she isn't. But the secret of his birth, mitigating his ingrained sense of worthlessness in the eyes of the false mother, is leaked by narration only to be reabsorbed by characterization within the situational ethics of special pleading, spared shame, and the heroine's own perhaps incompletely examined motives.<br>

Abstract: In light of this discussion, we may now go back to the question that introduced the foregoing arguments. Where does the soul of Joseph Le Doux’s mother go when it leaves the body? My soft‐transcendental answer, Proustian in nature, is that it goes, or more exactly it remains, where it should be in the first place, namely, in the organismic memory that mourning “injects in [her son’s] blood stream.” It is the embodied token of his self’s altruistic identification in the loved one.<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine helps to shed light on these insights. Note that connections between the ethics of war and memory are intimate indeed, joined at the outset in his discussion of Christianity and political morality in the
         City of God. That work is, among other things, an argument about how to remember the fall of Rome and whether Rome’s decline should be understood as a consequence of embracing Christianity’s putatively pacific virtues. According to Augustine, we must understand that Christianity is not a pacifist creed; it allows for the use of force to defend certain goods. Equally important in Augustine’s mind is the need to remember the true reasons for Rome’s fall: its ongoing pagan sacrifices subsequent to its official conversion to Christian doctrine. This aspect of Augustine’s thought has been universally ignored by theologians and philosophers who have worked in the just‐war tradition. But we should not lose sight of what could be his most striking contribution to the ethics of war and peace. Often overlooked by readers of Augustine is the fact that he is defending the idea of a just war in response to criticisms about the political and cultural effects of accepting Christianity’s moral norms. Thus, he queries at the outset of his magnum opus: “Why do our antagonists bring false accusations against the established Christian order, alleging that catastrophe has come upon the city just because it has left off the worship of its gods?”81With that question in the background, Augustine seeks to absolve Christianity for Rome’s demise. On his account, Rome’s decline should not be remembered as a result of its conversion from Roman religion to Christian beliefs and practices. That argument is part of a larger agenda regarding the civic benefits of the Christian religion along with the core features of its political ethic.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Again, all of these—and much, much more—form the structures and dynamics within which people dwell and that pose the basic question of how we can and ought to orient life. What then is the aim of intellectual labor? How can knowledge grow so that life might increase, especially in our age when so many forms of life and cultural forms are endangered? Is it possible to rejuvenate the humanities and to probe the religions in order to envision a new self‐overcoming of human power and knowledge into responsibility for the integrity of life within the complexity of the world? That is the work of humanizing religion.<br>

Abstract: Such diversity inevitably generates interpretive contradictions and makes the author's stated goals—to compare the films' thematic content and form with those of the colonial cinema that preceded it and to use postcolonial film as a barometer for assessing how French collective memory has come to terms with its imperialist history—difficult to achieve. While Eades's painstaking analysis of the continuities and ruptures between colonial and postcolonial cinema is impressive, her contention that the latter “forced recognition of a reality grudgingly accepted by political authorities and the general population” (22) until the mid‐1990s and “called into question imperial ideology in all its dimensions” (203) is less convincing. While the majority of these films do at some level acknowledge the failures and abuses of French imperialism, most also avoid explicit reference to controversial issues and events (most notably, the French army's practice of torture in Algeria) and ignore the subjective experience of colonized peoples, highlighting instead the plight of colonizers caught in morally untenable situations because of the corrupt system that surrounds them. The result, as Eades recognizes, is that the colonized tend to remain little more than stereotypes while audiences are encouraged to identify with the European perspective. In so doing, postcolonial cinema implicitly perpetuates the epistemological prejudices of overtly imperialist films from the 1920s and 1930s.<br>

Abstract: The prospect of the decline of those debates in a media studies milieu is more worrisome than the putative mutation of their topic. For our seasoned ability to understand how the movies have functioned and to question how they came to function this way can guide the study of whatever audio‐visions attract our attention.
         65The fact is that many of the best minds in the humanities turned from literary, philosophical, sociocultural, or historical pursuits to account for the most imposing medium of the twentieth century. They produced often complex, ingenious, and passionate arguments and positions. They produced a way of thinking and cultivated an instinct of looking and listening. Even if much of what has been written could be discarded without real loss, this discourse—this drive to understand the workings of films—is precious. To have this subsumed by some larger notion of the history of audio‐visions, to have it dissipate into the foggy field of cultural studies, for instance, or become one testing ground among others for communication studies would be to lose something whose value has always derived from the intensity and the focus that films invite and often demand.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Now, Derrida holds that Marion has elided the distinction between praise and prayer, which represent two nominally separable traits. For Derrida, the only language that truly respects distance is, in a formulation that recalls Kant, pure prayer, or the “act of addressing oneself to the other as other.”
         57However, praise, or encomium—even “praise as”—violates the purity of this first trait by compromising the absolute alterity of the Other and bringing reference to bear across address. Thus, “the encomium qualifies God, anddeterminesprayer,determinesthe other.”58Marion held that “praise as” did not attempt to qualify or determine God, but Derrida argues that it “entails a predicative aim, however foreign it may be the ‘normal’ ontological predication.”59However, there is no real question of being able to pray without encomium, for “there would be no prayer … [without] writing, the code, repetition.”60The letter of the prayer, as in Kant, is always impure: how do you address the Other without determining who the addressee is? True prayer is actually impossible. As Hent de Vries puts it, “Prayer is from the outset and forever divided in and against itself.”61<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: The studies under review represent significant revisions to the narrative of secularization. Their point of departure, as this essay has argued, is Enlightenment-era reactions to the inaccessibility of a radically transcendent, hidden God. By investing temporal concepts and institutions with new meanings that approximated religion's function of legitimizing human existence, eighteenth-century philosophers and theologians made the imperatives of the temporal sphere as binding as divine hierarchies once had been. Of course, the operative elements of this process varied, depending on the monograph in question: for Bell and Sepinwall, it was the regeneration of the nation-state and its inhabitants; for Sutcliffe, it was the Enlightenment's efforts to transcend Judaism; for Sheehan, it was the translation and repackaging of Scripture; for Dupré, it was the human person's emergence as the fundamental source of meaning. Yet each of these scholars insists that religious culture had a decisive influence on the formation of “secular” ideals and institutions. Enlightenment and religion, so long regarded as antithetical to each other, are now viewed as overlapping and interdependent agents of historical change.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: The decisive question remains: what is promised? What offered gift can we take as the token‐as‐promise among the wealth of signs and givens that wash through the world? Owing to his view of prophetic criticism, Tillich claimed that yesterday’s prophetic act may be in need of revision and criticism today. This means that few or no signs may be taken as offered tokens. However, it would not be the case, he thinks, that Protestantism simply would carry out a sort of semiotic iconoclasm, wringing its hands, worried that every sign in the world is always a failing. Interestingly, at the end of his essay he turns to the congregation, and there we may find some ways to construe the prophetic as sign of the cross. Tillich does not develop what he calls the protestant form of grace, a chastened form that would dissent in his view from the objectification of what he calls Catholicism. Of course, this is a severely limited judgment on Tillich’s part, since there are many vibrant accounts of the Eucharist—Catholic and Protestant—together with their practical and political significance that are deeply marked by the same engagements and imperatives that Tillich raised.
         46These senses of Eucharist still would benefit from reflection on promise, and its local form in the congregation makes better sense when it is framed by the Eucharist as site of promise, gift, exchange, and free reciprocity. Eucharist, briefly, invokes the character of promise as the offering of Jesus’s testament as well as a mutual action that is both communion as exchange between God and creation as well as in and amid creation. It would not take much to think through the Eucharist as the liturgical action and embodiment of promise, to reconsider it and its practice toward being otherwise than sovereign, as I have written here. Suffice it to note that the Eucharist is a meal of betrayal, as theVerbaalways announce: “On the night in which he was betrayed.”<br>

Abstract: If indeed the letter to Malka was meant to prod Lévinas, to push him to recognize the inconsistency in his own thought, we might ask after the remedy. How could Lévinas disclose the Jewish message in the world and simultaneously disown it? One answer to this question is that he could not, neither on philosophical nor political grounds, for that would require a disavowal of both his philosophical and political commitments. Blanchot, however, as a literary critic and a thinker with profoundly different political aims, will accomplish this task for him. He thus exposes Lévinas to a reading that capitalizes on both the tensions in Lévinas's own work and the more radical demands implied by his philosophy of deracination. To do so he transforms Lévinas's philosophy into its literary double.<br>

Author(s): Bono James J.<br>
Abstract: If, as I have suggested, literature and science shares with the history of science a concern to understand the making of science—that is, the making of the different forms of knowledge of things and events in nature—through attentive focus on scientific practice(s) as performative, then we should ask how the distinctive ways in which each field contributes to an understanding of the making of science might lead to fruitful convergences and interdependencies. The essays that follow contribute to this goal. Crucial here, I would argue, is a fundamental question: How does the analysis of literary and linguistic dimensions of scientific practice and communication map onto the preoccupations of historians of science with the material practices of scientists? What this question in turn reveals is an abiding, if false, dichotomy: that between discourse and (material) practice or, to put it differently, between text and action.<br>

Abstract: Kafka himself brings up yet another corollary: “An appendix to this story has also been handed down. Ulysses, it is said, was so full of guile, was such a fox, that not even the goddess of fate could penetrate his inner self. Perhaps he had really noticed, although it is beyond human understanding, that the Sirens were silent and perhaps somehow opposed them and the gods using the aforementioned sham as a shield.”
   
            Why not? Why should it not be the case that, ultimately, Augustine, while confessing uninterruptedly, has succeeded in having his Confessee not penetrate his heart? Who can tell? Once in the grasp of the seductive act of24
         confessioas inextricably linked to the moment the confession is made and to the everlasting Confessee hovering over it, who indeed can tell? An angel to an angel? Yet this question regards the fullness of sound: “Only you can be asked, only you can be begged, only on your door can we knock. Yes, indeed, that is how it is received, how it is found, how the door is opened.”

Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: A final example is that of the “leper” described in Leviticus 13–14. Leaving aside the vexed question of the medical identification of this disease, the ostracization of the leper is strongly reminiscent of measures taken to avoid the spread of infection:
         
               Despite the fact that the text makes no allusion to the possibility of infection, the requirement that the leper warn others of his condition and his isolation from the camp suggests a fear of contagion. The banishment of the leper is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Numbers 5:2–5; 12:14; 2 Kings 7:3–10), including non-Priestly texts, and this would seem to reflect actual practice. Moreover, the requirement to cover the mustache (or upper lip) of the leper has been explained as reflecting the fear that he would spread his condition through his breath.The leper who has the affliction: his clothes shall be torn, his hair shall be disheveled, he shall cover his moustache and call out: ‘Impure, impure!’ He shall be impure for all of the days that the affliction is upon him. He is impure. He shall dwell alone. His dwelling shall be outside the camp (Leviticus 13:45–46).
            
               This interpretation finds support among interpreters of the Second Temple Period who warned against being downwind of the leper, which correlates suggestively with the fact that actual leprosy (Hansen’s disease) is contracted via the respiratory system.73

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673367<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: In these lines, we might find the rudiments of an early modern rationale for Levinas’s claim that
         autruiis always and only human. Perplexed by his anthropocentric stance, several of Levinas’s critics have asked why the “I” is not also ordained by the alterity of animals, or even plants. Though Levinas answers religiously (the human other bears “the trace of God,” whereas plants and animals do not), the human exceptionalism established in Lear’s speech is different. As Laurie Shannon has shown, it is a negative exceptionalism, predicated upon the underprovisioned condition of humankind. Whereas nonhuman animals are naturally “coated,” the human creature Lear considers is uniquely naked, compelled to case himself in secondhand skins, or “lendings.” Given Levinas’s insistence on the essential nudity ofautrui, Lear’s vision of “unaccommodated man” seems relevant. As Shannon remarks, the “poor, bare, forked animal” we are made to see in the play raises the question of whether any animal other than the human may fairly be deemed “naked.” See Laurie Shannon, “Poor, Bare, Forked: Animal Sovereignty, Human Negative Exceptionalism, and the Natural History ofKing Lear,”Shakespeare Quarterly60 (2009): 168–96.<br>

Abstract: This does not exclude critique. Conflicts and contesting claims have very often served as triggers for the production of alternate narratives. History, then, would never come in the singular
         
               and tends to be contested and endangered. Like memory it has to be studied as a social and communicative enterprise.35
            
               Critically, from the start on, history—as opposed to mere memory—introduces contingency in order to question the established truths of others. To introduce competition into the legitimizing repository of the past is a powerful instrument, but risky. Thus, some epochs and some cultural realms are more open to historiography than others. Religion in particular does not seem a very likely candidate for history. To the contrary, metahistorical claims, gods outside time and immune against change, that is, traditional authority in a Weberian sense seem to be the hallmarks of religion. Frequently myths tell stories of a distant past that establish binding norms despite the fact that this past is categorically different from today, but yet binding based on this fact. Without the help of emic narratives, it seems difficult to narrate a history for a system of rituals.36
            
               Georg Wissowa’s famous handbook37
            Religion und Kultus der Römertried to build a description of Roman religion on a purely systematic reading of Varro’sAntiquitates.
               A polytheist religion, an embedded religion of a city in particular, is an unlikely example for a strategy that seems typical at best for monotheistic, prophetic religion comprising a theology of a history of salvation. Thus, identifying ancient attempts at giving a history to religion would be momentous.38<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Hanford, whose edition I cite, clearly segregates the three intersecting voices through his use of double and single quotation marks. But do these marks adequately reflect what happens in this climactic scene? Stanley Fish describes it: “‘Tempt not the Lord thy God; he said.’ Who said? The Son, of course, since the sounds issue from his mouth, but the words are not his…except in the sense that he has identified himself with their speaker. It is not that he appropriates the words, but that they, and their source, appropriate him.”
         
               The great critical question about these two lines is whether, when Jesus says “Tempt not the Lord thy God,” he simply means the Father or whether he now understands his true identity and is essentially telling Satan, “don’t tempt me.”43
            
               Fish’s reading is helpful because it redirects the thorny theological questions of substance, essence, and consubstantiation to the simpler question of quotation. The Son is able to speak the words of the Father so selflessly that he merges with the divine source, becoming the Word of God. We might say that Jesus begins the sentence in quotation marks but that the Son concludes them in his own voice—just as Adam begins speaking the words of Satan only to discover that they are unfortunately his own. In both cases, Milton demands something beyond the powers of our everyday typographical equipment. What we need in such instances is a mark to signify diminishing quotation—the process whereby words attributed to another gradually become, in the act of enunciation, the speaker’s own. If44
            Paradise Lostillustrates how easily this may happen in the case of satanic speech,Paradise Regainedoffers the possibility that it can work in the opposite direction. When the Son speaks, the divisive quotes miraculously slip away as the human and the divine merge in the space of a single utterance. This is the nature of real union with God on the poem: you start qu~<br>

Abstract: If Terry Eagleton is right when he suggests that “for the radical, the real monsters are ourselves,”
         
               then the task of diagnosing the multiple flows of power with which the church is confronted at “the end of history” must be accompanied by a renewed analysis of the ways in which the church itself is the product of these very powers. Going beyond Badiou, this means cultivating an awareness that if the ecclesia is truly to be itself in today’s world, instead of hovering on the margins to keep itself pure, it should rather realize that its proclamation of the lordship of Christ depends on a network of complex relationships. That means that, far from seeking uniformity and discipline, disagreement can be welcome and even the authorities can vulnerably put themselves in question. In brief, the church must become “a site of contestation” rather than the “custodian of the fundamentals,” a place that is hospitable to conflict and crisis rather than an institution searching, at any cost, for some kernel of unity upon which differing sides can easily agree and move forward.176

Abstract: Given the disorder of the final scene, it is hardly surprising that the onstage audience, the Duke, fails to understand the play. At one point he asks, “What’s the conceit of that?” (5.1.157). Caught up in the play, the Duke seeks artistic interpretation, the “conceit,” not criminal explanation of the deaths he witnesses. His question indicates the failure of the masque to make sense out of the suffering the Duke mistakenly thinks is part of the tragic script. Offstage audiences, however, have a larger play-text to draw from when trying to parse the significance of this violence. Hippolyto’s metaphors of fire connect his pain with earlier moments in the play’s exploration of familial relationships and corporeal identity. Astute listeners will remember that in act 4, Hippolyto railed against his sister Livia’s affair with Leantio, saying that his zeal to put an end to her relationship with someone below his family’s class “Puts fire into my blood” (4.2.14). The fire metaphor of the final scene recalls this motif of “fire in the blood” and frames his physical suffering within a larger tragic structure. Fittingly for a revenge plot, Hippolyto is brought down in a manner that references his own character traits.<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Abstract: William Paul Simmons and Edward Finley, in their respective essays, “Voegelin and Levinas” and “Politics, Metaphysics, and Anti-Foundationalism,” compare Voegelin's, Levinas', and Patočka's philosophies in the recovery of transcendence. For Simmons, both Voegelin and Levinas recognize transcendence as a guide instead of a foundation. For the former, politics and ethics are justified “from the individual's existential participation in the
         metaxy,” while for the latter, “Politics must answer to ethics” (139). Patočka and Voegelin also accept transcendence into their politics, but they approach transcendence in different ways: Patočka employs postmodern techniques, “negative Platoism,” to reject metaphysical thinking, while Voegelin adopts a classical approach for understanding Plato. Although both Simmons and Findley provide an excellent delineation of the differences among these thinkers, they leave open the question of which approach—Voegelin's, Levinas', or Patočka's—is the best way to recover a meaning of transcendence for society.<br>

Abstract: To literalize this simile, one may use Jakobson’s well-known formalist thesis, with its delimitation of the specificity of poetic language as projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination: “What is the empirical linguistic criterion of the poetic function? In particular, what is the indispensable feature inherent in any piece of poetry? To answer this question we must recall the two basic modes of arrangement used in verbal behavior,
            selectionandcombination…The selection is produced on the base of equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity, synonymity and antonymity, while the combination, the build up of sequences, is based on contiguity.The poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination.Equivalence is promoted to the constitutive device of the sequence. In poetry one syllable is equalized with any other syllable of the same sequence; word stress is assumed to equal word stress, as unstress equals unstress; prosodic long is matched with long, and short with short; word boundary equals word boundary, no boundary equals no boundary; syntactic pause equals syntactic pause, no pause equals no pause. Syllables are converted into units of measure and so are morae or stresses” (Jakobson 1960, 357).<br>

Abstract: Wu argues that a “fundamental logic” underlies the structure of burials (219), and that only by uncovering this logic can we truly understand Chinese tombs. This thesis is reflected in Wu’s decision to arrange the book thematically into chapters that represent what he considers the “three most essential aspects of any manufactured work”: spatiality, materiality, and temporality (14). Because he is not bound by the same constraints that accompany the more traditional chronological and individual approaches to studying tombs, Wu is able to draw freely from a large, albeit fragmented, body of material and textual evidence to support his points. A major strength of this book may also be perceived as a weakness: Wu seems to be able to offer explanations for practically all the visual phenomena in tombs. One may question the reliability of such a comprehensive explanation for such an enormous amount of information.<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Abstract: On enigma as a rhetorical figure: a brief history in the rhetoricians, encyclopedists, and patristic commentators from Aristotle to Dante's time, with a rhetorical analysis of the figure. Special attention is given to Augustine in the
         De trinitateXV on St. Paul's well-known "in aenigmate" (I Cor.13:12). Some implications of Augustine's linking of the figurative and the figural (typological, historical) are considered, with a re-examination of Auerbach's "Figura" on this question. The importance for our own reading of rhetoric in relation to history and poetry is stressed.<br>

Author(s): Bernasconi Oriana<br>
Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Abstract: The numerous changes and improvements which have been wrought in teacher education courses in the last two decades have not, apparently, satisfied the critics. Ironically, the reverse seems to have occurred, as recent events on both sides of the Atlantic testify. This essay argues that the developments of the last two decades in educational research and teacher education, which have yielded a wealth of new ideas and procedures, have also yielded a confusing proliferation of educational ideologies. In short, it suggests that the ascendancy of a diffuse, unselfcritical, and often combative discourse within educational studies has effectively eclipsed the more important question which must first be tackled if educational studies are to have a coherent, robust focus. This question, which is pursued in the second section of the paper, asks: is the educational enterprise, properly conceived, a distinctive, autonomous or sui generis enterprise with purposes of its own which are universal, or is it essentially a subservient enterprise, a vehicle for one or other currently prevailing ideology (cultural, technological, political, religious, etc.)? In exploring this question the essay puts to work some enduring insights from contemporary European philosophy, arguing that education as a 'practical hermeneutic discipline' holds a singular promise. Some important consequences of this promise for educational studies and teacher education are then considered.<br>

Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Date: 11 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Ulmer David<br>
Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroast~<br>

Article Title: Toward an Ontology of Relativism<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Article Title: The Self beyond Itself: Hermeneutics and Transpersonal Experience<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263716<br>
Date: 6 1, 1930<br>
Author(s): Underhill David R.<br>
Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

Article Title: Ricoeur's "Symbolism of Evil" and Cross-Cultural Comparison: The Representation of Evil in Maya Indian Culture<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263706<br>
Date: 12 1, 1951<br>
Author(s): Makemson Laurence L.<br>
Abstract: The principal purpose of this essay is to examine the theory of culture (and the role of symbols of the sacred in culture) which is presupposed in Ricoeur's Symbolism of Evil. The examination is motivated by the question whether or not the etiology of the symbolism of evil which Ricoeur offers in his important text will stand up to the demands imposed by cross-cultural applications. It is argued that Ricoeur's exposition invites an assumption of the cross-cultural validity of his schema. The process of examination comprises two major sections. First, a synopsis of Ricoeur's text is offered to establish a working understanding of the concepts which offer themselves as integral to any cross-cultural evaluation of the "symbolism of evil." Second, a "test-case" is defined: the religious symbolisms of Maya Indian culture. The definition of this test-case involves two secondary tasks: 1) a brief description of the general features of Maya religious symbolism; and, 2) an analysis of how Ricoeur's categories of the symbolism of evil fail to define accurately symbolisms of evil which occur in Maya mythology both before and after the conquest. This analysis leads finally to an assessment of the impact of western religious symbolisms on indigenous Maya symbolisms of evil. Ultimately, Ricoeur's analysis of the symbolism of evil is argued to be invalid for cross-cultural comparisons which extend beyond the cultural ambience of the western world.<br>

Abstract: Field research is a crucial component, if not the very foundation, of anthropological research. The concept is straightforward enough to seem a truism. One could stop here an enthuse on the heuristic benefits of participant observation (some scholars do so with an almost religious zeal). Otherwise one can adopt a more wary attitude and question the hidden, unspeakable reasons for such passion. A look at academia with an ethnographic slant (if one is free, so to say, to "ethnograph" the ethnographer) is sufficient to realise that field-work rhetoric is pervaded with extra-scientific motives. In the background lie corporate interests more similar to exclusion and "ethnological cleaning" than epistemology.<br>

Abstract: The legend is, as custum, the place were the principle of reality is suspended: "the place were day-dreaming is allowed". Actually, in the current practice, the use of this fabulous space/instrument crosses ambits officially destinated to the reverie. Fragments of legend impregnate the entire experience allowing us the most shameless alchemy. If we consider the "legendary" in its pragmatic implications and pass through the question: "what do we do, in the every day life, when we evoke in a more or less explicit way the semantic constellation linked with the notion of legend?", then the "legendary" is not so much the "projective place" where we live for a moment our phantasies, but rather an operation that allows to reconcile concrete interests and ideal values, playing on the demarcation line and mixing up cards skilfully.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses a recently completed research project, to answer the question, on what were the findings based? It draws on the hermeneutics of Gadamer to explore the relationship between researcher and research subject in qualitative educational research. It argues that all qualitative research findings are simultaneously subjective and objective, being essentially constructed interpretations of data which are partly, but only partly, external to the researcher. Yet many contemporary educational researchers tend to focus almost exclusively on either the subject matter under investigation or upon the standpoint of the researcher him/herself. A simultaneous combination of both is necessary to understand the nature of research findings.<br>

Publisher: Philosophy of Science Association<br>
Issue: i302046<br>
Date: 6 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Wartofsky Patrick<br>
Abstract: The author proposes the thesis that all perception, including observation in natural science, is hermeneutical as well as causal; that is, the perceiver (or observer) learns to 'read' instrumental or other perceptual stimuli as one learns to read a text. This hermeneutical aspect at the heart of natural science is located where it might be least expected, within acts of scientific observation. In relation to the history of science, the question is addressed to what extent the hermeneutical component within scientific observation opens natural science to the charge of reflecting merely cultural values, and of providing merely a culturally acceptable reading of the "Book of Nature", rather than, as the author states, one stating universal antecedent conditions of possibility of cultural activity itself.<br>

Abstract: Since the language of political inquiry seems to be inescapably metaphorical, the question necessarily arises as to how metaphors of various types, including models, enter into the composition and expression of political knowledge. The solutions that have been most influential in contemporary political science can be called the verificationist and constitutivist views of political metaphor. While both views contain important elements of truth, there are fundamental difficulties in each that require the search for a more satisfactory view. An alternative view of metaphor and political knowledge is developed by reference to four main problems: Why is political speech metaphorical? How do metaphors make political things manifest? How are political metaphors tested? and Are metaphors indispensable to political expression and political knowledge?<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010333<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Johnson Greg<br>
Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Abstract: Rwanda became a Belgian trusteeship under mandate of the Société des Nations after the first World War. With churches playing a prominent role in the political evolution of Rwanda, the two countries were closely bound together. After the 1959 revolution in Rwanda and independence in 1962, development cooperation with strong NGO input still linked them. While the genocide still has tragic influence on the new Rwanda, Belgium has undergone a political process leading to a federal state. The colonial past refers to a national past. Changes in Rwanda and Belgium question any collective attempt of mourning for a past that is very different for all parties involved. /// Le Rwanda devint une possession de la Belgique sous le mandat de la Société des Nations après la Première Guerre Mondiale. La conséquence du rôle proéminent des églises dans l'évolution politique du Rwanda fut la création de liens étroits entre les deux pays. Après la révolution de 1959 au Rwanda et l'indépendance en 1962, la coopération de développement avec l'impact des ONG ont maintenu ces liens entre les deux pays. Alors que le génocide a aujourd'hui toujours des conséquences sur le Rwanda moderne, la Belgique a, elle, a vécu une transformation politique menant à la formation d'un état fédéral. Le passé colonial se mire dans le passé national. Les transformations du Rwanda et de la Belgique mettent en question toute tentative collective de faire l'expérience du deuil d'un passé commun, vécu de manière très différente par les deux cultures.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>

Author(s): Deli Peter<br>
Abstract: There has been extensive debate on changing attitudes within the French left-wing intelligentsia in the decades following the Second World War and more specifically on why so many intellectuals became fellow travellers and were attracted to Stalinism in the period between 1945 and 1953. "Esprit's" reactions to de-Stalinisation from the time of the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956 to the Soviet suppression of the Czech attempt to reform communism from within in 1968 are of interest, since "Esprit" was the most prominent Catholic left-wing but non-Marxist journal in France. In view of "Esprit's" very strong reaction to the Hungarian Revolution, its relative silence in 1968 on the drama that was being played out in Czechoslovakia requires explanation. Finally, because "Esprit" broke with communism in late 1956, intellectuals writing for that journal experienced little difficulty in adjusting to the new French intellectual climate of the mid-1970s. /// De nombreux débats ont eu lieu autour de la question du changement d'attitude des intellectuels de gauche en France dans les décennies suivant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, et plus spécialement sur les raisons du succès du stalinisme dans ces milieux où se recrutèrent tant de compagnons de route entre 1945 et 1953. Les réactions d'"Esprit" à la dé-stalinisation, de l'invasion de la Hongrie en 1956 jusqu'à la répression du Printemps de Prague en 1968 sont particulièrement révélatrices à cet égard, car "Esprit" était la revue dominante du courant 'catholique de gauche -- non marxiste' en France. Au regard de la réaction très forte d'"Esprit" en 1956, son silence relatif lors du drame tchécoslovaque appelle une explication. Finalement, parce qu'"Esprit" a brisé ses liens avec le communisme à la fin de l'année 1956, les intellectuels qui travaillaient pour la revue ont eu peu de difficultés à s'adapter au nouveau climat intellectuel de la France du milieu des années 1970. /// Es hat eine ausgedehnte Diskussion um den Meinung~<br>

Abstract: If Descartes's "Cogito" can be held as the opening of the era of modern subjectivity, it is to the extent that the "I" is taken for the first time in the position of foundation, i.e., as the ultimate condition for the possibility of all philosophical discourse. The question raised in this paper is whether the crisis of the "Cogito", opened later by Hume, Nietzsche and Heidegger on different philosophical grounds, is not already contemporaneous to the very positing of the "Cogito".<br>

Abstract: En réaction à la double abstraction manifestée par la traditionnelle histoire des idées et par le structuralisme, l'histoire des intellectuels, à la fin des années 1980, a développé un programme de micro histoire sociale de la vie intellectuelle saisie à travers ses cadres concrets de fonctionnement tels les revues, les maisons d'éditions et les cercles de la sociabilité intellectuelle. Cette histoire culturelle des idées, attentive aux données impliquées par la transmission et la circulation des idées, a cependant délaissé l'examen des réalités langagières. Examiner comment le langage des œuvres modifie l'expérience des acteurs historiques reste un salutaire défi pour l'historien de la culture. Via l'étude des mécanismes de réception des œuvres, à travers celle des controverses, ou par le biais de la construction adéquate du contexte où joue la dialectique des faits moraux et sociaux, l'historien culturel, au carrefour de diverses disciplines voisines (histoire littéraire, sociologie des sciences, histoire conceptuelle du politique) s'inscrit au cœur des sciences humaines. /// Against the double abstraction shown by the traditional history of ideas and by structuralism, the history of intellectuals, at the end of the 1980s, developed a micro social history program of intellectual life seen through the study of journals, publishing houses and intellectual circles. This cultural history of ideas, attentive to the circulation and transmission of ideas, has nevertheless ignored the question of linguistic realities. Examining how the language of intellectual works modifies the experience of historical actors is a good challenge for the cultural historian. Through the study of how works are received, of the controversies, or through the appropriate construction of the context with the dialectical play of moral and social facts, the cultural historian, at the intersection of various related disciplines (literary history, sociology of science, conceptual history of politic~<br>

Abstract: Un chiaro esempio di questo riduzionismo si trova nell'analisi delle Supplici eschilee:
la presenza strutturante del rituale di supplica viene interpretata come chiaro segno della
religiosità integrale della tragedia, che esplora il comportamento dell'individuo e della col-
lettività: "as a religious question, in a religious structure, through religious language in a
religious context" (p. 213). Ho già cercato di dimostrare come la supplica sia una istituzione
civile nel senso più ampio: una "tragedia di supplica" invita in questo senso a un'esplorazio-
ne di temi civici in senso pregnante; cfr. Giordano 1999 (vedi supra, p. 45 n. 2), pp. 161-191.<br>

Abstract: J. Sadolet, op. cit., p. 25 : « Etenim si magnum est ac mirabile suscitare homines
mortuos, & qui cursum vitae iam confecerint, in eamdem rursus vitam restituere, quod
est non naturae sed Dei potentiae opus proprium, admirabilius multo esse débet, eos
qui verae vitae & divinae luci sint mortui & in foetore ac sordibus peccatorum iam
extabuerint, & Deo & ipsis vivos ac ex nefariis repente efflcere sanctos. Haec est igitur
potentia, haec iustitia & bonitas summi Dei, quae in Evangelio proposita & demonstrata
est... ». Relevons à ce propos une double proximité de Rabelais, i. Au ch. XXX de
Pantagruel ( uvres de R., Paris, Gallimard, 1955, p. 294 ss.) Panurge ramène Epistémon
à la vie. Ici le miracle est « naturalisé ». ii. Le retour à la vie spirituelle bien orientée
dont il est question dans le texte de Sadolet cité ci-dessus ne se fait pas sans la foi.
Dans le récit de la nativité de Gargantua (Gargantua, ch. Vi, uvres..., p. 23-24), texte
édité en 1534, Rabelais traite aussi de la foi, avec référence à Heb. 11,1. Quelques mois
plus tard, à propos du « miracle » de la justification par la foi, Sadolet a recours à son
tour à Heb. 11,1, et décrit la foi en termes analogues: elle est confiance, «fiducia»,
dans la réalisation des promesses divines. Ceci attire l'attention sur les révisions qui
ont cours, à cette date, au sein de l'institution traditionnelle, et conduit à un accueil
nuancé de la deuxième des formules de M. A. Sreech, L'évangélisme de Rabelais, aspects

              de la satire religieuse au XVI

précisément de Gargantua, ch. VI. Cf. Sadolet, op. cit., p. 48-49.<br>

Abstract: «[...] a small number of what I consider to be particularly important emblems, inserted in
key positions, bring the reader up with a jolt. These pivotal emblems are often those
which are visually most striking and most memorable, the ones in which the image itself
serves to deliver a vicious attack on the Roman Catholic church (18,32,35,37)», op. cit.,
p. 146; pour l'analyse de la structure générale, voir les pages 123 à 143.
La question posée au moins implicitement par A. Adams est celle de l'existence d'une
structure mnémotechnique. Cette hypothèse est clairement rejetée par Christophe Chaza-
lon en ce qui concerne les Icones, où « les cadres sont utilisés de façon totalement aléa-
toire » alors que « les portraits sont indifféremment de profil ou de 3/4, gauche ou droit, en
fonction des portraits qui ont servi de modèle.» (op. cit., p. 21, n. 62). D'une manière
générale, une utilisation consciente et systématique des principes de l'art de la mémoire
paraît peu probable lorsqu'on sait que les humanistes aussi bien catholiques que protes-
tants, s'inscrivant dans la tradition de Quintilien, ont adopté une attitude pour le moins
sceptique à l'égard de la mémoire artificielle. Frances A. Yates rappelle entre autres la
position de Melanchthon qui « interdit aux étudiants de recourir au moindre expédient
mnémotechnique, et [qui] les invite à apprendre par c ur de la façon normale, en voyant
là le seul art de la mémoire» (L'Art de la mémoire, Gallimard, 1975, p. 142).<br>

Article Title: The Making of a Social Theory: Anthony Giddens' Theory of Structuration<br>
Publisher: North Central Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i20831390<br>
Date: 4 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Dickie-Clark Hamish F.<br>
Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Abstract: In this paper I explore the questions of why and how sociologists should be interested in narrative. The answer to the first question is straightforward: Narrative texts are packed with sociological information, and a great deal of our empirical evidence is in narrative form. In an attempt to answer the second question, I look at definitions of narrative, distinguishing narrative from non-narrative texts. I highlight the linguistic properties of narrative and illustrate modes of analysis, paying close attention to both the structural properties of the text and its subtle linguistic nuances. I guide the reader through a detailed analysis of a short narrative text. I show how linguistics and sociology interplay at the level of a text.<br>

Abstract: La critique zolienne se situe « au confluent de Sainte-Beuve et de Taine », comme sa création littéraire a pour point de mire Balzac et Hugo. L'objectif de cette étude est d'apprécier la double influence des deux grands maîtres de la critique du XIX e siècle dans la naissance et le développement des théories du chef de file du naturalisme. La dette envers Taine est énorme, notamment, mais Zola est un disciple encombrant et insatisfait. Son activité critique, longtemps méconnue et réduite à des aperçus superficiels, même si elle est animée d'une fougue polémique, obéit à des principes, qu'il convient de dégager et d'examiner de près: c'est une poétique expérimentale, héritière des théories en vigueur, revisitant la question de la mimèsis, et, paradoxalement, un système ouvert, soucieux de frayer la voie à la modernité et de maintenir à leur plus haut niveau les fonctions et les pouvoirs de la littérature.<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others".

Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Abstract: It has been argued that in higher education academic disciplines can be seen as communities of practices. This implies a focus on what constitutes identities in academic culture. In this article I argue that the transition from newcomer to a full participant in a community of practice of physicists entails a focus on how identities emerge in learning how to highlight certain aspects of personal life histories. The analysis of interviews with 55 physicists shows that physicists often perceive experiences in their childhood as the first step into their professional identities as physicists. These experiences involve recollections of the ability to think scientifically (e.g., 'go beyond the surface'), and the ability to play with toys which can be connected to the practical life of physics. The process of identity formation can be described as developing in a relational zone of proximal development, where old-timers recognize particular playful qualities in newcomers as a legitimate access to a physicist identity. The article discusses how play which physicists connects with a scientific mind can constitute a relational zone of proximal developments in a community of practice as a particular "space of authoring" in a physicist culture, which cut across other cultural differences. Il a été admis que les disciplines de l'éducation supérieure peuvent être considérées comme des communautés de pratique. Cela pose la question de savoir comment se constituent les identités dans la culture académique. Dans cet article, pour mettre en évidence la transition de nouveau venu à participant à part entière dans une communauté de pratique de physiciens, j'examine non seulement la manière dont des identités émergent au travers des pratiques, mais aussi les aspects biographiques que les participants identifient comme ayant facilité leur transition. Une cohorte de 55 physiciens a été interviewée et leurs analyses ont été comparées à des données supplémentaires, notamment tirées d'une ob~<br>

Author(s): Lévy Jacques<br>
Abstract: Innovante en apparence dans son énoncé, la géographie culturelle pose un double problème épistémologique. D'abord, s'agit-il d'une nouvelle branche de la géographie ou d'une école de pensée qui prétend réorganiser l'ensemble des savoirs de la discipline? Le projet d'une géographie culturelle reprend et endosse les ambiguïtés du mot « culture » dans les sciences sociales contemporaines. Ensuite, le mot « culture » correspond le plus souvent à une version faible de la notion de société, en particulier dans les travaux anglophones. Cette géographie, qui aborde les sociétés sans le dire clairement, a-t-elle forgé de nouveaux outils pour explorer la dimension spatiale de ces sociétés? Si le « tournant culturel » a certainement contribué à faire avancer notre regard sur le monde social dans certains domaines, la réponse à cette question n'est pas toujours consistante. Au bout du compte, deux caractéristiques, qui pouvaient paraître périphériques, se révèlent essentielles pour éclairer les logiques de ces hésitations. L'une, théorique, concerne la mise en place éventuelle d'un paradigme du social qui se passerait d'un concept de société. L'autre, effet pratique du premier, concerne l'usage de discours universitaires prétendant fonder le « multiculturalisme » sur le respect des « cultures » pour légitimer le communautarisme contre la « société des individus ». Cultural geography proposes an apparently innovative project but it actually raises a dual epistemological issue. First of all, is it a new field inside geography or a school of thought that contends to redesign the overall geography's disciplinary layout? The perspective of a "cultural geography" encompasses and endorses the ambiguity of the word "culture" in contemporary social sciences. Secondly, "culture" is predominantly used as a weak version of "society", namely in English-speaking literature. Cultural geographers address societies but do not explicitly admit it. Have cultural geographers built fresh tools to e~<br>

Author(s): GROSSMAN KATHRYN M.<br>
Abstract: Victor Hugo's L'Homme qui rit (1869) presents a powerful, nightmarish vision of human longing and corruption. Recurrent imagery of aspiration and asphyxiation ties the romantic subplot, which focuses on the protagonist's divided affections, to a much wider vortex of desires. At the same time, the use of similar topoi to figure polar opposites calls into question the antithetical relationships themselves. This essay looks at the ways in which desire operates in Hugo's text, inscribing the struggle between good and evil within more global social issues. Whereas the representation of women might appear to adhere to the virgin-whore dichotomy, and so to reflect an anti-feminist stance, this dichotomy is deconstructed by Hugo's use of metaphorical lattices and multilevel symmetries to figure his own unspeakable (republican) yearning.<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes how Newman's Apologia seeks to articulate nineteenth-century conceptions of time through a canonical conception of prophetism, and how the question of private space is made into a national issue through Newman's narrative. The paper finally argues that Newman's technique of "replacement" deconstructs itself as a metaphorical process, which makes for the unique literariness of the Apologia.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I consider the rival liberal and communitarian accounts of justice emerging in complex, pluralist societies. I argue that we err in posing the question of human rights as a Hobson's choice between a formal, universal metanarrative, as envisioned in philosophical liberalism, or as a merely local, ethnocentric narrative of the western bourgeoisie, as in the communitarian critique. For human rights are best viewed rhetorically, as establishing the possibility of rationally persuasive argument across our varied narrative traditions. The essay concludes by attending to the role of religious belief in the public reason of a postmodern society.<br>

Abstract: Religious tolerance is a sociopolitical necessity. Social and political pressures alone cannot be expected to nurture a genuine attitude of religious tolerance; in the West, secular and religious documents rely on the concept of conscience for this nurture. In this essay I ask what claims people make on each other as they attempt to live in accordance with what they believe to be true and good. To answer this question, I examine the Pauline concept of conscience and argue that Paul interpreted conscience through an ethic and theology of accommodation.<br>

Abstract: This article studies the institutional context of recent reforms in ecclesiastical faculties, with special attention to the transformation of modern Universities. Four major problems are raised in this period of University renewal. 1) Should Universities stress research or teaching functions? 2) Should they admit the mass of students or be reserved to an elite? 3) How can they organize efficiently the University community? 4) What is their responsibility towards the collectivity? With regard to the first question, the author notes the current emphasis on research as compared to teaching. A reasonable balance between these two functions may be attained by drawing from philosophies of education within the English, French, German and American traditions. A rewarding survey of recent University legislation in various countries is made. The post-industrial era calls for a stress on research in such a way as to link it more effectively with the teaching function of the University. As to the second question, youth today assumes its right to a University education. Universities can neither receive all candidates nor, on the other hand, systematically impose a « numerus clausus ». Selectivity is necessary. A system of diversified Colleges, Universities and Faculties would permit everyone with the prerequisite aptitudes to receive a University training. Planning would be necessary among the institutions of a given region. A system of gradual and qualified selection is suggested. The third problem concerns the University as a community. Recent reforms require effective collaboration among all the components of the University: administrators, professors, students. All should have some voice in university government. More important than structures is the mentality which will effect a genuine solidarity and consensus among all members of the University community. The fourth problem regards the University's relationship to the collectivity. The University must protect its academic~<br>

Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Face à des objections d'hier et d'aujourd'hui aussi diverses que contradictoires, on veut montrer ici la légitimité d'un tel discours. Celui-ci suppose une double rupture: rupture avec une conception minimal ou formaliste de la raison qui refuse de se prononcer sur le principe de la vie; rupture avec une métaphysique intemporelle qui manque le nécessaire enracinement anthropologique de la question de Dieu. Philosophy is often denied discourse regarding the affirmation of God. Confronting the diverse and contradictory objections of the past and today, an attempt is made to show the legitimacy of such discourse. It supposes a double rupture: with the minimal or formalist conception of reason that refuses to pronounce on the principle of life; and with an untemporal metaphysic that lacks the necessary anthropological roots in the question of God.<br>

Issue: i23575105<br>

Abstract: Rosenzweig e Levinas pensano la Rivelazione di Dio nella storia richiamandosi su diversi aspetti, anche se con sottolineature specifiche. Per la tradizione ebraica il problema di Dio e della possibilità della sua rivelazione è di sapere come Egli agisca nei confronti dell'uomo. Per Rosenzweig, il riferimento alla vita vissuta apre la possibilità di un pensiero nuovo, dove il tempo diventa l'altro del soggetto. Allo stesso modo, per Levinas il soggetto e il suo potere richiamano, nell'incontro con l'altro, ad un Altro. Entrambi gli autori mettono quindi in risalto la centralità della chiamata dell'uomo all'obbedienza. Per Rosenzweig però, la Rivelazione di Dio è legata al comandamento dell'amore del prossimo, che è legato all'amore di Dio. Per Levinas invece, il rapporto con Dio si riduce al suo aver donato la legge agli uomini. Rosenzweig and Levinas reflect on the revelation of God in history drawing on different aspects of the question and offering different emphases. In both of these authors we recognize how it is central to Jewish tradition to reflect on the problem of God and on the possibility of his revelation by reflecting on the question of just how it is that he acts towards man. For Rosenzweig, a reference to life as lived opens the possibility of a new way of thinking where time becomes the 'other' that confronts the subject. Similarly, for Levinas the ability that the subject has to recall an encounter with the 'other' enables an openness to an encounter with the 'Other'. In each of these authors we witness a stress on man's call to obedience. However, for Rosenzweig, the revelation of God is linked to the commandment of love of one's neighbor, which is tied to God's love for us; for Levinas the relationship with God is reduced to his having given the law to men.<br>

Abstract: L'article aborde la question de l'universalisation que l'on attend du processus actuel de mondialisation, qui unifie la planète sur la base de l'économie du marché. Sous la poussée de la rationalité scientifique, la mondialisation réalise une universalisation de moyens susceptibles d'ouvrir potentiellement à toute l'humanité l'accès à des biens élémentaires qui améliorent son bien-être en libérant du besoin. On remarque toutefois que, sous l'influence de l'idéologie néolibérale, la prédominance de la dimension économique invertit la mondialisation en un projet instrumental de la part de ceux qui considèrent toute réalité, y compris l'homme, comme un moyen. La mondialisation produit ainsi une universalisation rationnelle qui concerne les choses ou les moyens, et non les hommes. Loin donc de réaliser la véritable universalisation de l'humanité, elle en pose tout au plus les conditions matérielles d'avènement et laisse de côté le problème crucial de la reconnaissance de l'homme par l'homme. The article addresses the question of the universalisation that can be expected from the current process of globalisation, which unifies the planet on the basis of the market economy. Propelled by scientific rationality, globalisation is producing a universalisation of resources that has the potential of providing all of humanity access to those basic goods which increase wellbeing by eliminating need. Nonetheless, it is observed that, under the influence of neoliberal ideology, the predominance of the economic dimension transforms globalisation into a project used by those who consider all reality, including human beings, as a means. Globalisation thus produces a rational universalisation that impacts things and resources but not human beings. Far from bringing about a true universalisation of humanity, globalisation at the most sets the material conditions of access but leaves to the side the crucial problem of the mutual recognition of man for man.<br>

Abstract: Può la psicologia contribuire in qualche modo ad avvicinarsi alle domande fondamentali della vita? La psicologia potrebbe essere e di fatto è spesso vista ed utilizzata come tecnica. In realtà ogni psicologia porta in se stessa dei semi più o meno sviluppati di una antropologia, così come ogni antropologia non può non avere una componente pedagogico/psicologica. Senza pretese di completezza l'articolo suscita alcune domande circa la inevitabile integrazione tra gli aspetti psicologici e le dimensioni fondamentali dell'essere quali la verità da conoscere, il bene per cui impegnarsi e l'unità o armonia che si trova alla base delle motivazioni umane. Il tutto non riesce a sottrarsi alla dimensione/missione pedagogica ricordando che la questione più che sul 'che' o il 'se', è piuttosto sul 'Quale' o sul 'come'. Can psychology contribute in some way to the approach to the fundamental questions of life? Psychology can be and indeed often is seen and used as a technique. In reality, every psychology carries in itself the seeds, more or less developed, of an anthropology, just as every anthropology cannot but have a pedagogical/psychological component. Without claiming to be comprehensive, the article raises some questions concerning the unavoidable integration of psychological aspects with the fundamental dimensions of being, such as the truth to be known, the good to be worked for, and the unity or harmony found at the basis of human motivations. All this cannot disregard the pedagogical dimension/mission, recalling that the question is not 'what' or 'if' but rather 'which one' and 'how'.<br>

Abstract: L'approche par les capabilités proposée par A. Sen a été considérée comme une révolution dans l'analyse du développement et, en particulier, de la pauvreté. Si elle a exercé une influence sur les indicateurs du développement, elle pose néanmoins la question de la conception sous-jacente du sujet. Cet article montre que la conception de la personne utilisée par Sen est insuffisante et qu'il pratique un individualisme très standard. Cette approche est d'autant plus problématique qu'elle n'est pas simplement compréhensive, mais aussi normative. En ne tenant pas compte de la fragilité de la personne, son analyse aboutit finalement à une faiblesse morale. The capability approach proposed by A. Sen constitutes a real change in the poverty analysis. It influenced considerably development indicators. However, the question who really is the subject behind this approach is at stake. In this paper we defend the idea that the conception of the person used by Sen is relatively standard. It is then problematic because his approach is not only comprehensive but also normative. His analyse finally conducts to a moral weakness. El enfoque de las capabilidades propuesto por A. Sen fue considerado como una revolución en el análisis del desarrollo y, en particular, en el de la pobreza. Si bien ejerció una influencia sobre los indicadores de desarrollo, plantea la cuestión de la concepción subyacente del sujeto. Este artículo muestra que la concepción de la persona utilizada por Sen es insuficiente y que practica un individualismo muy estándar. Este enfoque es aún más problemático dado que no es simplemente comprensivo sino también normativo. Al no considerar la fragilidad de la persona, su análisis desemboca finalmente en una debilidad moral.<br>

Abstract: As a major source of social values in East Asia, Confucianism assumes especial significance amidst the proliferation of instrumental rationality in modern societies. This study attempts to answer the question: how Confucian are contemporary Chinese? By way of constructing an ideal type of Confucian actors, which is then applied to a survey of three Chinese communities, this study tries to formulate a new perspective in depicting the character of modern Confucian actors, measured in terms of their dynamic proximity to the Confucian ideal type. Our approach marks a shift of emphasis, both empirically and methodologically, compared with previous work on this topic. On the empirical side, our study breaks with the long-standing, classical distinction between the 'gentleman' and the 'commoner' prevalent in Confucian discourse. Degrees of proximity to Confucian values are viewed in representational—i.e. non-evaluative—terms. In constructing the ideal type of Confucian actors, we distinguish between formal and substantive values in Confucianism. This analytical distinction allows our study to demonstrate the continued relevance of Confucianism. While substantive values change over time, the formal, analytical core that captures the essence of Confucianism continues to survive in the face of the vicissitudes of modernity and the spread of instrumental rationality.<br>

Abstract: Cet article traite d'une part de la question de l'intersubjectivité — au sens merleau-pontien — dans le processus de la recherche, d'autre part des relations entre critique littéraire et histoire des sciences et des idées. L'examen de ma dette intellectuelle envers Gérard Simon conduira à l'analyse de la question de l'optique chez Marcel Proust, et tout particulièrement au décryptage des rapports, à première vue dépassés à son époque, qu'il établit entre regard et rayon visuel. The first part of this article deals with intersubjectivity and how I became interested in research from a Merleau-Pontian point of view. Part two explores the relationship between literary studies and the history of science and ideas. Indeed, I shall analyze the intellectual influence Gérard Simon had on my work, which then led me to a study of optics in Marcel Proust. I focus on the boundaries he draws between sight and visual ray, a distinction which, on a surface level, might appear to be outdated in his time.<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: Although Hannah Arendt distinguishes three human activities from each other in Human Condition — labor, work and action — they are supposed not to be three different types of human activities but to be three different aspects of human activity. Assuming this to be the case, this paper demonstrates that social theory has not enough taken action in the sense of Arendt into account, even modern scholars such as Bourdieu, but it has continued to remain almost always on the level of work because of its concept of time. The second question is what consequence social theory may draw, if this aspect of human activity is recognized as essential and its concept of time changed. One answer proposed by the author is the sociology of forgiveness even though it has not been treated as a subject for modern sociology.<br>

Abstract: Contre les excès de l'individualisme libéral et l'incapacité des politiques sociales de résoudre les problèmes, les communautariens proposent de reconstruire le modèle social sur le lien intercommunautaire. Critiquant le modèle libéral/universaliste de dénier toute diversité au profit de l'individu prétendument neutre mais qui ne représente en fait que les préoccupations d'un homme blanc et hétérosexuel, ils proposent un modèle de la reconnaissance centré sur la "reconnaissance de la valeur égale" de chaque culture. Mais face à la question multiculturelle, leur attitude n'est pas dépourvue ambiguïtés, ce qui entraîne des risques de discrimination, d'affrontement et de violence. Against the excesses of liberal individualism and the incapacity of social policies to resolve the resulting problems, communitarians suggest rebuilding social relations on the basis of an intercommunitarian link. Criticizing the liberal/universalist model because it denies diversity for the sake of individualism (which claims to be neutral, but in fact represents the interests of White and Black heterosexual man), communitarians propose a model of recognition based on the "acknowledgment of equal value" of every culture. However when facing multicultural issues, their attitude tends to become ambiguous and involves risks of discrimination, and thus of confrontation and, ultimately, violence.<br>

Abstract: L'ambition de cet article est d'apporter une contribution en matière d'analyse interprétative du phénomène guerrier. Dans cette optique, il s'interroge sur les mécanismes de la pensée stratégique qui ont contribué à faire de la guerre moderne une pratique sociale jugée techniquement faisable et, partant de là, légitime pour les militaires. Pour ce faire, l'analyse proposée s'inscrit dans les champs, très proches sur le plan théorique, de la sociologie pragmatique (en s'inspirant d'auteurs tels que Luc Boltanski, Nicolas Dodier et Francis Chateauraynaud) et de la sociologie des sciences (en s'appuyant surtout sur les travaux de Bruno Latour). D'une part, la sociologie des sciences a développé un très fertile questionnement portant sur la construction des faits scientifiques dont la présente étude s'inspirera largement. D'autre part, la sociologie pragmatique a élaboré un cadre de compréhension des actions collectives qui s'articule à l'enquête sur la construction sociale des faits. Grâce à ces deux approches, nous nous proposons d'enquêter sur la formation d'un régime d'expertise stratégique qui soutient la légitimité technique de l'emploi de la force militaire. Ensemble, la sociologie des sciences et la sociologie pragmatique apportent un éclairage particulièrement pertinent à la question de la guerre. This article is intended to contribute to the interpretative analysis of war. For that purpose, I investigate how some apparatuses located in strategic thinking help making modern war a social practice considered as technically feasible and, at the same time, legitimate for soldiers. In order to do that, I made use of two different but closely related theoretical fields, i.e., pragmatic sociology (finding inspiration in the work of scholars such as Luc Boltanski, Nicolas Dodier and Francis Chateauraynaud), and sociology of scientific knowledge (mostly by referring to the work of Bruno Latour). On the one hand, the sociology of scientific knowledge has developed a prod~<br>

The author, in a first part, proposes a definition of the concept of legacy in political parties in general. In a second time, he analyzes the policies of legacy in the Italian and French Communist parties. These CP have a different relation with their past because they choose different strategies: strategy of breakdown with Communist experience in Italy and, on the opposite, strategy of continuity for the French Communist party.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le déb~<br>

Abstract: En Palestine, chaque année au mois d'avril, a lieu le pèlerinage musulman de Moïse (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ). Située dans le désert, entre Jérusalem et Jéricho, la tombe du prophète rassemble autour d'elle des pèlerins venus de l'ensemble de la Cisjordanie. Ce lieu de mémoire collective fixe et rappelle un événement lointain rapporté par la tradition musulmane : la mort de Moïse. Dans le même temps, il suscite des questionnements en chaîne : le législateur des Hébreux est-il mort dans ce lieu? Ou, comme le stipule la Bible, dans un endroit inconnu des hommes? Estil d'ailleurs vraiment mort? Son corps est-il là? Etc. Ces questions, qui portent sur les circonstances et la réalité de l'événement, reviennent à s'interroger ici et maintenant sur la présence d'un intercesseur efficace entre les hommes et Dieu. Elles sont donc étroitement liées à une problématique plus large, celle de savoir comment construire l'accessibilité et le contact avec un « ailleurs invisible », ce Dieu transcendant et lointain que l'islam propose à l'instar du judaïsme et du christianisme. Dans cet article je propose d'explorer l'indécision qui est le corollaire de cette longue série de questionnements ne trouvant aucune réponse définitive. In Palestine every year in the month of April, the Muslim pilgrimage of Moses (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ) takes place. Located in the desert between Jerusalem and Jericho, the grave of the Prophet gathers pilgrims from the entire West Bank. This place of collective memory fixes and recalls a distant event reported by Muslim tradition: the death of Moses. At the same time, it raises questions: did the Hebrew legislator die there? Or, as stated in the Bible, in a place unknown to men? Is he really dead? Is his body there? Etc. These questions, which relate to the circumstances and the reality of the event amounts to question here and now the presence of an effective intercessor between man and God. They are closely related to a larger issue, that of how to build accessibi~<br>

Abstract: Será possível colocar a questão da culpa à parte de determinantes morais e históricos? Heidegger parece pensar que sim e, em verdade, empreende esta tarefa com base na reflexão sobre o papel do chamamento, um tema que, como a culpa, também está rodeado por inevitáveis conotações religiosas. O seu propósito inicial, mesmo que não declarado explicitamente, é mostrar a viabilidade de uma análise do chamamento, sem fazer uma apologia de qualquer tradição. Por seu lado, Foucault mostrou-nos os problemas associados com uma separação histórico-social do tema da culpa. Neste artigo pretendo expor estas duas abordagens sobre a questão da culpa. Is it possible to raise the question of guilt apart from those moral and historical determinants? Heidegger seems to think so and actually undertakes this task based on the reflection on the role of the call, a matter that, like guilt, is also surrounded by unavoidable religious cannotations. Its initial purpose, but does not state explicitly, is to show that it is feasible consistent and deep analysis of the call without making at any time through you an apology for any religious tradition. For his part, Foucault has shown us the problems associated with socio-historical untethering of the issue of guilt. In this paper I intend to expose these two lines of approach to the question of guilt.<br>

Abstract: This article explores an essential side of the French collective memory : the commemoration of July 14 1789 held during the ceremonies of the Bicentenial of the French Revolution. Through the analysis of different French newspapers from opposite political sides, they study the constitution of collective memory as discourse. They also question the status of the concept of discourse as history and linguistics envision it.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Mills Kevin<br>
Abstract: This paper sets out to question contemporary notions of language which employ metaphors of imprisonment or confinement to describe the alleged failure of the word to connect with the world. Valentine Cunningham's recent book. In the Reading Gaol, is confronted with Helen Keller's experience of being excluded from language (as described in her autobiography), in order to argue that the issue of hermeneutic freedom needs to be rethought. This involves raising certain doubts about freedom—doubts identified by means of a consideration of the cases of New Testament prisoners: Peter, John, Paul and Silas. I conclude that freedom, confronted by doubt (evident in ascetical gestures) is produced by a hermeneutics of hope. Hope, constituted by its own rivenness, both allows and limits the effects of hermeneutical suspicion. The imprisoning effect ascribed to language can then be seen as a failure with regard to hope.<br>

Article Title: SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922199<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Morgan Ben<br>
Abstract: The article uses a reading of Eliot's Middlemarch and a discussion of Levinas and Heidegger to challenge two aspects of the approach to literary texts proposed by Toril Moi. I suggest that we needn't assume that the inner lives of others are inaccessible in the way Moi (following Stanley Cavell) does, nor that literature has a privileged role in helping us come to terms with this alterity. Literature is one practice amongst others with which relations with other people are negotiated more or less honestly. I argue that recent developments in phenomenology and cognitive science, in particular the focus on enactive and participatory models of being in the world, can help to make more concrete Heidegger's concept of being-with (Mitsein) and Levinas' concept of proximité. Heidegger and Levinas' can then take their place in a counter tradition of 20th-century thinkers who engage with human togetherness rather than declare it to be impossible. The question Heidegger and Levinas' raise about the ethical challenge of human togetherness is not, however, answered by more recent research. It is by turning back to Middlemarch and viewing it in the context of its original marketing that we can see one way that this challenge may be confronted in everyday life.<br>

Publisher: Verlag für Medizinische Psychologie<br>
Issue: i23987363<br>
Date: 1 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Tress Wolfgang<br>
Abstract: Unsere Literaturübersicht diskutiert die Frage, ob und inwieweit eine reife Liebesfähigkeit Erwachsener von entsprechenden Früherfahrungen abhängt bzw. inwieweit Liebe und Partnerschaft eine Korrektur ungünstiger emotionaler Erfahrungen der frühen Kindheit ermöglichen. Bestimmte Partnerschaftsstörungen stehen zu konkreten familiären Gegebenheiten der ersten Lebensjahre in keinem zwingenden Bezug. Sind Partnerschaftsstörungen nach traditioneller psychoanalytischer Auffassung als Folge eines ungelösten infantilen Konfliktes anzusehen, so greifen neuere Ansätze angesichts des weitgehenden Fehlens einer psychoanalytischen Interaktionstheorie bei der Beschreibung und Erklärung interpersoneller Phänomene zunehmend auf systemische Ansätze zurück. Äußerungen psychoanalytischer Autoren zur Entwicklung der Liebesfähigkeit reflektieren im historischen Überblick wesentliche Veränderungen der Theoriebildung. Neuere empirische Arbeiten weisen auf Korrektur- und Kompensationsmöglichkeiten ungünstiger Früherfahrungen von mittlerem Schweregrad hin. Dafür aber dürfte die warme und bedürfnisgerechte Zuwendung durch eine oder mehrere feste Bezugspersonen (möglichst durch die liebevoll und partnerschaftlich aufeinander bezogenen Eltern) in den ersten Lebensjahren eine grundlegende Voraussetzung erwachsener Liebes- und Partnerschaftsfähigkeit sein. In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal~<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i24021505<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Ungureanu Camil<br>
Abstract: Bourdieu and Derrida share a focus on the ambiguity of the practice of gift relationships already pointed out by Mauss. From Bourdieu's perspective, the question of gratuity is epistemically futile, as it veils the objective truth of gift-giving, yet ethically and politically relevant, as it refers to a hypocrisy which can be instrumental to enhancing civic virtue and solidarity. Bourdieu's "scientific humanism," however, implausibly reduces this ambiguity to interest maximization, and aims to build a solidaristic democracy by means of the generalization of the hypocrisy of gratuity. In turn, by interpreting gratuity as "unconditionality," Derrida aims not at dissolving, but at dramatizing the ambiguity of gift relationships by turning it into "madness" and an "impossible possibility". Whereas I agree with Derrida's insistence on the salience of the requirement of gratuity, his approach can lead to counterintuitive and hubristic consequences. Instead, I suggest some elements of an alternative way of understanding gratuitous gifts as communicative acts irreducible to an economic calculation or circle. From this standpoint, a gratuitous gift can be constituted by certain forms of recognition, emotions, or convictions without for that becoming an "impossibility".<br>

Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Abstract: In this article, Levinas' ethical metaphysics is analyzed and his contribution to present-day philosophy is described. In his philosophy, ethics is not something that originates in the autonomous will, as Kant would have premised. It is, rather, the result of the traumatic rupturing of the I by the Other, a heteronomous event. The I's passivity in being opened by the Other is highlighted by Levinas in the words "substitution," "obsession," and "being elected." The I, in the critical Others' eyes, is guilty. The infinity in the Other's demand, regarding the I, is divine. It would be a fatal misunderstanding of Levinas to think that, with the insertion of the word "God," he becomes a theologian. In this article the relation between ethics and politics is discussed and their relation to God is pointed to. In this way, Levinas' discourse on God is demonstrated as being fitting for our time, after the crisis of humanism during the Holocaust. In the course of the article, the question of whether there "is" a God in the eyes of Levinas, and if man "needs" Him is answered. In other words, the logical status of the word "God" in Levinas' philosophy is defined.<br>

Abstract: Currently, epistemological debates on the formation of concepts in the field of history are close to nonexistent. For that reason alone, this book written by philosopher of history Doris Gerber - with which she earned her habilitation degree at the University of Tübingen - is a welcome addition to the literature in the field. In this work, Gerber addresses the metaphysical question of what "history" really is. In this study, she considers approaches typically adopted within the field of history, and questions whether the intention to act is essential in writing history, or whether it is even required in the first place. The findings of the four reviewers that follow are diverse in their opinion of this provocative study.<br>

Author(s): Guggenberger Wilhelm<br>
Abstract: This article tries to give an outline of Christian ethics in a pluralistic world most clearly characterized by its Babel of moral languages. There is no longer any single valid moral language. The liberal solution to establish a neutral moral language – a moral Esperanto – to solve this crisis of modernity is not possible without turning into some sort of moral imperialism. To avoid, however, the other extreme – nihilism – this article follows to some degree "communitarian" thinkers like A. MacIntyre, J. Stout and M. Walzer. Every ethics must be rooted in a narrative tradition and needs a concrete community as its precondition. The second part of this article addresses the narrative structure of Christian ethics. At first it follows MacIntyre's insight that every ethics is based on myth. It differs, however, from MacIntyre's position by putting special emphasis on the substantial content of the Christian "myth". With the help of Girard's mimetic theory this article distinguishes between archaic myths that are the product of the scapegoat mechanism and identify with the view of the lynch mob and the Biblical history of salvation that consists of a story written from the perspective of the victims of collective persecution. In the center of Christian ethics we find the example of Jesus Christ – the victim of collective violence par excellence – and the example of those of his disciples who became aware of their own contribution to Jesus's death and converted to the side of the victim. The third part of this article addresses the question of the concrete community that makes Christian ethics possible. Again MacIntyre's communitarian emphasis on the connection between concrete communities and ethics is taken as a starting point. Whereas communitarians, however, tend to support patriotism the community necessitated by Christian ethics is the universal Church. Patriotism like the ancient Greek polis is essentially characterized by its enmity to outside communities, a frie~<br>

Abstract: The christology of the French Jesuit Joseph Moingt, L'homme qui venait de Dieu (published in 1993), is part of the younger history of narrative theology. Referring to the christology of Rahner and Balthasar, Jüngel and Pannenberg, Moingt is "reconstructing" the history of faith in the horizon of the narrative time of the Gospel. The criterion for this "reconstruction" is the history – of God and men – which follows the path of the Gospel's texts and which has been orientated from the beginning to future. Jesus Christ is "announced as the man who has to come and whom the whole world attended", the man "coming from the future and who is the future of men, because of illuminating for all men the way to the future". Joseph Moingt's "théologie du récit" récit" to the discussion about the foundation of systematic christology. The following article presents the principal idea of Moingt's christology, it is governed by the question of the Christ's preexistence. This is the central point in the discussions about the importance of narrativity in actual dogmatics.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with the question of what constitutes a hymn, within the framework of the existing state church. This framework is defined as "religious pluralization", characterized by an individualized understanding of Christ, and the parallel development of a new interdenominational religious awareness, two trends which have been increasingly prominent since the days of post-Reformation Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. "Pluralization" is intimately associated with a fundamental movement away from traditional forms of religious piety. The article attempts to describe the hymn as a figure of "tentative continuity"; that ist, the hymn is the means by which human beings symbolically express their religious perception of their own finiteness in history. The hymn can therefore claim a more universal validity than if it merely pinpoints a specific moment of human religious history. At this point, the article carefully examines several examples of older as well as of more modern hymnody.<br>

Abstract: Die politische Theorie der Gegenwart beschäftigt sich vorrangig mit den Tugenden demokratischer Institutionen. Sie sollte deshalb das Problem der Politikertugenden nicht aus dem Blick verlieren. Gegen Versuche zu seiner Lösung werden gerne drei Einwände vorgebracht: 1. Ein besonderes Berufsethos für Amtsträger stelle die für eine Demokratie konstitutive Idee der politischen Gleichheit in Frage. 2. Die Komplexität der modernen Politik mache es unmöglich, einzelnen Individuen Verantwortung für politische Entscheidungen und deren Folgen zuzuweisen. 3. Der Bereich der Politik eigne sich ohnehin nicht für die Anwendung moralischer Kategorien. Anhand eines komplexen Konzepts der Integrität des Politikers will ich in dieser Abhandlung versuchen, diese Einwände zu entkräften. Contemporary political theory primarily focuses on the virtues of democratic institutions. It should not, for this reason, loose the problem of the virtues of politicians out of sight. Three objections are usually raised against attempts to solve it: 1. A specific professional ethics for officeholders puts into question the idea of political equality which is constitutive for a democracy. 2. Given the complexity of modern politics, it is impossible to ascribe responsibility for political decisions and their consequences to specific individuals. 3. The realm of politics does not allow for the application of moral categories anyway. By developing a complex concept of the integrity of the politician in this paper, I try to invalidate these objections.<br>

Article Title: D'eutopie en dystopie: La poétique de l'espace antillais dans "Morne Câpresse" de Gisèle Pineau<br>
Publisher: University of Nebraska Press<br>
Issue: i24243336<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Ziethen Antje<br>
Abstract: Dans Morne Câpresse, le Morne—lieu de résistance et déncrage/ancrage identitaire dans le discours antillais—se mue chez Pineau en un lieu déstabilisant et incertain. Sa dégénération se double non seulement d'une critique du capitalisme, du patriarcat et du colonialisme mais également d'une mise en question des contre-discours idéologiques marxiste, féministe et anticolonial. L'univers dysphorique conçu par l'auteure émerge, à notre avis, d'une écriture intertextuelle et autoréférentielle hyperbolique. Pineau recycle et tourne en dérision les motifs de la littérature (mythologie grecque, utopie, littérature antillaise) tout en posant un regard désenchanté et sceptique sur la société actuelle. La poétique de l'espace antillais, dans ce roman, est spéculaire d'un monde de radicalisation, d'excès, de surexploitation et d'angoisse. Morne Câpresse appelle de la sorte à une réflexion sur ce que l'on pourrait qualifier de "méta-modernité" telle qu'évoquée chez Gilles Lipovetsky (l'hypermodernité), Marc Augé (la surmodernité) et Ulrich Beck (la deuxième modernité).<br>

problème historique identifié depuis longtemps,
par les historiens de l'art notamment, au pro-
blème des générations. Sur ce point, voir par
exemple W. Pinder, Das Problem der Generation
in der Kunstgeschichte Europas (1926), ou K.

Author(s): Fœssel Michaël<br>
Abstract: Voir « L'équivoque du symbolique », art. cité, p. 82. On ne saurait certes rabattre l'her-
méneutique défendue par Descombes (qui est d'orientation wittgensteinienne) sur celle dont se
réclame Ricœur. Mais cette question est relativement secondaire ici dans la mesure où c'est
avec la catégorie même du « sens » (disons, avec tous ses usages herméneutiques) que la pensée
de Lévi-Strauss nous invite à rompre. Nous retrouverons toutefois ce problème en fin de par-
cours : si Descombes entend construire une herméneutique que ne précéderait aucune phéno-
ménologie, il nous semble que la « pensée sauvage » est lourde d'une phénoménologie qui n'est
susceptible d'aucune reprise herméneutique.<br>

Abstract: Ce procédé littéraire provient aussi, en partie au moins, d'une stratégie indirecte adoptée
par Coetzee : « Depuis quelque temps déjà, il a pris l'habitude, lorsqu'il est invité à donner une
conférence, de recourir à un procédé hautement déviateur (a richly deflective device) : il lit un
récit sur un écrivain invité à donner une conférence » (James Wood, "A Frog's Life", London
Review of Books, 13 octobre 2003, p. 15). C'est ainsi qu'invité à Tilburg (en Hollande) à un col-
loque sur la question du Mal, il y a précisément lu « Le problème du Mal » qui est devenu un
chapitre de son livre.<br>

Abstract: La philosophie pose l'idéal d'un discours clair et rigoureux. Pourtant quel auteur n'a pas eu recours, entre autres, à l'usage des métaphores ? La philosophie peut-elle s'accommoder d'une rhétorique ? Peut-elle se passer de la métaphore ? Cette question, posée notamment par Hans Blumenberg, éclaire un débat central de la philosophie contemporaine.<br>

d'universalisation potentielle de son discours, conduit à des non-dits qui engendrent les contra-

Abstract: Il suffit de lire ou de relire, sur ce point, sa « Préface » au Jésus de Bultmann (Paris, Le

Texte à Paction II («Herméneutique philosophique et herméneutique biblique »)... Certes, on
ne lui reproche pas (en principe!) d'être chrétien. Le soupçon énonce plutôt ceci : la philoso-
phie que Ricœur veut profane est en réalité chrétienne. Le plus simple est de renvoyer ici à sa
réponse à C. Bouchindhomme dans Temps et récit de Paul Ricœur en débat, op. cit., p. 212, avec
la question pertinente qu'il pose : « Les penseurs de la modernité ne peuvent-ils entendre que
leur propre discours? »<br>

Abstract: «Vous touchez là ce qui fait mon grand remords » dit Ricœur en réponse à une question
sur Bergson de François Azouvi et Marc de Launay (la Critique et la conviction, Paris, Calmann-
Lévy, 1995, p. 136). Il y est bien sûr revenu longuement, en le rapprochant d'ailleurs de Freud,
dans une section cruciale de la Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli, cinq ans plus tard (p. 554-574). Il
lui aura, cependant, toujours fait le même reproche : à savoir, d'imputer à « l'action » la spatia-
lisation qui nous éloignerait de la vie et de la durée. Mais n'aurait-on pas pu voir aussi que
Bergson ne distingue deux sens de l'action et de la vie que pour les réunir, dans l'action libre et
la création individuelle ou historique? N'est-ce pas sa manière à lui — et laquelle - de tenir
compte des deux aspects « effectif » et « puissant » qui sont derrière l'expérience de l'homme
agissant et souffrant?<br>

Abstract: Voir Alain Badiou, Saint Paul. La fondation de l'universalisme, Paris, PUF, 1998. Dans
un tout autre registre, Levinas a formulé un soupçon sur la possibilité de traduire la croyance
monothéiste dans des termes humanistes : « La question de la divinité du Dieu-un peut-elle se
poser comme se pose la question de Vhumanité de Phomme? » (Autrement qu'être ou au-delà de
l'essence, Paris, rééd. Le Livre de poche, 1978, p. 155, je dois cette référence à Didier Franck).
Chez Levinas, ce soupçon ne mène pas à la critique de tout humanisme, mais à la recherche de
P« humanisme de l'autre homme ».<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion sur l'homoparentalité comme révélateur des changements de la parenté en

sion de mon article « Pacs, sexualité et différence des sexes », Esprit, octobre 1999, qui mettait
en cause la logique « identitariste » (opposant deux grandes classes substantielles d'individus,
les homosexuels versus les hétérosexuels) au profit d'une approche « relationnelle » de l'égalité
(impliquant de transformer le droit commun de la famille dans un sens pluraliste en instituant
le couple de même sexe et non pas seulement le couple de sexe opposé).<br>

Abstract: Un tout récent rapport de recherche, proposant en introduction une analyse de législa-
tion comparée portant sur 21 pays, souligne fortement la spécificité du cas allemand sur la
question de la paternité en cas de don de sperme : « La législation allemande fait figure d'excep-
tion notoire à ce propos. Une remise en cause de la paternité du mari y est possible, sans que
l'acte de PMA en lui-même ne soit remis en cause. En effet, la loi laisse ouverte une double pos-
sibilité, celle de contester la paternité de l'homme du couple suivie de celle d'entamer une
constatation de paternité à l'encontre du donneur. Il s'agit de la seule législation considérée
[...] où le donneur peut être déclaré père des enfants nés de son don, et ceci contre son gré. »

Abstract: 11 me semble très significatif que la toute récente étude universitaire française (2009)
qui traite de la question de l'AMP avec don de sperme, n'inclut, jusque dans son plan, que les
donneurs de sperme (partie III) et les couples demandeurs (partie IV). Cette étude - remar-
quable par ailleurs - Nikos Kalampakilis (sous la dir. de), Enjeux éthiques et identitaires enga-
gés dans l'acte de procréation avec don de sperme, Université Lumière Lyon 2 - ne présente rien
sur le vécu des enfants conçus ainsi. Le devenir d'un sujet conçu par Iad demeure, est-il
reconnu, un «continent inexploré». Encore fallait-il l'explorer! Je suis en ce sens frappée du
fait que les trente adultes avec lesquels j'ai mené des entretiens cliniques et qui - dans leur
immense majorité - ont été conçus dans le cadre des Cecos se sont tous plaints que l'institution
ne se soit jamais intéressée à leur sort pas plus qu'à celui de leurs parents... On connaît la rai-
son de cette absence de suivi : l'idée consistait précisément à les « oublier » afin de ne pas les
stigmatiser. Mais le résultat n'est pas forcément concluant...<br>

Abstract: Plus qu'une période de l'histoire européenne, les Lumières désignent un nouvel ethos. Ainsi que l'ont montré Foucault et Blumenberg, chacun à leur manière, les Lumières posent la question de la modernité comme manière singulière de se tenir dans son temps et d'en explorer l'essence. Désormais, le présent est valorisé comme rupture et nouveauté, au détriment du poids de la tradition et de l'autorité du passé. Quelles sont les attitudes subjectives liées à cette promotion de l'actuel ?<br>

Abstract: L'irruption de la question du soin dans le débat politique a suscité la perplexité. Il n'apparaît pourtant pas par hasard : comment allons-nous prendre en charge la dépendance du grand âge? Les mécanismes de l'État-providence sont-ils adaptés à ce type de situation ? Comment respecte-t-on l'autonomie d'une personne qui ne peut plus agir par elle-même? Ces sujets, le plus souvent refoulés, restent difficiles à aborder, quand ils ne suscitent pas un rejet violent.<br>

Abstract: Maintenir l'ordre : voilà une question qui séparait d'emblée ceux qui faisaient l'apologie du désordre et les partisans d'un ordre autoritaire. Une réflexion sur le maintien de l'ordre policier doit aujourd'hui permettre de saisir qu'il y a des manières plus ou moins démocratiques de faire respecter l'ordre.<br>

Abstract: E. Macron présente le dernier livre de Paul Ricœur en se focalisant sur sa question centrale : qu'est-ce que la représentation d'une chose passée? De l'ambition de fidélité de la mémoire à la visée véritative de l'histoire en passant par l'attestation du témoignage, l'énigme de la représentation présente d'une chose absente reprend à nouveaux frais le problème de la confiance dans le réel déjà abordé dans Soi-même comme un Autre.<br>

Abstract: On part ici de l'hypothèse que Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines de Jacques Derrida est en quelque sorte l'illustration de La Voix et le phénomène et donc la critique, par Derrida, de la phénoménologie de l'intuition, de la perception et de la vue. On relève toutefois aussi des rencontres avec Husserl et Kant. On n'oublie pas non plus qu'il y va de l'art, des arts visuels et, dans la grande richesse thématique de cet ouvrage, on relève des moments forts, aussi bien que des moments faibles, au sujet des arts du « visible ». La question demeurant : Derrida « voit »-il le dessin, la peinture et, même, entend-il la musique? The starting point of this paper is the hypothesis that Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines is somehow the illustration of Speech and Phenomenon, and constitutes consequently Derrida's critique of the phenomenology of intuition, perception and vision. It is however also possible to put the emphasis on some crossingpoints with Husserl and Kant. What should not be forgotten is the fact that what is at stake here is art, i.e. visual arts, and that in the great thematic richness of this work, it is possible to bring to light strong and weak points concerning the arts of the « visible ». But the question remains : can Derrida « see » the design, the painting, and even can he hear the music?<br>

Abstract: The notion of text acquires a fundamental epistemological role in the disciplines of language in the second half of the XXth century. The analysis of some linguistic objects we have called semiological tools could highlight some epistemological issues in the use of the term text. From the Sixties we can observe that text has progressively acquired the general status of an object of analysis. Nevertheless, if linguistic text proves to be a common object of analysis for semiotics and hermeneutics, then it is necessary to reconsider their epistemological relations, to understand something new about what text is. Considering the interpretative problem in the hjelmslevian epistemology, a new perspective emerges between these complementary approaches to text. Comparing semiotics and hermeneutics we can also question the epistemological role that the notion of text embodies among contemporary disciplines of language.<br>

Abstract: Aristote observe une autre distinction, bien qu'il ne s'y tienne pas rigou-
reusement : la μίξις désigne chez lui le mélange véritable, l'interpénétration, par
opposition à ce qui n'a que l'apparence du mélange, la juxtaposition; la κράσις
désigne cette même interpénétration telle qu'elle s'applique spécifiquement aux
liquides. Cette terminologie a pu influencer aussi des stoïciens attentifs à la pen-
sée aristotélicienne. Sur la délicate question de la doctrine stoïcienne authentique
et du syncrétisme aristotélio-stoïcien, nous renvoyons aux réflexions circonstan-
ciées de B.Collette-Ducic et S. Delcomminette, art. cit., pp. 9-11.<br>

Abstract: Comme le montre l'excellent article de E. Eliasson {art. cit.), il est par
ailleurs très intéressant de noter que, chez les médioplatoniciens, cette reprise
se fera à partir d'une double réception : celle du mythe d'Er, à partir duquel il
s'agit d'articuler les rôles respectifs de l'action humaine (le choix), de l'inter-
vention divine ou du destin (exécution de ce choix) et du tirage au sort
(hasard); et celle de la conception aristotélicienne du έφ' ήμίν, pensé à partir
de DI13 comme non-nécessaire et identifié à l'action humaine, dont la réalisa-
tion et les conséquences sont pour leur part assimilées au destin. Le destin, dès
lors, inclut tout, mais certaines choses à titre d'hypothèses (nos choix et actions
identifiées au έφ' ήμίν) et d'autres à titre de conséquences (leurs effets). Le
έφ ήμίν est donc inclus dans le destin, mais non soumis au destin, ce qui per-
met, comme le note E. Eliasson, d'éviter les « conséquences déterministes de
la théorie stoïcienne ». Sur ce point, voir également S. Bobzien (art. cit.), qui
montre la façon dont, à travers cette reprise, la notion de έφ ήμίν se trouvera
subordonnée au contingent et, plus précisément, à ce qui arrive non pas la plu-
part du temps ou rarement, mais à ce qui arrive « en part égale », que Némésius
(De la nature de l'homme, 104. 6.7; 114.21.2), comme Plutarque (Du destin,
571 c-d), identifient à ce que nous sommes capables de faire et son opposé.
Dans cette tradition, elle montre donc que le concept de έφ' ήμίν se trouve
pensé à partir de trois sources aristotéliciennes : la question du délibérable
(EN III 4); le concept de possibilité double en sa relation à la puissance
rationnelle (DI 13; Mét. Θ); et le problème des futurs contingents (DI 9).<br>

Publisher: FELIX MEINER VERLAG<br>

Author(s): Serra Alice Mara<br>
Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Abstract: The present study examines Adorno's critique of Husserl and Heidegger by asking whether one can find a systematic equivalent for Adorno's notion of a ‚spiritual experience‘ in the works of the two phenomenological thinkers. This question is answered affirmatively. The first part summarizes Adorno's critique of Husserl and Heidegger; the second analyzes the notion of ‚spiritual experience‘ in Adorno's negative dialectics; the third part explains in which sense one can speak of a ‚spiritual experience‘ in Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology; the final part describes the main differences of a ‚spiritual experience‘ in negative dialectics and in phenomenology, i. e. on the one hand the originally epistemological approach of phenomenology and the originally practical approach of negative dialectics and on the other hand the attitude with regards towards metaphysics.<br>

Author(s): Bonnemann Jens<br>
Abstract: In ethics, when discussing problems of justice and a just social existence one question arises obviously: What is the normal case of the relation between I and you we start from? In moral philosophy, each position includes basic socio–anthropological convictions in that we understand the other, for example, primarily as competitor in the fight for essential resources or as a partner in communication. Thus, it is not the human being as isolated individual, or as specimen of the human species or socialised member of a historical society what needs to be understood. Instead, the individual in its relation to the other or others has been studied in phenomenology and the philosophy of dialogue of the twentieth century. In the following essay I focus on Martin Buber's and Jean–Paul Sartre's theories of intersubjectivity which I use in order to explore the meaning of recognition and disrespect for an individual. They offer a valuable contribution to questions of practical philosophy and the socio–philosophical diagnosis of our time.<br>

Abstract: Why is the problem of beginning – much discussed in literary scholarship – not dealt with in similar depth by historians? This article attempts an answer to this question, and does so in three ways. First, it examines literary scholarship on textual openings, showing the various ways in which the beginning is given significance. Then, it examines and challenges the common presentation of historical discourse as distinct from fiction. Finally, it examines two sets of data: the openings of 100 historical monographs are analysed for their 'fictionality', and the openings of 200 research articles are analysed for their rhetorical structures.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): KNIGHT DEBORAH<br>
Abstract: Intentional, 'commonsense,' or 'folk' psychology is, as Jerry Fodor has remarked, ubiquitous. Explanations of what we say and do in terms of our reasons for acting are the stock in trade of intentional psychology. But there is a question whether explanations in terms of reasons are properly explanatory. Donald Davidson and Daniel Dennett, to name two, have defended intentional psychology and its reason-explanations. Still, many philosophers — including Fodor, Davidson and Dennett — fail to pay due attention to the narrative basis of such agent-centered accounts of action. In this paper, I argue that psychological explanation is an agent-centered, narrative-based interpretive practice. To make my case, I present a poetics of psychological explanation: seven elements which collectively describe what makes psychological explanations work. Narrative form allows us to represent the temporal arc of agents' actions — as well as the temporal arc of their reasoning about their actions, both prospective and retrospective. It allows us to negotiate between the canonical and the exceptional in human experience, and thus to account for actions that strike us as puzzling or unusual — whether the puzzle originates in our suboptimal understanding or the agent's suboptimal reasoning. And it allows us to juxtapose different perspectives on any action. Such juxtapositioning gives us a mechanism for coming to see how an action that strikes us as misguided might have been construed by the agent as reasonable given her understanding of her circumstances. After establishing the seven elements of the poetics, I address the objection that narrative-based accounts of intentional action are not properly explanatory.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the relativistic view according to which the interpretation of texts is a matter of opinion and one interpretation is as good as any other. It clarifies the question by establishing precise understandings of texts and interpretations and by introducing various distinctions between different kinds of interpretations based on their function. It argues that not all kinds of interpretations are relativistic, although all interpretations are relative, and that even those interpretations that are relativistic are not so in the same ways.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i24439507<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): CHRISTMAN JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article I critically discuss a claim made by several writers in philosophy and the social sciences that for an individual to count as a person, a single personality, or the subject of a life, the experiences of the subject in question must take a narrative form. I argue that narrativity is a misleading and, in some ways of understanding it, implausible condition of what it is that adds unity to personhood and personality. I pursue this critique by considering canonical accounts of narrativity in philosophy and literary studies. I consider those connections between events that must hold for the sequence to be considered a narrative: causal, teleological, and thematic connections. I argue that for each of these, the condition that experiential sequences (for a given subject) must have this structure is empty: any life sequence that is reflected upon in an interpretive spirit can meet it. What the condition of narrativity amounts to, then, is the more basic requirement that the person must be able to look upon the factors and events of her life with a certain interpretive reflection, whether or not those factors and events have any particular narrative unity in a traditional sense.<br>

Abstract: For anthropologists working on the topic of human rights, fieldwork often consists of collecting narratives documenting experiences of violence and loss. Drawing on research with human organizations in Argentina, this article questions this methodological focus that is often related to human rights activism. While these narratives are often treated as organic accounts, they are also products of the human rights movement. Analyses that fail to address this larger institutional context may end up reproducing conventionally held knowledge. By exploring the larger interconnections between narrative, human rights and trauma, I conclude by questioning the prevalent normative assumptions about narrative. Pour l'anthropologue travaillant sur le sujet des droits humains, le travail de terrain consiste souvent à recueillir des récits documentant des expériences de violence et de perte. À partir de recherches menées auprès d'organismes de défense des droits humains en Argentine, cet article interroge ce parti-pris méthodologique qu'on associe souvent au militantisme pour les droits humains. Alors que ces récits sont souvent traités comme des comptes-rendus organiques, ils sont aussi des produits du mouvement pour les droits humains. Les analyses qui omettent de tenir compte de ce contexte institutionnel plus étendu peuvent finir par reproduire des connaissances conventionnellement admises. En explorant les interconnexions plus étendues entre les récits, les droits humains et les traumatismes, je conclus en remettant en question les a priori normatifs courants relatifs aux récits.<br>

Abstract: Le présent article s'inscrit dans le prolongement d'une recherche en cours portant sur la compréhension et l'analyse des usages de jeux vidéo en ligne par des personnes en situation de handicap. En soulignant les apports épistémiques et méthodologiques d'une ethnographie en ligne, il pointe les limites heuristiques de la classique distinction entre un monde supposé réel qui se verrait redoublé par son pendant virtuel. L'exemple précis des jeux vidéo permet ici non seulement de questionner la dichotomie virtuel / réel mais aussi la définition traditionnelle du jeu élaborée à partir du modèle de la règle distincte de son effectuation concrète. L'analyse des pratiques ludiques de personnes en situation de handicap pointe enfin la nécessité d'une attention portée sur les modes d'appropriation corporelle d'un dispositif techno-communicationnel. En conséquence, il s'agit d'envisager les formes d'expériences vidéo-ludiques comme des « instances de procuration » autorisant l'exploration sensible de mondes moins disjoints les uns des autres qu'en interaction constante. This article is a continuation of ongoing research to understand the uses of online gaming by people with physical disabilities. By emphasizing the epistemic and methodological contributions of online ethnography, it points to the heuristic limits of the traditional distinction between a supposedly real world and that which would be repeated in the virtual. The specific use of video games in this example, makes it possible not only to question the virtual–real dichotomy, but also to question the traditional definition of the game which starts from the premise that the rule is distinct from its concrete execution. Analysis of the recreational practices of disabled people also points to the need for attention to modes of bodily appropriation of techno-communication devices. In the end, it is a question of considering video entertainment experiences like "instances of proxy," authorizing the sensitive exploration~<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Gordon Lewis R.<br>
Abstract: In celebration of the fortieth anniversary of CODESRIA, an institution from the Global South devoted to taking responsibility for the production of social science knowledge, this article explores what it means to pursue such a task under the threat of colonial imposition at methodological and disciplinary levels, which, the author argues, carries dangers of disciplinary decadence marked by the fetishisation of method. The author offers alternatives through what he calls 'a teleological suspension' of disciplinarity, and raises the question not only of the decolonisation of knowledge but also norms. Pour célébrer le quarantième anniversaire du CODESRIA, une institution des pays du Sud dévouée dans la production de connaissances en sciences sociales, cet article explore les implications de mener une telle tâche sous la menace de l'emprise coloniale à des niveaux méthodologiques et disciplinaires, qui, selon l'auteur, provoque des dangers sur la décadence disciplinaire marquée par la divination de la méthode. L'auteur propose des alternatives à travers ce qu'il appelle « une suspension téléologique » de l'interdisciplinarité, et pose la question non seulement de la décolonisation de la connaissance, mais aussi celle des normes.<br>

Abstract: Since their arrival in France in the early 1960s, former settlers of Algeria have developed an array of private and public "sites of memory" projects that have remained unnoticed in wider French society or have been interpreted uncharitably. This article offers a new perspective on these projects. Informed by Maurice Halbwachs' concern with the material supports for collective memory and Sigmund Freud's insights on loss, I reinterpret them as stages in a work of mourning, and offer new insights on the wider question of France's relationship to its colonial past.<br>

Abstract: C'est la position défendue par une nouvelle fondation, Pro-Transilvania, créée en septembre 1998 par un jeune jour-
naliste roumain de Cluj-Napoca, Sabin Gherman. Parmi ses objectifs figurent l'autonomie administrative de la Transylvanie
et « la renaissance des valeurs spirituelles purement transylvaines ». Sa capacité d'attraction dans la population transylvaine
reste limitée. Voir son article « M-am sàturat de Romania » [J'en ai assez de la Roumanie], Monitorulde Cluj, 16 septembre
1998. La même opinion est soutenue de manière beaucoup plus élaborée par Gusztâv Molnâr, « Problema transilvanà » [La
question transylvaine], Altera, n° 8,1998, pp. 42-66. L'auteur défend l'idée que seule une réforme profonde de l'État-nation
roumain, impliquant une révision, inspirée du modèle écossais, du caractère unitaire de l'État inscrit dans la Constitution
peut ouvrir la voie à une modernisation réussie et à l'intégration européenne de la Roumanie. Les commentaires suscités
par cette étude et la réponse de l'auteur sont réunis dans Gabriel Andreescu, Gusztâv Molnâr (dir.), op. cit.<br>

Abstract: Jerome Bruner, Pourquoi nous racontons-nous des histoires? Le récit au fondement de la culture et de l'identité
individuelle, Paris, Pocket, 2005, p. 29. Le critique littéraire Bruce Robbins insiste lui aussi sur l'aspect décisif de
la narration dans la mise en valeur de l'expérience du populaire. Il place ainsi au centre de sa problématique la
question des conditions rendant possible la mise en valeur de l'origine sociale : « Quoi que cela représente pour les
sociologues, je considère que la mobilité sociale est aussi une histoire. Et je suppose que, dans cette histoire, l'état
initial de misère économique représente une sorte de capital pervers, un capital qui ne peut être encaissé que lorsqu'il
est donné à voir aux autres. (...) Si la pauvreté ostentatoire est un placement stratégique dans un jeu narratif, on est
alors curieux de savoir de quelle sorte de jeu il s'agit. Pourquoi l'auditeur se sent-il obligé de reconnaître que des
points ont été marqués? Est-ce simplement que plus la distance gravie est grande, plus on a le droit de se vanter de
sa réussite? ». Bruce Robbins, Upward Mobility and the Common Good: Toward a Literary History of the Welfare State,

Abstract: Les années 1960 apparaissent comme un moment de profonde remise en question du système scolaire (particulièrement du modèle secondaire), tant du fait des réformes initiées par les premiers gouvernements de la Cinquième République que de la dynamique des débats publics de cette décennie, couronnée par le colloque d'Amiens, en mars 1968. Or l'étude systématique du discours tenu dans la presse sur ce sujet montre que l'affichage zélé d'un consensus apparent masque de profondes incertitudes quant au modèle scolaire qu'il faudrait inventer en remplacement du système présenté comme unanimement condamné. On constate également que ce large accord ignore l'importance des pesanteurs conservatrices, qui, même marginalisées, peuvent facilement alimenter des doutes, qui ne manqueront pas de s'exprimer si une situation conflictuelle vient à se présenter. The 1960's appear as a moment when real doubts concerning the French School system (particularly the traditional Secondary model) came to light, partly because of the reforms initiated by the first governments of the Fifth Republic but also as a result of the state of the discussions arising over that decade, and coming to a head at the colloquium held in Amiens in March 1968. However, the systematic study of the discourse held in the newspapers about this subject reveals that the zealous show of an apparent consensus masked deep uncertainties relating to the school model which needed to be invented to replace the widely condemned system. We also notice that this broad agreement ignored the importance of conservative obstacles which, even when marginalised, could easily fuel doubts, and would certainly be expressed as soon as a conflictual situation arose.<br>

authority, in Journal of the History of Philosophy, juilllet 1996, vol. 34, n°3,
pp. 409 sq. Il faut ajouter que la parole kantienne « Ne devenez point esclaves
des hommes. Ne souffrez pas que votre droit soit impunément foulé aux pieds
par les autres » a dans le texte de Kant une portée limitée. Elle avertit contre la
perte de l'indépendance économique de l'individu (car les dettes peuvent
mener à ce qu'on devienne mendiant), contre la génuflexion devant les images
et contre un comportement trop révérencieux par rapport aux hommes
(lorsqu'il exprime par exemple la différence des états, la courtoisie mutuelle
entre égaux étant en revanche compatible avec l'estime de soi-même). Ces
formes d'estime n'ont aucune dimension politique et Kant ne provoque pas à
une résistance dans le cadre de la défense contre l'injustice. Et pourtant, les
analyses de Patoika et Arntzen peuvent s'appuyer sur l'œuvre de Kant dans
son ensemble. Du point de vue d'ensemble, le droit à la résistance chez Kant
n'est pas seulement une question de légalité, mais de moralité.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>

Author(s): Collicutt Joanna<br>
Abstract: This article is a wide-ranging consideration of the role that contemporary academic psychology might play in the study of the Bible. I begin by examining the historical reasons for suspicion of psychology within the community of biblical scholarship, focusing on several perennial objections. Having addressed these objections, I go on to set out a framework for the legitimate use of psychology in enhancing understanding of the process of production and reception of the biblical texts, and of elucidating their meaning. Finally, I suggest that some contemporary methodological quality-control systems from psychology might inform the question of what constitutes a good reading of a particular text. I explore this issue further by using the example of trauma processing in relation to the New Testament, suggesting that if the text is to be received as transformative, a good reading is likely to be dissonant, challenging, or ugly.<br>

Abstract: The mice folk's reception of Josefine's art in Kafka's story "Josefine, die Sängerin oder Das Volk der Mäuse" reflects the reception on the part of Kraus's audience of his literary art with its "meta-ideological" cultural analysis. This analysis was recognized by the primary members of the Frankfurt School for Social Research and is easily demonstrable in Kraus's analytical treatment of the Social Democrats in the short essay "Hüben und Drüben." The question of the efficacy of Kraus's analysis is better posed as a question of the reception on the part of the mice folk of the meta-ideological analysis undertaken.<br>

Author(s): Tengelyi László<br>
Abstract: Truth is attributed by hermeneutical phenomenology not only to science but also to art and literature. According to Ricoeur, its veritable bearer is the expression of experience that can take artistic and literary forms as well as scientific ones. However, truth in this sense cannot be defined as a correspondence with a ready-made reality, nor can it be reduced to any internal coherence in our knowledge of the world. What is, then, its precise meaning in this context? The two terms mentioned in the title—'redescription' and 'refiguration' of reality—indicate the two answers Ricoeur gives to this question. The similarities and the differences between these two answers are submitted to an inquiry in the following paper, which, relying upon Ricoeur, adumbrates the outlines of a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach to truth.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: My aim in this memorial paper is to recall two essential Ricoeurean themes that underlie his entire philosophical orientation and that respond well to specific challenges today from postmodern deconstruction. At question is whether Ricoeur's account of sign in language and the living present in time can adequately respond to and meet the recent challenge from postmodern deconstruction, which radically challenges the very root of his phenomenological and hermeneutic orientation: the priority of the semantic in language and the priority of the living present. Although Ricoeur and Derrida will be seen to address the same problems of decentering consciousness, their accounts, although agreeing on importnat issues, quickly become mutually exclusive and deconstruction becomes a challenge to Ricoeurean hermeneutics. I will turn first to the postmodern deconstruction of Jacques Derrida before turning to Ricoeur's response with a more viable view of language, sense, and lived time.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24659531<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Dostal Robert J.<br>
Abstract: Against the background of Gadamer's hermeneutics of trust, for which the primary concern of the hermeneutical enterprise is the matter under discussion, the Sache, this essay raises the question of Gadamer's treatment of irony. Gadamer and Gadamerians have criticized the hermeneutics of suspicion—a hermeneutics that always looks under the surface of what is said to see what is hidden. This would seem to make irony a problematic aspect of texts and discourse for a Gadamerian hermeneutics. Nowhere in Gadamer's corpus can we find an extensive discussion of irony, but Gadamer does raise the question of irony in a provocative way in several important junctures. This essay contrasts Gadamer's treatment of irony to that of Leo Strauss and Jacques Derrida. It explores why for Gadamer irony does not call for a hermeneutics of suspicion.<br>

Author(s): Milan Paul<br>
Abstract: I begin with the hypothesis that Jacques Derrida's Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins is in a way the illustration of Speech and Phenomena and therefore Derrida's critique of phenomenology, intuition, perception, and seeing. I also want to show in this regard parallels with both Husserl and Kant. I emphasize that what is at issue in Memoirs of the Blind is art, visual arts; and in the great thematic richness of this text, I note the high points as well as the low points concerning the arts of the "visible." The fundamental question is: Does Derrida "see" the drawing, the painting, and indeed listen to the music?<br>

Author(s): AKRAM MUHAMMAD<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses the issue of the relationship between theology and religious studies, drawing on certain principles of Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutical theory. Leaving aside differences between Gadamer and his critics, it is argued that his rehabilitation of prejudice, authority and tradition as well as his notions of the fusion of horizons and intersubjective dialogue put into question the utility of dichotomous categories like subjective-objective, normative-descriptive, and insider-outsider in approaches to religion. It is suggested, therefore, that a clearer distinction between theology and religious studies can be established in terms of the subject matter of these disciplines rather than on the basis of their methodological principles. However, as both disciplines venture to understand at least some overlapping dimensions of religious phenomena which make up their common subject matter, to this extent, they can be viewed as dialogical partners and as providing different but complementary perspectives on religion.<br>

Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's conception of history, see in particular A New Critique, vol. 2, part 1,
chs. 3 and 4; see further his Roots of Western Culture, ch. 1, §§ 14-25; and In the Twilight of
Western Thought, chs. 3 and 4.
With regard to Vollenhoven's conception of history, see especially his Isagooge Philoso-
phiae, §§ 113-34, pp. 74-98. In 'Problemen van de tijd in onze kring' Vollenhoven notes that
he 'already in 1929 in a debate wih Dooyeweerd openly differed with him in opinion regard-
ing the modal character of history'. Naturally, it remains a question whether Dooyeweerd's
conception of history, substantively speaking, is not more than modal. In Dutch he preferred
to describe this modal history not as 'cultural development' but more broadly as 'development
of civilization' (beschavingsontwikkeling). Compare, e.g., A New Critique, vol. 1, pp. 267, 362-
65 with De Wijsbegeerte der Wetsidee, vol. 2, pp. 187, 296-300; see also p. 143.<br>

Abstract: Pannenberg, as we have noted, deals with the contradictions involved by making the
tension between egocentricity and exocentricity the ontic nature of humanness. Simul-
taneously exocentricity both validates and invalidates egocentricity. "But even if human
beings are in this sense sinners by nature, this does not mean that their nature as human
beings is sinful" (p. 107). The cardinal question is whether such a coincidentia oppositorum is
able to do full justice to creaturely goodness, human freedom and responsibility. See Brian
Walsh, "A Critical Review of Pannenberg's Anthropology in Theological Perspective" in Christian
Scholar's Review XV (1986), 247-259.<br>

Abstract: I cannot go into the question whether substances can be such self-causing causes and
consequently how agency could be conceived in a metaphysics of substances. Moreland and
McRae (2000) argue for such an approach in their important work on anthropology and eth-
ics. I conclu with their spirit (a defense of the notion of soul in a biblical sense), without shar-
ing their mind-bodv dualism and the metaphysics behind it. One could make a case, I think, of
the statement that in their account the substantiveness of the body gradually disappears, in
spite of their body — soul dualism. Another issue is the distinctness between biblical and scien-
tific language. An important argument in almost all dualist accounts is the séparation between
body and 'soul' at death. I am not convinced that this 'séparation' can be used as an argument
for body-soul dualism as a philosophical position. Is what occurs at the moment of death not
just as mysterious as what occurs at the moment of conception (and in God's act of création)?
By introducing the biblical notion of the soul in a scientific discourse on mind-body dualism,
one is coerced to adapt the biblical meaning of the concept to the prevailing ontology of sub-
stances and entities; and this almost always implies not only réduction (loss of meaning), but
also adoption of certain conceptual characteristics inherent in the metaphysics of substances
(such as separateness of substances; or self-sustenance; or being bearer of a bundie of fea-
tures).<br>

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: L'article examine la lecture, par Hegel, de la critique kantienne de la métaphysique de l'âme et la conception hégélienne de l'âme comme « esprit-nature ». La question est de savoir ce que Hegel retient de la critique kantienne et en quoi, cependant, elle lui semble méthodologiquement inappropriée. Plus fondamentalement, il s'agit de saisir en quel sens les prédicats reconnus à l'âme dans la métaphysique dogmatique se trouvent « relevés » dans la conception hégélienne de l'esprit. The paper considers Hegel's reading of Kant's critique of the metaphysics of the soul and Hegel's conception of the soul as "natural spirit". The question is what Hegel retains from the Kantian critique and why it seems to him, nevertheless, to be methodologically inappropriate. More fundamentally, the aim of the paper is to grasp in which sense the predicates of the soul according dogmatic metaphysics are "sublated" in Hegelian conception of spirit.<br>

Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342983<br>

Author(s): Platt Fred<br>
Abstract: Psychohistory is affected by problems similar to those affecting the broader discipline of history, psychoanalysis, and the social sciences generally: the heterogeneous composition of social movements, the phenomenon of discontinuity, and the capacity of people actively to construct versions of the world from their own idiosyncratic conflicts and in the context of the many different social locations they occupy. In particular, answers to the key question, how the social world is related to mind or events to cognitive and affective responses, seem as remote as ever. At the same time, ironically, a number of prominent social theorists, compelled to acknowledge the failure of rational choice and resource mobilization theories, have expressed a renewed interest in issues of collective identities, norms, values, moral obligations and transgressions, that is, in issues that have been central to psychohistory from the beginning. Historians no doubt will try to follow the paths taken by theorists, as they have in the past, but it is uncertain what paths they, in turn, will take.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Article Title: Hayden White: Beyond Irony<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): White Ewa<br>
Abstract: A crisis of our age that is usually identified with the loss of the sacred was one of the causes of the fall into irony in the nineteenth century. In the case of historians, as Hayden White has shown in Metahistory, this irony was caused by a "bitterness" stemming from the failure of reality to fulfill their expectations. An ironic apprehension of the world arose in an atmosphere of social breakdown or cultural decline. A current stage of irony manifests itself in a doubt as to the capacity of language to grasp reality. Thus we live in a "prison house of language." An intellectual parlor-game produces "second-hand knowledge" that cannot satisfy the needs of post-postmodern men and women still looking for another metanarrative. Therefore, the main purpose of this essay is to answer the question: how can we go beyond irony? This text is a "post-postmodern post mortem to postmodernism." I am grateful to post-modernism for many things, especially for giving me an alternative apprehension of the world in terms of difference and continuity rather than binary oppositions, but I am tired of ontological insecurity and epistemological chaos. I need order. I miss metanarrative. In trying to break with some modern/postmodern "principles" and retain within my discourse the premodernist perspective, I follow the current trend in the humanities. We observe at present the breakdown of methodology and the rise of a more poetic approach in the human sciences. Evidence of this phenomenon is the more autobiographical form of writing in anthropology (James Clifford, Clifford Geertz) and a more literary style in historical writing (Natalie Zemon Davis, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Simon Schama). This trend is associated with a revaluation of the subjective aspects of research. Perhaps, and I would welcome it, it also could be identified with a reappearance of a Collingwoodian idea of history as human self-knowledge, knowledge about human nature, knowledge about "what it is to be a man... wha~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Carr Steven G.<br>
Abstract: If, as many historians and theorists now believe, narrative is the form proper to historical explanation, this raises the problem of the terms in which such narratives are to be evaluated. Without a clear account of evaluation, the status of historical knowledge (both in itself and in all those social, political, and other contexts in which appeal to historical explanation is made) remains obscure. Beginning with the view, found in Hayden White and others, that historical narrative constitutes a meaning not reducible to the factual content it engages, this essay argues that such meaning can arise only through a synthesis of cognitive and normative discourses. Narrative combines "heterogeneous" language games in such a way that neither appeal to "truth content" nor to "justice" suffices to decide the question of which of two competing historical explanations is, as a whole, superior. Examining in critical detail the opposed positions on this issue articulated by two recent theorists-Frank Ankersmit ("narrative idealism") and David Carr ("narrative realism")-the paper concludes that the debate between those who hold that historical narratives should be judged in essentially cognitive terms and those who hold that they should be judged in essentially political terms cannot be resolved and that a philosophical view of historical narrative that is neither realist nor idealist needs to be developed.<br>

It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Abstract: The focus of this article is the theory of integration advanced by Alan Cairns in his book, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian State". Cairns' theory has had a mixed reception since its publication. Like much scholarship and public policy in the Aboriginal rights field, "Citizens Plus" has attracted strong proponents and opponents. At present "Citizens Plus" remains one of the primary competitors vying for influence in guiding the postcolonial reconfiguration of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian state and civil society on terms of justice that may be perceived as legitimate by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. The prime alternative, as conceived by both Cairns and his critics, is the nation-to-nation constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The author provides a political theoretical reading of "Citizens Plus". She seeks to disclose the normative and conceptual structure of Cairns' argument and to situate Cairns' theory in the context of debates concerning the future of Aboriginal peoples and the constitution of Canada. This reading foregrounds an alternative interpretation of the relationship between "Citizens Plus" and the constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which makes it possible to see them as complementary rather than opposed constitutional visions. The author also raises broader questions concerning the reasons for continuing the search, at the heart of Cairns' work, for a post-colonial theory and praxis of normative integration in diverse societies, and the conditions of the possibility of such a theory and praxis. Ultimately the author argues that whether one agrees or disagrees with Cairns' prescription, at a minimum "Citizens Plus" should be understood as raising a fundamental question to which multinational constitutional theory must respond. /// Le présent article a pour objet d'examiner la théorie avancée par Alan Cairns dans son ouvrage, "Ci~<br>

Abstract: From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.<br>

Author(s): Radford Luis<br>
Abstract: Meaning is one of the recent terms which have gained great currency in mathematics education. It is generally used as a correlate of individuals' intentions and considered a central element in contemporary accounts of knowledge formation. One important question that arises in this context is the following: if, in one way or another, knowledge rests on the intrinsically subjective intentions and deeds of the individual, how can the objectivity of conceptual mathematical entities be guaranteed? In the first part of this paper, both Peirce's and Husserl's theories of meaning are discussed in light of the aforementioned question. I examine their attempts to reconcile the subjective dimension of knowing with the alleged transcendental nature of mathematical objects. I argue that transcendentalism, either in Peirce's or Husserl's theory of meaning, leads to an irresolvable tension between subject and object. In the final part of the article, I sketch a notion of meaning and conceptual objects based on a semiotic-cultural approach to cognition and knowledge which gives up transcendentalism and instead conveys the notion of contextual objectivity.<br>

Abstract: This paper compares Maurice Halbwachs's theory of collective memory to the most typical articulation of group memory in France before the twentieth century, especially from the late sixteenth century to the end of the eighteenth century. It argues that the twentieth-century notion of collective memory, largely based on Halbwachs's work, differs significantly from earlier articulations of this concept and that these two conceptions are modeled on two different types of personal memory. Finally, it suggests that, given these differences, we should question whether our modern concept of collective memory is a useful tool in analyzing early modern French texts.<br>

Author(s): Taylor Janelle S.<br>
Abstract: The onset of dementia raises troubling questions. Does the person with dementia still recognize you? If someone cannot recognize you, can they still care about you? This essay takes such questions as the entry point for a broader inquiry into recognition, its linkages to care, and how claims to social and political "recognition" are linked to, or premised on, the demonstrated capacity to "recognize" people and things. In the words and actions of her severely impaired mother, the author finds guidance toward a better, more compassionate question to ask about dementia: how can we best strive to "keep the cares together"?<br>

Abstract: In medical anthropological research, the question of suffering has been a topic of salient interest mostly from two theoretical viewpoints: those of endurance and of agency. The concept "suffering" derives its origins from two etymological roots, those of suffering-souffrance-sofferanza and of misery-misère-miseria. According to the first approach, that of "endurance" and founded largely on Judeo-Christian theology, suffering is regarded as an existential experience at the borders of human meaning making. The question then is: how to endure, how to suffer? The latter view, that of "agency," follows the Enlightenment, and later the Marxist view on mundane suffering, misery, and the modern question of how to avoid or diminish it. This article follows the lines of the second approach, but my aim is also to try to build a theoretical bridge between the two. I ask whether agency would be understood as a culturally shared and interpreted modes of enduring, and if so, which conceptual definition of agency applies in this context? I theorize the relationship between suffering and agency using Ernesto de Martino's notion la crisi della presenza. In line with Pierre Bourdieu, I think that in people's lives, there may be sufferings in a plural form, as a variety of sufferings. The article is based on a one-year long fieldwork in Finnish North Karelia.<br>

Abstract: La place de la musique dans À la recherche du temps perdu a suscité nombre de commentaires. Le présent propos connecte ces points à un débat interne aux musicologues français. Si certains l'envisage contre toute interpretation subjective, d'autres entendent la recentrer sur deux axes majeurs: 1) le statut d'écrit littéraire 2) révélant l'expérience musicale d'autre part. Or, de récents articles insèrent Proust à ce débat. Il s'agit de comprendre en quoi réactualiser écrivain ayant fait d'un roman un projet esthétique où la question du langage est centrale peut relancer la discussion du lien musique-langage, ici en un rapport où s'adjoint la musicologie, elle-même objet d'une dissension. /// The work À la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust has provoked numerous commentaries which referred to the importance conferred upon music in this novel. In this, interest was pointed either at the music sources, the listening, or the connections between the architecture of the novel and the musical structure of the composer Vinteuil, the character in the novel. This article offers the articulation of those debates which occur within the French musicology which question its objects in the way that some consider it as a science or discipline at intersection of others, which has to return necessarily within sciences called exact and/or humane, opposed to all subjective interpretations; the other try to center again musicologist's activities in two main axes: the status of a writing with a literary aspiration on one side, and a report about musical experience on the other. In this, recent articles were putting Marcel Proust in the focus of a contemporary debate, trying to understand in which way the reactualisation of a writer - who out of one work had made an aesthetical project in which the question of language became central - can renew the discussion about connections between music and language, but this time within a triangular connection in which musicology is added, whi~<br>

Abstract: This essay traces the involution of anthropological understanding from the 1950s to the present. It is shown that as the conception of "doing ethnography" changed from sensing patterns to reading texts, and from reading texts to writing culture, so too did the content of anthropological knowledge change from being multi-sensory to being self-centred. The essay also proposes a way of escaping the tunnel-vision of contemporary (post-modern) ethnography — namely, by treating cultures as constituted by a particular interplay of the senses which the ethnographer must simulate before making any attempt to describe or evoke the culture under study. /// Cet article trace l'enchevêtrement qu'a subi l'étude de l'anthropologie depuis les années cinquante à nos jours. L'auteur démontre que le concept de "faire de l'ethnographie" a changé radicalement — de la perception sensorielle à la lecture des textes et de cette lecture à l'acte d'écrire une culture. Également, le contenu des connaissances anthropologiques a subi un changement du multi-sensoriel à l'égocentrique. L'article propose comment s'éloigner du champ de vue plutôt étroit de l'ethnographie contemporaine (dite post-moderne) en suggérant que les ethnographes traitent les cultures telles que constituées par l'action réciproque particulière des sens qui doivent être simulés avant que les ethnographes puissent essayer de décrire ou d'évoquer la culture en question.<br>

Article Title: Language and the Making of Place: A Narrative-Descriptive Approach<br>
Publisher: Association of American Geographers<br>
Issue: i323950<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Tuan Yi-Fu<br>
Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Abstract: Contrairement à l'opinion reçue, Le Clézio n'écrit pas des livres paisibles, nourris de tourisme tropical. Au contraire ses récits des années 1980 et 1990 sont engagés dans la réalité quotidienne et soulèvent de véritables questions de société: notamment la question de l'immigration clandestine. L'analyse minutieuse du développement de l'immigré clandestin à travers cinq nouvelles et romans permet de cerner les deux facettes et les deux fonctions presque opposées de ce personnage. D'une part l'immigration clandestine est présentée par l'auteur comme la figure emblématique de la modernité: comme un arrachement violent au particularisme en direction d'un universel globalisé et problématisé. Mais d'autre part l'immigration clandestine apparaît comme une sorte d'ascèse, d'épreuve et d'initiation symbolique sur le chemin du sacré. Pour conclure, nous montrons que Poisson d'or est à dix-sept ans d'intervalle une récriture ambiguë de Désert: une récriture plus sombre et plus désespérée qui exhibe les mécanismes sociaux de l'exclusion et qui révèle les tensions accrues au sein de la société française au cours de la dernière décennie du vingtième siècle.<br>

Journal Title: Journal of Qur'anic Studies<br>
Article Title: Qur'an and Science: A Hermeneutical Approach / ‮القرآن والعلم: منهج تفسيري‬<br>

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Abstract: Le mot « traduction » est à l'honneur: le philosophe Paul Ricœur l'érige en principe éthique, la « traductologie » se pose en nouvelle discipline littéraire et un courant de la sociologie des sciences le prend pour paradigme. Au-delà de ce dernier usage analogique, n'y a-t-il pas place pour une sociologie de la traduction qui ne soit pas seulement une sociographie des traducteurs amateurs ou professionnels, ni même une annexe fonctionnelle de la théorie des champs culturels et de leurs échanges inégaux? L'événement éditorial que constitue une nouvelle traduction littéraire de la Bible offre ainsi au sociologue matière à associer ses dimensions linguistiques, institutionnelles et relationnelles pour déterminer une « configuration traductive » exemplaire de la rencontre équivoque entre mondes littéraires, médiatiques et religieux en contexte de modernité avancée. The word « translation » has pride of place at the present time: the philosopher Paul Ricœur sets it up as an ethical principle, « translation studies » become a new international subject and the sociology of sciences takes it up as paradigm. Beyond this last figurative use, the question is how can we draw up a sociology of translation apart from studies of professional sets and transnational cultural exchanges? The New Bible Translation, a recent literary event in the French-speaking world, gives matter for combining linguistic, institutional and relational points of view. This translation case as a sociological configuration accounts for this ambiguous meeting point — at the crossroads between literature, religion and publishing — in advanced modernity.<br>

Abstract: This article reflects on the question of the disappearance of the individual subject of experience in Beckett's writing, and its gradual replacement by an anonymous subject. After The Unnamable, the voice becomes increasingly ambiguous or plural. It can no longer be ascribed to any distinct individual. In the light of Paul Ricœur's analysis of narrative identity, I intend to show how Beckett's work gradually goes, through the notion of alterity, beyond the problematic of subjectivity. By suspending the question who, the Beckettian text appears to be more and more organized by a missing presence, and moves toward a gradual reinforcement of the notion of past.<br>

Abstract: The issue of contingency in narratives has long been of interest to the disciplines of philosophy, theoretical history and literary sciences. More recently, the question of how societies conceptualize and try to come to grips with the occurrence of the "expected unexpected" has gained an increasing importance both in anthropology and cultural studies generally. Built around a narrative—a more or less "classic" example of a "fighting story", well known in Northern Aboriginal Australia—the article demonstrates how the oft-repeated tale reflects not only an experience of the social but also a (desired) potential for transformation. Using insights drawn from theories that emphasize the presentational (as opposed to the representational) qualities of the symbolic, the paper shows how the immanent capacity for conflict is thematized in an "olden time story". The narrative may not resolve the problems it addresses; however, through its symbolic presentations it nevertheless serves as a multi-faceted means to confront and even to make sense—if only temporarily—of the incongruities and the paradoxes of daily life.<br>

Abstract: I take up the question of political identity as the continuity of a community across time. In particular, I examine what it means to think of a political community as the subject of attribution across generations, that is, what is meant when it is made the bearer of responsibility for the past and a custodian of the future. In doing that, I focus on identity, memory, and responsibility and discuss that cluster of concepts using as an illustrative example the idea of constitutional patriotism and its relationship to the past.<br>

Abstract: As Neil Smith argues, in the 1970s Rostow's Stages and other models of development and modernization "enjoyed the status of conventional wisdom" in geography departments among all but a handful of mainly "Marxist malcontents." Smith argues that "modernization was a mission, much as Christianization had been for many European colonists of the previous century." For Third World specialists, he writes, the question was not whether to sanction or advance modernization, but, rather, how to achieve this "unquestioned" good. One wonders if the same unquestioned "good" has been attached to notions of "globalization" and "sustainable development" within those same academic corridors that Smith trod in the 1970s. (

Abstract: Twelve years after the genocide, nothing has been forgotten in Rwanda. The country resembles a multiplicity of experiences, words and silences. The aim of the article is to reflect on the representations – or absence of representations – of the past. The approach is based on the ambivalence of any reference to the past. It is not a question of making a judgement in the abstract about the more or less legitimate character of the attitudes observed, but to understand the dynamics at work. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part recalls the specific aspects of the case under study. The second examines the silences that weigh upon Rwandan society. The third notes the main accounts of the past.<br>

Méditations pascaliennes). On voit à quel point est erronée
l'idée que les méthodes quantitatives seraient, par nature,

au mieux capables de répondre par oui ou non à une
question préconçue, mais incapables de déplacer les

Abstract: There are, of course, discussions of this sort in a variety of modern moral and political
theories. For example Onora O'Neill has given accounts of this issue from a strongly
Kantian perspective, and the notion of reasonableness and what it leads to plays a central
role in John Finnis's influential rearticulation of Natural Law theory. See Onora O'Neill,
'Vindicating Reason', in The Cambridge Companion to Kant, ed. Paul Guyer (Cambridge,
1992); and John Finnis, Natural Law and Natural Rights (Oxford, 1980). The beginnings
of my own approach to this question can be found in Political Theory, Modernity and
Postmodernity, Chs. 3 and 4.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i325622<br>
Date: 6 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Zeitlyn David<br>
Abstract: Some systems of divination are used to select particular sections of text, which are typically arcane and erudite, in which lies the answer to the particular, pressing problems of the client. Celebrated examples of such systems are the Chinese I Ching and the Yoruba Ifa. Werbner's work on Kalanga and Tswapong divination provides a case-study of the detailed praxis in such systems. Diviners have a multiple role when a divination technique selects a text. At each consultation they must satisfy themselves, their client, and their audience that they have followed the correct procedures to select the text. A second stage follows. The client has a particular question and the selected text was not composed as a specific answer to it. Interpretation is required to satisfy the client that the question has been answered. The diviner thus plays the role of indigenous critic, a role both similar to and different from that of literary critics in the Western tradition. The concept of `dialogic' used by Barber in her analysis of Yoruba praise poetry is taken to illustrate similarities and differences between diviner and critic.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Author(s): Church Nathan<br>
Abstract: Lucy Bregman's approach to Schreber's "Memoirs" is scrutinized and found to be based on a number of fallacious and contradictory assumptions that call her interpretation of the book as personal religious myth into question. A social constructionist approach to mythology maintained by Berger and Luckmann is advanced, suggesting that at best Schreber's work qualifies as a quasi-mythical attempt to explain the source of his personal sociopsychic suffering. The family and interpersonal dynamics of Schreber's quasi-myth are investigated. Similarities to other cases of psychotic quasi-myths are noted and a general relationship between oppressive socialization and psychotic communications is advanced, as well as a specific alternative interpretation of Schreber's work to that proposed by Bregman.<br>

Author(s): Hershberger John K.<br>
Abstract: This paper places the problem of child abuse in the perspective of evil. In so doing it calls into question the amoral assumptions of social science and human services. The current social science paradigm paradoxically dismisses evil as a real factor in the world, despite its concern for indisputably moral issues such as child abuse. The practical advantages of a perspective incorporating evil are several. Among them are a more realistic appreciation of the need for mechanisms of social control in preventing abuse, the role of confession and conversion, and the role of pastoral care as a support system for families.<br>

Abstract: Temporal lobe epilepsy and certain personality disorders often result in experiences described as "religious." TLE research suggests a possible neurological basis for such experiences. Immediately the question arises about the authenticity of these experiences as religious. An experience is authentic if it furthers the authentic growth of the subject, regardless of what triggered it. So pathology may occasion authentic religious experiences, even as history exemplifies. For practical purposes, the further question about God in religious experience is secondary. The exception, miraculous occurrences, should not be granted without sufficient reason. This approach dissolves all conflict between science and faith.<br>

Author(s): Lee Sang Uk<br>
Abstract: I will investigate in this paper what kind of "Weltanschauung" Freud suggests. Although Freud argues in the lecture XXXV, "The Question of a "Weltanschauung" (1933)," that psychoanalysis is incapable of creating a "Weltanschauung" of its own, I think that he has a certain "Weltanschauung", i.e., the aesthetic worldview, which involves his scientific, psychoanalytic, and artistic principles. Furthermore, I will explicate that Freud's aesthetic worldview is ultimately related to the "Weltanschauungen" of William James and Paul Ricoeur. I will focus particularly on their terms, "sympathetic" and "poetic," which are the crucial elements that constitute the aesthetic "Weltanschauung". Finally, I will briefly present my intention in drawing this aesthetic "Weltanschauung". I will conclude that throughout the aesthetic "Weltanschauung" we may accept that everything is precious, pertinent, and worthy to be viewed as a part and a whole, and as home (Heim).<br>

Abstract: Socrate, "Vois plutôt cette autre objection qui s'avance, et considère par où nous
l'écarterons. — Théétète : Quelle objection, donc ? — Socrate : Une de ce genre, soit la
question : Supposons qu'on soit venu à savoir quelque chose ; que de cet objet même on ait
encore, on conserve, le souvenir ; est-il possible que, à ce moment-là, quand on se le rappelle,
on ne sache pas cela même qu'on se rappelle ? [...] Mais j'ai l'air de me lancer dans un grand
discours : ce que je veux demander, c'est si une fois qu'on a appris quelque chose, on ne le
sait pas quand on se le rappelle." (Platon, Théétète, Paris, Flammarion, 1994, trad, par
M. Narcy, [163d] p. 182.) "Et comment, Socrate ? réplique Théétète, ce serait monstrueux ce
que tu dis." De cette réponse embarrassée surgit une question plus aiguë : "Sans plus tarder,
crois-tu qu'on te concédera que chez un sujet quelconque, le souvenir présent de ce qu'il a
éprouvé soit une impression semblable, pour lui qui ne l'éprouve plus, à ce qu'il a une fois
éprouvé ? Il s'en faut de beaucoup." (Ibid., [166b] p. 190.) Question insidieuse, qui entraîne
toute la problématique dans ce qui apparaîtra plus tard comme un piège, à savoir le recours
à la catégorie de similitude pour résoudre l'énigme de la présence de l'absence, énigme
commune à l'imagination et à la mémoire, comme le choix du vocable eikôn le souligne. Je
ne suivrai pas les protagonistes du dialogue dans l'examen de la solution proposée, à savoir
le modèle de l'empreinte dans la cire, laquelle ne fait que redoubler l'énigme, dans la mesure
où toutes les empreintes sont présentes, actuelles, et où il leur est demandé de se comporter
en tant que signes de leur cause, à savoir l'événement de la frappe de l'empreinte.<br>

Author(s): Jenco Leigh Kathryn<br>
Abstract: How can we conduct cross-cultural inquiry without reproducting the ethnocentric categories that prompt critique in the first place? Postcolonial and comparative political theorists have called into question the "universal" applicability of Western liberal political norms, but their critiques are drawn most often from competing Western discourses (e.g., poststructuralism) rather than from the culturally diverse traditions of scholarship whose ideas they examine. In contrast, I suggest attending to these culturally situated traditions of scholarship, especially their methods of inquiry, in addition to their substantive ideas. This method-centered approach reinterprets cross-cultural engagement, not as a tool for modifying existing parochial debates on the basis of "non-Western" cases, but as an opportunity to ask new questions through alternative frames of reference. Examining the interpretive methodologies of two classicists, I show how their methods offer not only new ideas but also new methods for the practice of political and cross-cultural theory.<br>

Issue: i27652935<br>
Date: 10 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Kliger Ilya<br>
Abstract: Ilya Kliger addresses the question of Mikhail Bakhtin's intervention in modernist discourse by taking a step back from Bakhtin's views on modernist literature and outlining instead a more general Bakhtinian conception of the modernist condition as characterized by what Kliger calls "a crisis of authorship." The article focuses on Bakhtin's early work in narratological aesthetics and situates it within the longue durée context of debates about the status of the subject of aesthetic experience and, more generally, of knowledge, debates that can provisionally be seen as originating at the end of the eighteenth century and coming to a head within the intellectual and creative milieu of twentieth-century modernism. Early Bakhtin helps us formulate a specifically modernist—by contrast with what will be called "transcendental" and "realist"—critique, a critique not limited to the field of literary analysis alone but applying to all forms of thinking that either presuppose abstract subject-object division or rely on modes of synthetic reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: This paper deals with the question of historical responsibility. It can be subdivided into whether historical responsibility exists, consequently what it is about, and then how it can be put into practice. I am raising these questions as a third-generation German against the background of the Holocaust. In this paper I unfold various views and thus dimensions of historical responsibility, which I finally complement in the form of six models of historical responsibility. These models provide a multilayered perspective on and approach to the philosophical and practical dimensions of historical responsibility and, as a consequence, are of relevance to contemporary political culture.<br>

Abstract: El texto póstumo de Maurice Halbwachs, titulado "L'expression des émotions et la société" (1947), presenta un triple interés entre otros. 1) Al descubrir la obligación social de sentir y la influencia de los grupos sociales, Maurice Halbwachs se convierte a la vez en digno sucesor de Durkheim, cercano colaborador de Marcel Mauss y también fino lector de Weber y de Simmel. 2) Al tratar la cuestión de la transmisión de las emociones, el autor reencuentra los problemas de la mémoire collective, eje de su obra, y trata la cuestión de la emoción en una temporalidad que afecta a la misma existencia y, más allá, a la transmisión intergeneracional. 3) Al insistir sobre la formalidad y la eficacia de las prácticas rituales para comprender "la expresión de las emociones", Maurice Halbwachs ofrece finalmente las vías de una posible superación de las oposiciones clásicas entre ritos y emociones o entre expresión y representación. /// The posthumous text by Maurice Halbwachs, "L'expression des émotions et la société" (1947), presents more than a triple interest. 1) When discovering the social obligation of feeling and the influence of social groups, Maurice Halbwachs becomesat the same time a worthy Durkheim successor, a close Marcel Mauss collaborator and a fine Weber and de Simmel reader. 2) Dealing with the question of transmission of emotions, the author reviews again the problems of la mémoire collective, axis of his work, and approaches the question of emotion in a temporality affecting existence itself and, beyond, the intergenerational transmission. 3) When insisting on the formality and efficiency of ritual practices to comprehend "the expression of emotions", Maurice Halbwachs offers at last the ways of a possible superation of the classical oppositions between rites and emotions or between expression and representation.<br>

Abstract: Alexis Kagame utilise des expressions qui paraissent contradictoires.
Le temps serait « marqué », « estampillé », « individualisé ». C'est que « dans
la culture traditionnelle bantu, le temps est une entité incolore, indifférente
aussi longtemps qu'un fait concret ne survient pas » (114). En somme, une
trame, un canevas, pour employer des expressions fort courantes dans la
littérature (et donc la culture) occidentale. Par ailleurs, il observe : « Chez
les Bantu il n'est question que du temps de ceci et cela » (114). Pas de Temps
général, par conséquent, qui, comme la pellicule vierge, se déroulerait en
attendant d'être impressionné. D'ailleurs « il n'existe pas chez les Bantu
de substantif théorique pour indiquer le Temps, comme dans les langues de
culture europeo-américaines » (114). Alors qu'est-ce donc que cette « entité
incolore »? Nous nous en tenons au texte de l'ouvrage, sans vouloir ouvrir
le volumineux dossier des observations ethnologiques, relatives aux temps,
de nombreuses ethnies africaines.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Abstract: Quels rapports peuvent se nouer entre travail et liberté, dès lors que le travail n'est plus essentiellement vécu comme la marque sociale de l'aliénation de la liberté dans l'économie? C'est Marx qui élabore pour la première fois et avec beaucoup de rigueur cette question, en formulant la théorie des deux règnes, celui de la nécessité et celui de la liberté dans le cadre de l'utopie communiste. Pour autant, sa position du problème n'est pas sans maintenir toute une série d'ambiguïtés. En nous appuyant sur les analyses contrastées de Simone Weil et d'André Gorz, nous montrons la dépendance de toute pensée de l'émancipation vis-à-vis d'une philosophie de la liberté qui assume (Gorz) ou qui n'assume pas (Weil) une certaine épaisseur irréductible de tout collectif humain, c'est-à-dire une indépassable hétéronomie de la condition humaine. What sort of connections can be formed between work and freedom, since the work is not essentially lived any more as the social mark of the alienation of the freedom in the economy? It is Marx who elaborates for the first time this problem by formulating the theory of both reigns, the reign of the necessity and the reign of the freedom, within the framework of the communist utopia. For all that, his position of the problem is not without maintaining a whole series of ambiguities. By pressing us on the analyses of Simone Weil and André Gorz, we show the dependence of any thought of emancipation towards a philosophy of the freedom which assumes (Gorz) or which does not assume (Weil) a certain inflexible thickness of any human collective.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330145<br>
Date: 9 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Clifford James<br>
Abstract: Maurice Leenhardt's ethnographic work in New Caledonia spanned nearly half a century, from 1902-1948. The first part of this field research is described and analysed, as background to his later anthropological writings. Leenhardt's specific position as a missionary-ethnographer is discussed, its advantages and disadvantages weighed. A liberal missionary perspective is found, in this case, to be conducive to a portrayal of cultural process. Leenhardt's translation methodology and his relations with key informants are detailed. Transcription, the means by which ethnographic texts are constituted by more than a single subject, is speculatively extended to ethnographic practice generally. Field research may be seen as a collective, reciprocal endeavour through which textualised translations are made. This viewpoint calls into question common notions of description, interpretation and authorship in the writing of ethnography.<br>

Abstract: Roger Chartier superbly charts some of the major historiographical breakthroughs of the postwar period and critically explores such issues as narrativity, objectivity, and readership. His chosen authors are Norbert Elias, Hayden White, Philippe Aries, and Louis Marin - to name a few - but this group and their methodologies suggest an identitarian history and historiography that Chartier condemns at the outset. Such an identitarian history, when designated as universal, has costs. The question remains of forging a history, as Thierry put it, of everyone written for everyone.<br>

Abstract: Partant de l'analyse de la situation mémorielle actuelle, cet article diagnostique la question qu'elle fait naître pour la mémoire relative à l'esclavage dans les Antilles françaises, prise dans une frénésie qui renforce l'idée de mémoires soudainement inventées. Des mémoires de l'esclavage de l'ordre de la circulation intergénérationnelle sont-elles présentes? Cette question renvoie au débat anthropologique propre à ces sociétés où la mémoire collective relative à l'esclavage a longtemps été tenue pour être absente. À partir d'une recherche conduite sur un événement ancien qui reconduit le cadre du conflit originel entre maîtres et esclaves, à savoir l'insurrection de 1870 à la Martinique, l'article décrit les processus mémoriels qu'il a générés. Le recueil de témoignages auprès des descendants des insurgés rend compte de la présence de récits familiaux transmis jusqu'à aujourd'hui selon des modalités particulières liées aux conséquences de la répression de l'événement insurrectionnel. L'interprétation qui s'en dégage amène à revoir la question de la mémoire collective à la Martinique. Taking the analysis of the current memory situation as a starting point, this article analyses the question that it provokes about the memory of slavery in the French West Indies, subjected to a frenzy that reinforced the notion of spontaneously invented memories. Is there an inter-generational dissemination of slavery memory? This question refers to the anthropological debate in societies where collective memory about slavery has long been deemed absent. Using research carried out on an historical event that revives the framework of the original master/slave conflict, namely the 1870 insurrection in Martinique, we describe the memory processes this generated. The collection of accounts from descendentes of the rebels shows that family accounts have been transmitted until this day, using specific forms related to the consequences of the repression of the rebellion.

Abstract: Ce texte est une réaction contre la racialisation croissante des phénomènes sociaux qui est opérée aujourd'hui dans la société française en général et dans les sciences sociales en particulier. Une tendance dont l'émergence d'une « question noire » et d'un des principaux corollaires de celle-ci (au moins pour ce qui est des populations des départements d'Outre-mer), l'activation d'une mémoire de l'esclavage des « nègres », sont ici considérées comme un exemple des plus significatifs. Cette tendance se développe au risque que soient occultés ou, pour le moins, travestis les enjeux, les stratégies et les mécanismes proprement sociaux qui sont au fondement des discriminations racistes qu'affrontent effectivement les « Noirs » en France et que soient finalement brisées — sous le poids de la concurrence de victimes de l'histoire exigeant réparation — les solidarités transcommunautaires de diverses sortes qui, seules, peuvent enrayer ces discriminations et les dynamiques les déterminant. Elle a pour un de ses principaux moteurs des stratégies d'élites qui, toutes, consistent à constituer le racialisme en un moyen d'ascension sociale. Des stratégies dans lesquelles et pour lesquelles des groupes d'individus — convenablement dotés en capitaux de différentes sortes (économique, culturel et « racial ») — se révèlent donc particulièrement aptes à capter à leur seul profit les mobilisations identitaires ou mémorielles qu'ils ont souvent contribué à déclencher mais dont d'autres, moins bien dotés, forment la grande masse des fantassins. Concernant les populations des départements d'Outre-mer, les stratégies en question sont portées par des élites nationalistes ou indigénistes en mal de reconnaissance et renvoient à une même logique argumentative qui, sous couvert d'une dénonciation de l'aliénation coloniale (sous les espèces de « l'aveuglement à la couleur » ou de « l'oubli généralisé de l'esclavage »), est opposée à tous ceux qui, désireux de construire une citoyenneté français~<br>

Abstract: This study deals with the popular notions of "popular religion", the "feast" and the "sacred". The following article retraces the logical steps involved in F.-A. Isambert's research which enabled the author to reconstitute the stages involved in the transformation of these popular notions in terms of their social functions into concepts constructed sociologically. This analytical reconstitution is combined with a critical approach which examines both the sociological constructs themselves as well as the ideas inherent in defining social strategies. The article also summarizes the debate concerning this question and presents its own criticisms.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154135<br>

Author(s): Statkiewicz Max<br>
Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Author(s): Wogenstein Sebastian<br>
Abstract: The question how to situate Dea Loher's drama Manhattan Medea in the Medea reception serves as a point of departure for a discussion of imitation, originality, and the act of copying. In their dialogues, the characters Medea, as in Euripides' tragedy a refugee, and Velazquez, a security guard, reflect on originality and imitation. The article explores the theoretical and self-referential aspects evoked by these discussions and links them with a more general inquiry into the dimensions of interpretation in the arts. The question of originality and appropriation is expanded and problematized through focusing on radical social criticism voiced among others by the drag queen Deaf Daisy. In this context the article also examines the potential of performative signification encountered in Medea's deadly bridal gift, especially in light of Marjorie Garber's remark that "[w]hat gets married is a dress." Transgressive in its form too, Manhattan Medea combines tragic elements and those characteristic of comedy.<br>

Abstract: Memory and forgetting are key subjects of current historical and sociological research. Their meaning embraces passive as well as active forms of collective recollection and oblivion, activities of retention as well as of dynamic shifting in the broad field of symbolic representation. Applied to Rezeptionsgeschichte and Wirkungsgeschichte in the perspective of the Classical Tradition, those key terms signify the complex interplay between change and continuity. The materials discussed under this assumption mainly range from theories and practices of memory in Antiquity and the Middle Ages to Renaissance systems of architecture and art, from the early emergence of advanced civilizations to a modern conceptualized history of cultural change. The connecting element is the theoretically defined concept of "cultural memory" not only comprising textuality and literary techniques of memory but also image production and ritual activities in non-literate societies. At the end the question will be asked, whether there are any alternative ways of culture-investigation lying hidden within cultural memory itself.<br>

Publisher: Transaction Periodicals Consortium<br>
Issue: i30222610<br>
Date: 4 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Forsyth Neil<br>
Abstract: Milton's Paradise Lost is an epic poem about the origin of evil, mixing classical and Christian forms and sources. This essay first explores whether "evil" is primarily a classical or Judeo-Christian concept, and shows that it is a product of the religious syncretism of the Hellenistic period. Yet among the poets, we meet this new sense of malignance chiefly in Virgil, especially in such a figure as Allecto. The essay then shows how Milton's language carefully discriminates among these origins, so that the imagery of Hell comes from Virgil, while the conception of evil remains principally Christian, both in the narrative and in philosophical reflection. But in the final section of the essay, we see that the being whose identity is the answer to the poem's initiating epic question ('Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?'), and whose actions drive the poem into motion and inaugurate its story-Satan-, is, like his daughter Sin, a complex and seductive blend of both-and this helps to explain some of the tension we feel in his presence. He is a much more complex answer than those required by the initiating questions in Homer or Virgil, and indeed it takes the whole poem to understand that answer.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i30245669<br>
Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Glasner-Heled Galia<br>
Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Article Title: Links across the Abyss: Language and Logic in International Relations<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i355724<br>
Date: 9 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Zehfuss K. M.<br>
Abstract: Constructivists have distanced themselves from questions of language in order to engage the "positivist" mainstream in dialogue. Yet language has played a central role in one important strand of positivism. Current debates in international relations assume a question about whether language is important. This article asks how or why language is important to the study of IR by exploring two distinct phases of the linguistic turn. The first phase, associated with logical positivism, approaches language as a picture of the logic of reality; the second, at the roots of a range of alternative approaches, approaches language use as analogous to making moves in a game. In constructing a link between two phases of the linguistic turn, the abyss separating "positivists," who aren't concerned with language, and "poststructuralists," who are, is replaced with a spectrum of different approaches to language and logic in international relations. The significance of these differences is illustrated in a variety of theoretical and empirical examples.<br>

Publisher: Editions Ophrys<br>
Issue: i275060<br>
Date: 3 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Young Isabelle<br>
Abstract: L'article fait le point sur la crise de la totalisation en ethnographie et sur les perspectives qui s'offrent actuellement pour la dépasser. Il résume les grandes lignes de l'ethnographie " intégrative " qui s'est constituée dans le prolongement de l'anthropologie sociale et culturelle, autour de l'idée de totalisation monographique. Puis il discute la critique qui en a été faite et les nouvelles formes de rapports entre enquête et écriture qui ont été explorées dans les démarches narratives. Il envisage enfin, sous le terme d'ethnographie " combinatoire ", les pratiques d'enquête qui se sont mises en place dans le cadre de l'interactionnisme puis des développements récents de la sociologie de l'action. Partant de la question de la totalisation des données dans chacune de ces trois formes d'empirie ethnographique, il caractérise les différentes formes d'altérité ainsi constituées dans le cours de l'enquête. /// This article considers the crisis of totalisation in ethnography and the perspectives that are currently available to overstep it. It summarizes the major lines of "integrative ethnography" which has developed as a prolongation of social and cultural anthropology, around the idea of monographical totalisation. The article goes on to discuss the criticism it received and the new types of relation between survey and wiriting that have been explored in the narrative approach. It then imagines ethnographical practice which, by distinguishing between generalisation and totalisation, is put into place in the light of interactionism, then recent developments of action sociology. /// Der Aufsatz berichtet über den heutigen Stand der Totalisierungskrise in der Ethnographie und über die heute bestehende Aussichten, Fortschritte zu verzeichnen.

Article Title: Weber and Freud: Vocation and Self-Acknowledgement<br>
Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275777<br>
Date: 10 1, 1971<br>
Author(s): Weber Tracy B.<br>
Abstract: Most comparisons between Weber and Freud merely identify them as part of larger cultural syndromes. In this paper, I argue that they most resemble each other in the centrality they give to the notion of vocation or adulthood. For both, the man truly possessed of his vocation is the touchstone by which reality is both understood and transformed. They differ, however, in the structure they attribute to vocation. Weber sees it as requiring that humans accept their own historical sociology as constitutive of their selves; Freud asserts that (some) humans can escape from their pasts and only thus become full human beings. /// En générale, les comparaisons entre Freud et Weber se réduisent a l'affirmation qu'ils font tous les deux parti d'une même culture fin-de-siècle bourgeoise. Par contre, je soutiens ici qu'ils se ressemblent le plus dans la centralité qu'ils donnent chacun aux idées de la vocation et de l'adulte. Pour chacun, l'homme de vocation est la source de la comprehension de la réalité et de la transformation de la réalité. Ils diffèrent dans leur sens de la structure de la vocation. Pour Weber, l'homme de la vocation prends sur lui-même son passé et la sociologie de son histoire. Pour Freud, c'est plûtot une question d'echapper à son histoire, quelque chose que seulement certains pevent accomplir.<br>

Author(s): Sinclair T. J.<br>
Abstract: From Aristotle to Roman Jakobson and beyond, metaphor's status as the pre-eminent literary trope has been accepted largely without question. If the characteristic force of metaphor lies in the way it widens the gap between language and event, it is possible that metaphor's 'rule' may be weakened when language and event collide. The article argues that it is in the light of such collisions, dislocations, and displacements rather than in the more measured figurings of the symbolic, that the work of the Vietnam novelist Tim O'Brien can best be read.<br>

Publisher: Religious Research Association<br>
Issue: i284917<br>
Date: 6 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Wulff James E.<br>
Abstract: This paper argues that the question of the relationship between religiosity and mental health has been miscast because both religiosity and mental health have been understood in the discipline from a distinctly modernist perspective. This modernist perspective is characterized by a metaphysic of substances and by empiricism, and it insists that all scientifically interesting relationships must be efficient causal relationships among substances. From this perspective the only legitimate questions revolve around which way the causal arrow points. The paper argues that this framing of the question and the modernist perspective which gives rise to it fail as adequate accounts of either phenomenon and, thus, of their relation. Further, in some fundamental sense the perspective fails to take either religiosity or psychopathology seriously.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i369545<br>
Date: 10 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Danto F. R.<br>
Abstract: Philosophy of history is the Cinderella of contemporary philosophy. Philosophers rarely believe that the issues dealt with by philosophers of history are matters of any great theoretical interest or urgency. In their view philosophy of history rarely goes beyond the question of how results that have already been achieved elsewhere can or should be applied to the domain of historical writing. Moreover, contemporary philosophers of history have done desperately little to dispel the low opinion that their colleagues have of them. In this essay I argue that Arthur Danto is the exception confirming the rule, for Danto's philosophy of representation may help us understand how texts relate to what they are about. The main shortcoming of (twentieth-century) philosophy of language undoubtedly is that it never bothered to investigate the philosophical mysteries of the text. The writing of history is a philosophical goldmine and we must praise Danto for having reminded us of this.<br>

Abstract: N'y aurait-il que les philosophes à s'interroger sur le temps? Les historiens resteraient-ils positivistes au point de bouder toute réflexion sur cette catégorie qui gît pourtant au cœur de leur discipline? "L'ordre du temps," de K. Pomian, qui vient de paraître chez Gallimard, montre combien le temps des historiens a varié et à quels dangers ils s'exposent en n'y prenant pas garde. /// Should time be a philosophical question? In general, French historians seem to have neglected this essential problem concerning reflection on time. Both because of a positivist tradition which seeks the linearity of the event and of a mistrust of the philosophy of history, they have not wanted to come to grips with the question of temporality. And yet the very nature of history comes from this question. K. Pomian's recent book, "L'ordre du temps" (Gallimard) illustrates the richness of the philosophic thinking on the variation of the notion of time and its importance in understanding the various historical schools.<br>

Abstract: En quoi le western, ce genre cinématographique si typiquement américain, peut-il aider les historiens à réfléchir sur leurs propres méthodes? En comparant les œuvres de John Ford et de Michael Cimino, Christian Delage nous invite à revenir sur la question des temporalités et des représentations de la durée. /// The filmmaker reconstructs the past rather than reconstituting it, and thus meets the historian. The analysis of two major works by John Ford and Michael Cimino shows how the cinema historicizes a past event through the indirect agency of the narrative. In the fiction presented to the audience, the filmmaker, like the historian, faces representations inscribed in general history, while simultaneously modifying its meaning. American cinema carries on an almost ontological relation with duration and time; the question of its truthfulness presents the same methodological challenge as that driving contemporary historical research.<br>

Author(s): Conan Jean-Jacques<br>
Abstract: Faut-il vraiment doubler désormais chaque haut lieu de mémoire par un "équipement d'interprétation" et d'accueil où s'opèrerait un "rattrapage de la mémoire par l'histoire"? La question hante sans aucun doute les collectivités locales, soucieuses aussi bien de "devoir de mémoire" que de rentabilité touristique. Elle est toujours actuelle, par exemple à Colombey à propos du général de Gaulle. Elle a été posée avec une intensité particulière à Oradour de 1993 à 1999. En voici la version personnelle d'un chef de projet qui là-bas tenta de gérer l'impossible, avant d'être remercié. En 1993, le conseil général de la Haute-Vienne a décidé la construction d'un équipement culturel d'accueil et d'information destiné à recevoir les visiteurs des ruines du village d'Oradour-sur-Glane martyrisé par la division SS "Das Reich" en juin 1944. Ce "Centre de la mémoire" fut inauguré en 1999 par le président de la République. L'auteur, ancien chef du projet, décrit les difficultés de sa mise en œuvre, car la communauté d'Oradour, détentrice de la mémoire des victimes, s'opposa souvent aux initiatives publiques et, plus largement, à toute vision critique de l'événement dont une meilleure connaissance aurait pu, pourtant, hâter le travail du deuil. /// In 1993, the general council of the Haute-Vienne decided to build a welcome and information cultural center for the visitors to the ruins of Oradour-sur-Glane, martyr zed by the SS division "Das Reich" in June 1944. This "Memory Center" was inaugurated in 1999 by the President of the Republic. The author, the former head of the project, describes the difficulties of its implementation, because the community of Oradour, the holder of the victims' memory, often took issue with the public initiatives and any critical vision of the event even though more knowledge of it could have hastened the period of mourning.<br>

Abstract: Le "devoir de mémoire" a déjà une histoire sociale et le débat entre mémoire et histoire a pris une telle force médiatique et scientifique que l'un et l'autre ne peuvent pas être ignorés à l'école, et d'abord au collège et au lycée. Leur exposé est certes, aujourd'hui, de précieux secours pédagogique et civique. Mais il s'agit aussi de ne pas instrumentaliser l'histoire; de ne pas faire des jeunes de nouveaux "témoins"; de ne sacraliser aucun "devoir de mémoire". Dire la mémoire en classe devrait aider, au contraire, à produire du sens, à privilégier l'intelligence sur le souvenir, à affirmer des vérités encore plus probantes: à mieux connaître et apprendre de l'histoire, par conséquent, pour armer au passage tous les nouveaux citoyens. En France comme dans bien d'autres pays, le débat entre histoire et mémoire traverse aussi l'école, et surtout le collège et le lycée. Il ne s'agit pas de refuser à la mémoire, portée par les témoins, son statut déjà acquis de bon auxiliaire pédagogique. Mais l'enseignement de l'histoire doit produire du sens et rester au service d'une vérité toujours mieux élaborée. C'est à ce prix qu'il conservera sa force de conviction civique. /// In France as in many other countries, the debate between history and memory occurs in school also, especially in high school. There is no question of not giving memory, brought by witnesses, its already acquired status of good pedagogical aid. But teaching history must produce meaning and remain in the service of the truth, which has constantly to be better made. That is the price for its force of civic conviction.<br>

Abstract: How did men seduce in seventeenth-century Spanish society? To answer that question this article interweaves the classic seventeenth-century tale "The Playboy [Deceiver] of Seville" with the love letters written by Spanish men subsequently identified as seducers in breach of promise suits in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Mexico. It defines seduction's central psychological dynamic as men's open declarations of emotional vulnerability to women. By acknowledging their subservience to and dependence upon women from the very outset, men reversed the classic gender hierarchy of Spanish society. This reversal also openly expressed itself in men's inversion of racial, social, generational categories for themselves. The cultural construct of seduction in Spanish society is also shown to be more complex than it appears on the surface, and more susceptible to manipulation by both men and women.<br>

Issue: i370994<br>

Author(s): Winch David P.<br>
Abstract: The question addressed in this article is how people come to know the foundational axioms of their moral systems as true and correct. Drawing on my fieldwork among the Himba of northwestern Namibia, I argue that the most potent form of intellectual conviction is not generated through the external manipulations of ritual, but through a deeply internal experience in which moral knowledge coalesces with a subjectively perceived experience of timeless universality. / Dans cet article, l'auteur cherche à savoir comment les individus en viennent à savoir que les axiomes fondateurs de leur système moral sont véridiques et corrects. À partir de son travail de terrain chez les Himba du nord-ouest de la Namibie, il affirme que la forme la plus puissante de conviction intellectuelle ne naît pas de manipulations externes dans le cadre de rituels, mais d'une expérience profondément intériorisée au cours de laquelle le savoir moral fusionne avec l'expérience subjective d'une universalité intemporelle.<br>

Abstract: Is history a category of reason, or is reason a category of history? These opposing questions have divided the structuralist from the materialist-but neither question is wrong. Analysis of the logic of oppositions challenges feminism, in particular, to find a logic-and a poetics-in which to render its values without historical or theoretical naiveté. I explore the question of the timing of feminism through Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray.<br>

Author(s): McKendrick Karen L.<br>
Abstract: The critical reception of Asher B. Durand's 1855 painting In the Woods sets out some of the preeminent concerns and terms of debate for the genre, and for art in general in the years preceding the Civil War. The painting divided critical opinion. Employing common aesthetic criteria, the opposing writers all took up the question of whether a landscape painting should dwell on factual details. The commentary, however, expressed aesthetic opinions in a vocabulary of labour, materialism, and commodities. Consequently, I consider the relationship between the form of the painting and the partisanship of its reception, how we might read the uneasy and indirect, yet evident rhetorical movement between aesthetic terms and economic ones, and what the implications were for the definition of landscape painting. Arguing that In the Woods offered the material substance of the world as a value by itself, and a mode of viewing that installed significance on the surface, I suggest that the debate was over the larger role of art. Would representation be defined by materialism? Should art, with its lofty status as a transcendent value, sanction by adopting, the mode of vision utilised by the commodity?<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000901<br>
Date: 9 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ferreira M. Jamie<br>
Abstract: Levinas himself raises the question: "why would I feel responsible in the presence of the Face" since "we are separate ontological beings?" This questions the character of our response to the other--both in terms of agency and motivation. While the general reception of Levinas's thought has focused on his description of us as "hostage"--that is, on the moment of assignation (or assignment) by the other--I suggest that Levinas himself also, though not as directly, addresses (as he needs to) the correlative moment, the moment of response. My essay reconstructs Levinas's implicit understanding of the character of our initiative in the light of his concept of Desire. I explore the different dimensions of Desire as appetite and generosity, and I argue that the "transition to moral consciousness" that Levinas wants to "justify" is one from complacent happiness to "non-complacent happiness" and can be illuminated by the notion of "passion seeking its downfall."<br>

Author(s): Ogletree Thomas W.<br>
Abstract: The essay sets forth a historical style in ethics. At the center is the explication of meanings forming the life worlds of representative actors in concrete situations. The sense of life world is sketched in terms of intentionality, intersubjectivity, temporality and embodiment. The essay then delineates the kinds of interpretative activity relevant for understanding life situations: the application of received conventions; suspicion of those conventions as distortions of underlying personal/social dynamics; and a dialectical interplay between a retrieval of one's own traditions, and hospitality to understandings of others differently oriented to the situations in question. The goal is the achievement of common ground which enables us to determine "fitting" action, or at least to keep open the wholeness it promises.<br>

Abstract: One way into the question of the relation of ethics and liturgy is to focus on a critical issue facing liturgy today: its impoverishment and inability to nurture Christian faith and life. Three aspects of this problem are: injustice within the worshipping community, disagreement regarding forms of Christian service to the world, and the breakdown of symbols. Ethics must move beyond the articulation of formal principles and assertions regarding the importance of liturgy for the moral agent if it is to fulfill its task vis-à-vis these problems.<br>

Abstract: Il est question dans cet article du monde des free parties et des teknivals, frange la plus radicale et la plus engagée politiquement qui ait émergé autour de la musique techno en Europe. L'auteur a débuté ses recherches en 1994 en se penchant sur les phénomènes de transe qu'il pouvait y observer. Ces fêtes s'agencent en effet en de véritables dispositifs dont les nombreux inducteurs, spatiotemporels, sensoriels, musicaux, festifs ou encore organisationnels, concourent à obtenir de tels phénomènes. À travers leur énumération et leur description, sont examinées les spécificités propres à ces fêtes particulières, mais aussi les valeurs, les utopies véhiculées par leurs acteurs qui, aujour'hui, ont largement changé de visage pour différentes raisons, parmi lesquelles le fait qu'ils vieillissent.<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Author(s): Do Carmo Silva Carlos Henrique<br>
Abstract: O presente estudo constitui um ensaio crítico de reflexão sobre a questão dos limites da linguagem em Wittgenstein. A perspectiva deste estudo observa, numa primeira parte, o próprio procedimento do método wittgen-steiniano e segue um modelo de discurso plural, a partir de várias perspectivas que, não só permitem desconstruir a aparente unidade da razão, como indagar interiormente do próprio limite da análise wittgensteiniana. Retomando a caracterização da linguagem e do pensamento nos seus traços fundamentais, desde o "Tractatus" até às "Investigações Filosóficas", chama-se a atenção para os pontos de dificuldade, da indefinição e da cons-trutividade do modelo de Wittgenstein. A plena lição do "autómaton" da linguagem face a uma possível diferenciação dos signos e aprofundamento lógico, constitui uma parte desta reflexão que se complementa pela referência aos horizontes de resíduo do não-linguístico, ou até do indizível, numa dupla maneira de estabelecer os limites da linguagem. Enfim, e a título conclusivo, apontam-se, não apenas os contornos do que se entende como uma moral retórica da linguagem em Wittgenstein, mas para perspectivas originais de um reaprofundamento em termos etioló-gicos de diferenciação de escala da lógica e da linguagem, e de recuperação de uma intencionalidade psico-lógico-linguística superando aquela indiferen-ciação do dizer no automático da fala estatuída na "ordinary language". /// La présente étude constitue un essai critique qui réfléchie sur la question des limites du langage dans la philosophie de Wittgenstein.

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse.

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique.

Tout en reconnaissant un certain logocentrisme–un mélange de Logos et de réalité supposée–impliqué dans la solution de ces questions qui nous est proposée par l'auteur, on cherche à repenser le lieu entre le sens et le consensus, la cohérence et la question même de la violence. A cet effet, la derniére section établit une confrontation entre les positions défendues par Ricoeur et l'hypothèse de R.

Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis.

Abstract: Este artigo reflecte sobre o significado critico dos conceitos de tradição e preconceito, noções fundamentias da filosofia hermeneutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer. Visa de forma particular a contestação que o autor faz da moderna redução do sentido da filosofia. Filosofia ou teoria da ciência, eis os termos de uma questão que atravessa o pensamento de Gadamer, desde Verdade e Método, até aos últimos textos. Para o filosofo, na raiz originária do sentido está um modo ôntico de ser, caracterizado pela memória, pelo efeito histórico da tradição e pela necessidade de formação. A razão, que se sabe hoje historica e finita, parte sempre de pressupostos, que marcam a sua basilar inserção na comunidade da palavra já sempre partilhada e nos lembram como é ilusório o sonho iluminista de uma transparência total. /// This article is a reflexion about the critical meaning of the concept of tradition and prejudice in the hermeneutical philosopphy of H.-G. Gadamer. It focuses on Gadamer's protest against the modern reduction of the meaning of philosophy. Philosophy or theory of science are the terms of the question that crosses all of Gadamer's thought, from Wahrheit und Methode until the later works. At the root of meaning is for Gadamer an ontological way of being characterized by memory, the historic effect of tradition and the need of formation. Reason, which we now know as historical and finite, is grounded on presuposed ideas which mark its fundamental insertion in the comunity of the world, already shared, and remind us of how deceptive the iluminist dream of a total transparency actually is.<br>

Author(s): Duque João<br>
Abstract: Objectivo dopresente artigo é estabelecer a relação entre a filosofia hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer e a teologia, a partir do estudo da referênda mútua que existe entre ambas. Analisa, por um lado, a influência da questão hermenêutica, em tor no a Bultmann, à "Teologia da Palavra" e ao próprio Heidegger, sobre a formulção filosofica de Gadamer; por outro, analisa a influencia exercida pela filosofia hermenêutica de Gadamer sobre a discussão teológica posterior, sobretudo ao nível da Teologia Fundamental, ou seja, de uma reflexão sobre os pressupostos hermenêuticos da própria teologia. Chega-se, desta forma, a uma tematização da metafisica, na confluência entre filosofia e teologia. O artigo salienta também a importância das reflexões de Gadamer sobre a arte e o tempo, pelas possibilidades que, para além da hermenêutica restrita, abrem ao estabelecimento de outrospontos de ligação entre a filosofia e a teologia. /// Ojective of the present article is to establish a relation between Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics and theology on the basis of an overlapping thematics. On the one hand, there is the influence of the hermeneutical question, centered around Bultmann's "Theology of the Word" and Heidegger's work, on Gadamer's philosophical discourse. On the other hand, Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics excercised an influence on fundamental theology, particularly in relation to the hermeneutical presuppositions operative in the theological enterprise. Metaphysical thematics can be thus found at the point where philosophy and theology converge. The article seeks, in addition, to bring out the importance of Gadamer's reflexions on art and time as especially useful in establishing other common concerns shared by philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: As religiões podem ser consideradas como sistemas simbólicos mediante os quais os seres humanos ao longo da sua história sempre procuraram encontrar sabedoria em ordem a enfrentar o mal Um olhar pela história das religiões oferece-nos dados que podem ser compreendidos a partir de três tipos ideais de atitude básica em relação ao problema: Ascese, Gnose, Praxis. O Budismo originário, o Maniqueísmo e a religião bí-blico-cristã são exemplificações disso mesmo. Mais do que uma opção pela exclusão, os membros da nossa cultura ocidental iluminada demonstram uma preferência pela atitude práxica. É a partir dela que nos cabe recuperar os valores das outras. Isso é também o que em muitos significa a presença de uma certa nostalgia pela "espiritualidade oriental". Ou ainda, como modesta gnose, a "teodiceia" (porquê tanto mal?): tão pouco prometedora enquanto resposta (teórica), como inevitável enquanto pergunta. /// Religions can be viewed as symbolic systems with which human beings have throughout history sought the wisdom which enables them to face evil. A survey through the history of religions exhibits features which may be brought to three ideal types of basic attitudes: the ascetic, the gnostic and the 'praxical'. Original Buddhism, Manichaeism and the biblical-Christian Religion exemplify them. Men and women of our occidental, enlightened culture need not to take an exclusive option thereabout. They show a preference for the praxical trend, even though at the same time they also retrieve some of the values of the other ones. Signs of this can be seen in the interest of many for 'oriental spirituality' as well as in that sort of modest gnosis which is "theodicee "(Why so much evil?): always unpromising as a theoretical answer and unavoidable as a question. /// Las religiones pueden ser consideradas como sistemas simbólicos con los que los seres humanos hemos buscado en nuestra historia una sabiduría para afrontar el mal.

Abstract: This article presents a variety of philosophical answers to the age old question: unde malum - where does evil come from? Starting with the metaphysical responses of Augustine, Hegel and Kant, it proceeds to examine some more recent approaches - Lyotard, Kristeva and Zizek - in terms of the 'postmodern sublime'. He concludes by proposing a 'hermeneutic' response to the problem, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, which seeks to address the question in terms of narrative understanding and practical action. /// O presente artigo apresenta uma série de respostas filosóficas à imemorial questão: unde malum - qual a origem do mal? Partindo das respostas metafísicas de Santo Agostinho, Hegel e Kant, o autor examina depois algumas das abordagens mais recentes ao problema - Lyotard, Kristeva e Zizek - em termos do 'sublime pós-moderno', O artigo conclui com uma proposta 'hermenêutica 'para o problema, proposta essa inspirada no pensamento de Paul Ricoeur e cujo objectivo é elucidar a questão do mal em termos de uma compreensão narrativa e de acção prática.<br>

Abstract: O enigma do mal, o escândalo do mal em todas as suasformas, não cessa de inquietar a consciência humana, revelando-se hoje como obstáculo principal à crença em Deus e assunindo proporções tais que as teodiceias do passado, por vezes heróicas, deixaram mesmo de ser possíveis. O presente artigo não as pretende justiflcar, nem sequer desculpar Deus. O seu ponto de partida está antes na consciência de que não se pode separar o mal e os maus, a maldade e o sofrimento, o qual é muitas vezes o reverso do crime. Para o autor, a síntese e o nó górdio da questão do mal está na infelicidade (malheurj no sentido que lhe dá Simone Weil (ódio, opróbrio e sofrimento indissoluvelmente ligados) e a figura do Servo Sofredor. O mal puro, o "mal radical", constitui um desafio à metafísica, desafio este que ela deve ter a coragem de aliviar, de questionar sem cessar, mesmo sabendo que não há solução para o problema do mal, pois que quanto mais lidamos com ele tanto mais se nos obscurece e transforma em mistério. /// The riddle of evil, the scandal of evil in all its forms, does not stop disturbing the human conscience, revealing itself today as the main obstacle to the belief in God and assuming such proportions that even the theodicies of the past, sometimes heroic, stopped being possible. This article does not wish to justify them nor even excuse God. Its starting point is rather in the conscience that evil and the evil ones, wickedness and suffering cannot be separated, which is many times the reverse of crime. According to the author, the synthesis and the Gordian knot concerning evil is in the unhappiness (malheur) according to Simone Weil's sense (hate, opprobrium and suffering indissolubly connected) and the Suffering Servant figure. Pure evil, or "radical evil", is a challenge to metaphysics, challenge that metaphysics should have the courage to mitigate, question unceasingly, even knowing that there is not a solution for the problem of evil as the more we deal with it, the more~<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies. To the attacks on the atheist's side correspond, according to the theologian's side, either some resentement related to God or their excuse by means of calling in question God's omnipotence.

Abstract: Por ocasião do cinquentenário da morte de Freud, ocorrida em 1989, multiplicaram-se as homenagens e as publicaçães que acentuaram não só os aspectos clínicos da sua obra científica, mas também o valor e a significação cultural da Psicanálise. O mesmo haveria de ocorrer uma década mais tarde por ocasião do centenário da publicação de A Interpretação dos Sonhos, obra inaugural da técnica psicanalítica e uma das principais marcas na história da psicologia contemporânea. Com opresente artigo, o autor pretende demonstrar até que ponto a Psicanálise é ainda hoje uma teoria e uma prática tão viva como conflitiva, mostrando, além disso, até que ponto ela assumiu, tal como Freud previra, um carácter de autêntica revolução científica e epistemológica, similar à copernicana ou a darwiniana nos seus respectivos momentos historicos. Neste sentido, para la de analisar diversas posturas culturais em relação à Psicanálise, as quais nos interrogam acerca da sua presumível universalidade, o artigo mostra também até que ponto a descoberta do Inconsciente constitui profundo abalo no estatuto do sujeito humano. /// At the time the fiftieth anniversary of Freud's death occurred, which happened in 1989, many celebrations and publications took place, many of which highlighting not only the clinical aspects of Freud's work, but also the cultural value and meaning of Psychoanalysis. Something similar occurred ten years later on the occasion of the centenary of the publication of the The Interpretation of Dreams, work of fundamental importance for the understanding of the psychoanalytic method and one of the main moments in the history of modern psychology With the present article, the author aims at demonstrating to what extent Psychoanalysis is still a theory and a practice as lively as it is conflictive, showing, among other things how it came to assume, as Freud himself had predicted, a character of an authentic scientific and epistemological revolution, in many ways similar to the Copern~<br>

Abstract: This paper takes up Richard Kearney's work The God Who May Be, specifically in the context of postmodern debates concerning epistemological claims regarding the other. Kearney's hermeneutics of religion attempts to forge a middle path between ontotheological philosophies of religion and various quasi-religious manifestations of postmodernism; however, my main concern is to address certain points of disagreement between Kearney and proponents of a deconstructive "religion without religion" principally Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo. The main issue at stake is just how other God is, which is itself a specific case of a broader question concerning otherness per se. Caputo et al. claim that religious assertions about God are fundamentally undecidable, which means that they are "infinitely translatable" and "substitutable," that we can never tell what is a translation of what, but the ultimate point is that it "does not matter" The undecidable nature of religious claims includes the very claim that religion is a discourse about God, which is why deconstructive religion without religion is a messianic hope for "the impossible" devoid of any content. Kearney objects that such radical undecidability leaves us lost in the desert ofkhora with no way to distinguish, even imperfectly and provisionally, between God and Satan, good and evil, the widow and the terrorist. In this paper I claim that Kearney succeeds in finding this via tertia between the Scylla of dogmatism and the Charybdis of complete indeterminacy by thinking God in two important ways: as persona-prosopon (which avoids confusing God with khora or monstrosity) and as posse (which keeps us from dogmatism). /// O presente artigo toma em particular consideração a obra de Richard Kearney The God Who May Be, especificamente no contexto dos debates pós-modernos acerca do estatuto epistemológico da alteridade.

Is it true that Richard Kearney's philosophy of religion, like Arnold's reflections on the Bible, are "mystic maybe's," mere flirtations with possibility? In order to answer this question I seek to understand Kearney's expression "the God who may be" and to see if it fits into a non-metaphysical philosophy of religion. The expression is clarified by way of comparisons with Wolfhart Pannenberg's eschatological understanding of God and Eberhard Jungel's theology of possibility. One weak point in Kearney's philosophy of religion, it is argued, is its avoidance of theology in the name of the philosophy of religion. A sound philosophy of religion needs to engage with theology. /// "Mystic Maybe's" (Possibilidades místicas): Este titulo deriva das palavras de Augustine Birrill acerca da morte de Mathew Arnold. O autor do artigo pergunta até que ponto a filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney não será, tal como as reflexões de Arnold acerca da Bíblia, um mew "místico talvez", um simples namoro com a possibilidaãe. Em ordem a responder à questão, o autor procura compreender o sentido da expressão de Richard Kearney acerca do "Deus que pode ser" de modo a avaliar até que ponto a expressão se adequa a uma filosofia não-metafísica da religião. O artigo clarifica a expressão de Kearney mediante uma comparação quer com a compreensão escatológica de Deus de Wolfhart Pannenberg quer com a teologia da possibilidade de Eberhard Jüngel. Mostra-se, desta forma, que um dospontos maisfracos na filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney consiste na sua tentativa de escapar à teologia em nome da filosofia da religião. Com efeito, argumenta o autor do artigo, uma autêntica filosofia da religião não pode deixar de estar num diálogo eficaz com a teologia.<br>

Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Abstract: De part et d'autre de l'Atlantique, l'œuvre de Michel Foucault a été reçue de manière très différente par les anthropologues. Si l'anthropologie américaine a accueilli avec enthousiasme les réflexions du philosophe sur les rapports entre pouvoir et savoir, sur sa conceptualisations du biopolitique, les anthropologues français se sont montrés plus réticents et ont manifesté longtemps une certaine méfiance à l'égard de ce penseur. Chez Foucault luimême, on ne trouve que de rares références à l'anthropologie, et son point de vue sur l'anthropologie structurale est extrêmement critique. Cet article est centré sur la question du pouvoir, car c'est là que l'influence foucaldienne sur la nouvelle anthropologie est particulièrement manifeste, et il s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une interrogation plus large sur les rapports entre philosophie et anthropologie. /// On both sides of the Atlantic, anthropologists have received Michel Foucault's work quite differently. Whereas American anthropology has enthusiastically accepted the philosopher's thoughts about the relations between power and knowledge, and his conceptualization of "biopolitics", French anthropologists have, for a long time now, been more reluctant, even wary of this thinker. Foucault's work contains very few references to anthropology, and his point of view about structural anthropology was extremely critical. This article, which focuses on the question of power, where Foucault's influence on new trends in anthropology is especially evident, is part of a broader inquiry into the relations between philosophy and anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Nées en Grande-Bretagne dans les années 1960-1970, les cultural studies ont connu une diffusion planétaire à laquelle la France fait exception. Cet article tente d'en restituer les "voyages", par emprunt aux sciences sociales continentales, traversées Est/Ouest puis Ouest/Est de l'Atlantique. Il invite à ne ramener la diffusion des théories et paradigmes ni à la force intrinsèque des idées justes ni à des effets de mode, mais à prêter attention à l'institutionnalisation des disciplines et mondes académiques nationaux. Il questionne le "provincialisme" intellectuel français, tantôt authentique arriération, tantôt dénonciation commode du refus des modes et radicalismes superficiels. /// Born in Great Britain in 1960-1970, cultural studies have spread over the planet, apart from France. The journey made by the social sciences on the continent -from east to west and then from west to east across the Atlantic-is described. The diffusion of theories and paradigms should be reduced neither to the intrinsic force of the "right" ideas nor to "fashion". Instead, we should pay attention to the institutionalization of disciplines and to national academias. French intellectual "provincialism" is brought under question, sometimes as evidence of backwardness, sometimes as an easy way to criticize, even refuse, superficial, fashionable ideas and radicalisms.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar conta de alguns dos aspectos mais salientes da questão relativa à pertinência da Filosofia (especialmente na qualidade de Filosofia da Ciência) para a prática científica dos cientistas. Nesse sentido, a autora recorre sobretudo a exemplos vigentes nos finais do século xx, dando especial relevância a manifestações de "impaciência" por parte de alguns investigadores em relação a algumas críticas epistemológicas e éticas dos filósofos, sobretudo no que se refere à famosa controvérsia da "guerra das ciências" e a toda uma ofensiva cultural relativa a uma terceira cultura que apresenta os cientistas como sendo os novos humanistas e em que os "filósofos empíricos" estariam a perder peso. Como resposta, a autora propõe que, embora possam ser dispensáveis no laboratório, aos filósofos deve ser reconhecida a capacidade de disponibilizar às ciências uma linguagem que seja capaz de facilitar o diálogo cultural alargado, uma linguagem, portanto, de que as próprias ciências não se poderão dispensar se realmente quiserem sobreviver no âmbito da cultura do século XXI. /// The present article intends to give an account of some of the more relevant aspects pertaining to the question about the importance of Philosophy, and in particular Philosophy of Science, for the scientific work of scientists. The author of the article gives special attention to examples taken from the scientific landscape at the end of the xx Century, whereby special consideration is given to the impatience shown by some scientists in relation to some epistemological and ethical criticisms coming from the side of Philosophy. Particular attention is given to the famous "war of sciences" and the cultural offensive related to the introduction of a third culture in which the scientists are presented as the new humanists and in which even the "empirical philosophers" were losing weight. In that sense, the author suggests that, even though they might be of not much use in the laboratory,~<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo tem por objectivo fazer uma reflexão sobre o motto, o prólogo e a introdução a O conceito de Angústia (1844) de Søren Kierkegaard. Longe de serem meros preâmbulos, estes textos constituent importantes chaves de leitura para a obra que encabeçam. Na verdade, a distinção socrática entre o que se sabe e o que não se sabe do motto de O conceito de angústia transforma-se no argumento propriamente dito da obra. A partir desta distinção, Kierkegaard desenvolve a sua crítica contra a confusão moderna das ciências, ao mesmo tempo que propõe uma nova divisão em ordem a poder situar legitimamente a questão do pecado. Em vez de conceber o pecado de maneira especulativa, a psicologia da angústia é apresentada como a única disciplina em que propriamente se pode tratar o problema do pecado e, ao mesmo tempo, ser consciente da sua incompreensibilidade. /// The objective of this article is to think about the motto, preface and introduction to Kierkegaard's The Concept of Anxiety (1844). Far from being mere preambles, these texts constitute the reading key for the book they lead. As a matter of fact, the Socratic distinction between what we understand and what we do not understand from The concept of Anxiety's motto becomes the philosophical argument of the work. From this distinction, Kierkegaard carries out a critique against the modern confusion of sciences and at the same time proposes a new arrangement in which to place legitimately the problem of sin. Instead of conceiving sin in a speculative way, the psychology of anxiety shows itself to be the only discipline able to deal properly with the question of sin and to be conscious of its mysterious dimension.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the application of both cognitive and symbolic/interpretive approaches to the analysis of specific cultural domains, in particular to the analysis of ritual. The data sources, referring to a most significant ritual in a rural Makassar community, are subdivided into three categories, namely various verbal statements, an indigenous written text describing form and contents of the ritual, and information resulting from participant observation during its actual performance. The argumentation shifts from a formal analysis of the ritual schema to a discussion of the question to what extent verbal statements as well as the written text have to be conceived of as indigenous interpretations of the local culture, which in turn are interpreted by the ethnographer. It is suggested that both cognitive and symbolic/interpretive approaches should complementary be referred to for a fruitful analysis of at least some domains of cultural knowledge.<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: L'auteur tente dans ce texte d'éclaircir certains aspects de l'imaginaire en relation avec l'Etat, la politique, mais aussi avec la violence et le mal, dans un contexte où la dialectique de l'identité et de l'altérité reste l'une des structures de l'imaginaire. L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: À partir de la scène de mise en patrimoine d'une machine sidérurgique, un haut fourneau de « l'ancienne » Lorraine industrielle, cet article propose une analyse des conditions d'émergence et de stabilisation d'une catégorie patrimoniale récente, le patrimoine industriel, autrement dit du traitement en monument des restes de la seconde industrialisation. La patrimonialisation de tels restes est tout entière déterminée par l'évaluation de leur « comportement » aux différentes étapes de la « chaîne patrimoniale » -connaissance/conservation/valorisation -qui instruit le monument historique.Pour autant ce processus contribue en retour à la mise en question de ce mode de traitement et à l'invention de nouvelles stratégies culturelles. A blast furnace in « formerly » industrialized Lorraine is being presented as a monument belonging to France's national heritage. The conditions are analyzed for the emergence and stabilization of a recent category for classifying what remains from the second wave of industrialization as part of this heritage. This process is fully determined by assessing the object's « behavior » during various stages (knowledge, conservation, treasuring) in the « patrimonial chain » leading to its classification as a historical monument. In feedback, this process leads us to raise questions about handling such sites in this way and inventing cultural strategies.<br>

Abstract: La fiction est en général considérée comme une notion univoque. Or, le terme renvoie selon les contextes à des faits très différents, voire incompatibles : illusion cognitive, leurre, postulat d'indétermination ontologique, expérience de pensée. La tendance actuelle qui consiste à interpréter les textes ethnographiques ou historiographiques comme relevant du régime fictionnel n'est pas faite pour clarifier la situation. L'hypothèse défendue ici est celle d'une spécificité irréductible de la fiction artistique fondée sur une détermination qui n'est pas d'ordre sémantique mais pragmatique : cristallisation culturelle d'une compétence mentale (la simulation) et interactionnelle (la feintise ludique) particulière, la fiction artistique se distingue à la fois des autres types de fiction (qui relèvent d'une définition sémantique) et des récits véridictionnels (pour lesquels la question de la référentialité est la pierre de touche). Fiction is usually considered to be an unequivocal concept. However this term refers to quite different, even incompatible, facts depending on the context: illusions, artifices, the postulate of ontologica! indétermination, and thought experiments. The current tendency of interpreting anthropological or historical texts as fiction does not clarify the situation. The hypothesis is defended that « artistic fiction » has an irreducible specificity, which is determined pragmatically instead of semantically : the cultural crystallization of a mental (simulation) and an interactional (pretending to play) competence. This sort of fiction thus stands apart from other types (which answer to a semantic definition) and from veridical narratives (where the question of referentiality is the touchstone).<br>

Abstract: À partir d'un petit corpus de controverses advenues récemment en France à propos de fictions littéraires ou cinématographiques, mettant l'accent sur les fortes restrictions encadrant actuellement la censure, cet article — inscrit dans la perspective d'une sociologie des valeurs dont sont tout d'abord explicitées les règles énonciatives — se propose : premièrement, de comprendre les principes qui poussent les acteurs à limiter l'espace imparti à la fiction ; deuxièmement, d'examiner la façon dont la narratologie a traité cette question des limites, les principes qui s'en dégagent et les instruments qui méritent d'être retenus ; troisièmement, de réfléchir aux raisons pour lesquelles il peut être nécessaire de limiter soit axiologiquement, soit ontologiquement, la fiction; et quatrièmement, d'expliquer pourquoi les chercheurs ont intérêt à en élargir les limites, de manière à éviter plusieurs types de réductions - logiciste, esthète, herméneutique, scientiste. L'article se termine par une tentative de solution aux controverses précitées, en forme d'avis d'expert outillé par cette analyse des limites de la fiction. Using a small corpus of recent controversies in France about fiction in literature or the cinema that have emphasized the tight restrictions now on censorship, this approach in terms of a sociology of values starts by examining the rules governing speech acts about this topic. First of all, how to understand the principles that lead to limiting the room allowed for fiction ? Secondly, how has narratology dealt with this question of limits ? What principles can be identified, and what instruments are worth using? Thirdly, what reasons might make it necessary to limit fiction either axiologically or ontologically ? Finally, the attempt is made to explain why researchers have an interest in broadening these limits so as to avoid several types (logical, aesthetic, hermeneutic, scientific) of « reduction ». The attempt is made to provide a solution to the aforeme~<br>

Abstract: Si certaines formes-sonate ou certains Andante de Mozart et Beethoven ont la réputation d'être « dramatiques » et de porter une expression fondée sur l'opposition entre tension et détente, est-il possible d'y détecter des règles narratives ? C'est la question à laquelle l'article tente de répondre, en se servant du modèle taxinomique proposé par A. J. Greimas. L'articulation des signifiés à l'intérieur d'un micro-univers sémantique est décrite au travers de la représentation de certains types de passion et de caractères musicaux (topiques, topoï, affects, etc.) détectés dans les œuvres de Mozart par Jozsef Ujfalussy. L'analyse de « la forme du contenu » , c'est-à-dire de la structure des signifiés dans un mouvement de symphonie de Mozart (le premier mouvement de la Symphonie en ut majeur, KV 338) ou de sonate de Beethoven (le deuxième mouvement de la Sonate op. 2 n°3) à l'aide du vocabulaire expressif codifié de l'époque, permet de démontrer la présence quasi « littérale » des rapports de contradiction, contrariété et de présupposition décrits par le fameux « carré sémiotique » de Greimas. On y découvre l'existence symbolique, dans ces mouvements d'œuvres instrumentales, des deux grandes classes de récit de la Sémantique structurale de Greimas, en fonction du maintien ou du refus de la situation de départ. If some sonata forms or some Andantes by Mozart or Beethoven can be described as « dramatic » , and cany an expression based on tension and relaxation, is it possible to detect in them narrative rules ? This is the question which the present article tries to answer, on the basis of the taxinomic model proposed by A. J. Greimas. The articulation of signified within a semantic micro-universe is described through the representation of types of passion and of musical characters detected in Mozart's works by Jozsef Ujfalussy. The analysis of the « content forms » , i.e. of the structure of signified in a Symphony movement by Mozart (KV 338, first movement) or in a sona~<br>

Abstract: In this paper we defend the notion of narrative identity against Galen Strawson's recent critique. With reference to Elyn Saks's memoir of her schizophrenia, we question the coherence ofStrawsons conception of the Episodic self and show why the capacity for narrative integration is important for a flourishing life. We aho argue that Scú< s's case and reflections on the therapeutic role of u illness nanatives }> put pressure on narrative theories that specify unduly restncúve constraints on self-constituting narratives, and chrify the need to distinguish identity from autonomy.<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i40027043<br>
Date: 1 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): DUBOST JEAN-PIERRE<br>
Abstract: Dans son Histoire du structuralisme François Dosse se propose de retracer la genèse, l'évolution et finalement le déclin de la pensée structuraliste des années 50 aux années 80. Ce compte-rendu critique met l'accent sur les questions de méthode et prend en compte l'ambition exprimée par François Dosse de ne pas céder aux tentations d'un „ retour à une écriture ancienne au nom du déclin de la pensée".L'objet de la critique est d'abord de se demander si la description que l'auteur nous propose de trente années de débats intellectuels français ne masque pas la complexité des questions qu'il traite par le choix d'une méthode historique qui privilégie l'événementiel et s'appuie sur une démarche globalisante, en accord avec les choix méthodologiques affichés par l'auteur dans son livre intitulé L'histoire en miettes (1987). L'accent est aussi mis sur les lacunes et sur le silence fait sur un certain nombre d'auteurs. Sans remettre vraiment en cause l'utilité de l'ouvrage et tout en reconnaissant l'ampleur du balayage, la critique porte sur un certain nombre d'éclairages qui démentent l'apparence d'objectivité du tableau général et l'illusion totalisante qu'elle implique. Elle met donc en question la capacité de la méthode choisie à tirer toutes les conclusions de son enquête et en fin de compte à faire contrepoids, serait-ce au nom de l'idéal d'un „ humanisme historique", au retour de cette „ écriture ancienne" que l'auteur se proposait d'éviter.<br>

Author(s): Caraglio Martine<br>
Abstract: Le sujet est la construction identitaire des lesbiennes qui se perçoivent elles-mêmes comme masculines et qui sont ainsi perçues par leur entourage: par les lesbiennes aussi bien que par les autres personnes. Le "masculin" est envisagé comme une création dans et par la hiérarchie de genre.L'au teure a mené pendant un an une enquête dans une discothèque; 19 histoires de vie apportent leur témoignage. Au terme de ses recherches, la masculinité en question apparaît: 1) comme une manière supportable d'être une femme pour celles qui ne sereconnaissent pas dans le stéréotype féminin; 2) comme un "paysage", c'est-àdire comme quelque chose dontlalesbienne trouve les traits dans le système de genres de la société et dont elle s'empare, faute de mieux ou d'autre chose, pour manifester son refus de la position genrée à quoi la société l'assigne. This article is about the construction of identity among lesbians who perceive themselves and are perceived as "masculine" by others, including other lesbians. The "masculine" is seen by the author as a construction of the gender hierarchy. The author has conducted interviews for a year in a bar and has collected 19 life-stories.Her findings show that the masculinity attributed to lesbians is: 1) a way of making tolerable the fact of being a woman for those women who do not accept the feminine stereotypes; 2) a landscape: an environment made up by lesbians with elements they find in society's gender system, for lack of alternative models, and which they use to express their refusal of the gendered position society wants to assign them.<br>

Abstract: Nous nous proposons ici de réfléchir à la question suivante : Comment expliquer le fait que les fondateurs du « programme fort », Barry Bames et David Bloor, insistent depuis quelques années pour dire qu'ils n'ont jamais nié l'influence de la « réalité » sur la formation des connaissances scientifiques et qu'en fait ils ont été mal compris de leurs lecteurs ? Alors que Bloor tente d'expliquer les malentendus en les situant complètement du côté du récepteur, en invoquant une loi psychologique dite de « conventionalisation » proposée par Frederic Charles Bartlett, nous voulons esquisser ici une explication complémentaire qui se situe du côté de l'émetteur et prend au sérieux la structure argumentaire des textes. We propose in this paper to answer the following question : How can we explain the fact that the founders of the « Strong Program », Barry Bames and David Bloor, insisted, over the last couple of years, to say that they have never denied the role played by « reality » in the construction of scientific knowledge, and thus have been misunderstood by their readers ? Whereas Bloor explains these misunderstandings by invoking a psychological law of « conventionalization » due to Frederic Charles Bartlett, thus locating the source of the problem on the receiver's (reader's) side, we suggest here a complementary explanation taking into account the argumentative structure of the text itself, hence situating the origin of the confusion on the writer's side.<br>

Abstract: Cet article traite du rapport de l'engagement et de la connaissance sociologique, en prenant pour terrain la problématique des rapports sociaux de sexe et le féminisme. Plus exactement, c'est la question de l'utopie et de sa fonction heuristique et cognitive éventuelle pour la recherche qui fait l'objet de l'étude. Après avoir rappelé et présenté certains des travaux les plus importants sur la question, il est procédé à une tentative d'élucidation des vertus cognitives de l'utopie féministe matérialiste pour les recherches sur le genre, la différence des sexes et la domination masculine. La conclusion revient sur les implications épistémologiques et méthodologiques de cette étude. This article is devoted to the study of the relationship between engagement and soaological knowledge, in the field of research relevant to gender and feminism. More exactly, the question concerns the heuristic and cognitive functions of utopia. Firstly, the author introduces some of the most significant works on the subject. Then, he tries to clarify the cognitive virtues of the feminist utopia for a better understanding of gender, sex difference and male domination. The conclusion reconsiders the epistemological and methodological implications of the study.<br>

Abstract: Three different concepts of the subject of sociology considera to be dominant in sociological thinking are discussed: the ,socia' as an external, as an internal, and as a serial structure. Comparing these concepts the notion of social structures seems to be dissolving: from a desubstantialization and desubjectivation to a destructuralization and detotalization of the ,social'. This raises the question of the end of sociology.<br>

Author(s): Olsen Ole Johnny<br>
Abstract: The thesis that the German dual system of vocational training as well as skilled labour in general are threatened by erosion is challenged in this article by theoretical arguments and empirical evidence from Norwegian studies. The question is discussed whether the 'erosion thesis' exaggerates the discontinuity of industrial organization principles, thus prematurely devaluating the productive potentials of skilled workers. The author points out that the presumption of an erosion process is based on a restricted concept of 'Beruf' (vocation) and of work organization. Rather than seeing 'process orientation' as an organizational principle that contradicts the concept of 'Beruf', the author argues that it could supplement professional responsibilities, thus extending and renewing the concept. He wonders whether the 'erosion thesis' sufficiently considers the criticism of the neo-classical view of economic behaviour, which was brought forward during the eighties. According to this criticism, the socialization and integration of skilled workers into a professional community can be seen as the well-working institutionalization of a 'practical professionalism' which also includes innovative and future-oriented capacities. Finally, a research perspective is sketched out regarding the future of vocational training and skilled labour.<br>

Abstract: L'éthique de la situation (Situationsethik) est une tendance diffuse, qui s'infiltre dans les systèmes éthiques les plus divers, plutôt qu'une doctrine aux arêtes bien nettes. Il faut cependant qu'on détermine son idée et il semble que ses positions extrêmes se prêtent le mieux à une clarification de son contenu. Elle s'oppose à toute éthique normative abstraite et universelle. Par contraste apparaissent certaines lignes maîtresses, au moins négatives. Les systèmes principalement visés sont le rationalisme, qu'il soit formel ou à contenu matériel, l'éthique sociologique positiviste (Science des mœurs de Durkheim, Lévy-Bruhl...) et toute éthique de l'essence. L'abstraction et l'universalité, l'immutabilité et l'extrinsécisme des normes morales sont les caractères mis en question. Nous nous attachons à montrer que l'éthique de l'essence, telle que la conçoit la tradition chrétienne, ne comporte pas nécessairement les caractères incriminés au sens péjoratif ou la „Situationsethik” les entend. Nous croyons même qu'une éthique de l'essence de par son statut même - certaines formes historiques peuvent être des déviations - tient compte de la situation concrète et historique. Elle le fait de deux manières bien différentes, d'abord en ce qu'elle intègre dans ses impératifs universels les situations les plus diverses, et en second lieu en ce qu'elle pose comme principe obligatoire et universel que chacun doit se laisser conduire par certains impératifs moraux, que lui seul peut voir, du fait qu'ils tiennent à sa situation unique, non seulement de fait mais en principe. En effet, une éthique de l'essence transpose en impératifs moraux aussi bien ce qui appartient à la structure essentielle de l'homme (impératifs absolument universels), que ce qui relève de la contingence, telles les circonstances extérieures et intérieures, qui sont susceptible de se répéter, si pas de fait au moins de droit (impératifs relativementuniversels).

Abstract: Mise radicalement en question par l'accusation de l'épître aux Corinthiens : „La sagesse du monde est folie devant Dieu.” (I Cor. 3,19), la raison humaine doit chercher une méthode, qui lui permettra de parvenir à une conscience de soi, capable d'assumer cette accusation. Cette méthode ne peut être que la réflexion, à laquelle les protagonistes de la phénoménologie, aussi bien que ceux de l'analyse reflexive, font appel. Thévenaz entamera une étude approfondie et critique de ces deux méthodes pour en garder ce qui lui semble valable. Ce faisant il parviendra à une position intermédiaire. Husserl, en épistémologue, ignorant toute conscience de soi, même implicite, reconnaît l'inténtionnalité comme structure unique de la raison humaine. Aussi, pour découvrir et expliciter le sujet concret et intentionnellement lié au monde, il ne lui reste que la solution de projeter cette liaison dans le champ transcendantal, qui se déploie sous les yeux d'un spectateur impartial. Ainsi surgit une nouvelle facticité qui reste nécessairement irréfléchie. Thévenaz accepte volontiers les avantages de cette méthode. Non seulement elle permet de dépasser l'opposition idéalisme-réalisme, mais en plus elle échappe au formalisme kantien, en nous livrant le concret comme tel, le vécu, l'être comme rencontre. Cependant, en insistant exclusivement sur l'intentionnalité, elle met en question cette même intentionnalité. Le sujet concret, doublure du moi transcendantal et intentionnel, redevient ce qu'il était avant la réduction, un oeil sans intériorité braqué sur un nouveau spectacle, le champ transcendantal. Le sujet concret n'y apporte aucun apport constitutif. Le concret s'échappe à nouveau et la naïveté de la „natürliche Einstellung” n'est pas vaincue, mais consacrée. Sartre, quoiqu'il admette une conscience (de) soi, résultant d'un acte de néantisation radicale, se heurte à la même difficulté. Le sujet concret échappe à la réflexion à cause du dédoublement inéluctable inhérent à cette réfle~<br>

Abstract: La psychanalyse freudienne est de bout en bout interprétation ; Freud établit des règles pour l'interprétation, il donne une clé herméneutique, et ébranle et met en mouvement les interprétations existantes que l'homme donne de soi-même et du monde. D'autre part il est remarquable que l'oeuvre de Freud est inconnue et méconnue dans la littérature herméneutique. P. Ricoeur est le premier qui ait compris qu'on ne peut pas se passer de Freud comme interlocuteur lors de la discussion sur l'herméneutique. Freud fonctionne, selon Ricoeur, comme démystificateur. Il démasque les illusions. Une seconde lecture de Freud est la remise en question des intentions réductrices. Dans son essai sur Freud la réflexion, l'interprétation comprise comme réduction de l'illusion, et l'interprétation entendue comme restauration du sens constituent une unité dialectique. Mais schatten. Of hij echter van de echte wijsgerige intentie veel begrepen heeft kan men betwijfelen. Ricoeur ne parle jamais de l'acte psychanalytique ou du dialogue psychanalytique en tant que tel. C'est pour cette raison que la vraie portée de la découverte freudienne se perd probablement. Dans l'acte psychanalytique il se révèle que l'homme est situé dans un langage et dans un discours transindividuel. Un discours qui est en même temps présentation, objectivation, identification, apologie, provocation, frustration et aliénation. Le langage, selon Lacan, a une primauté sur le sujet parlant et le discours transindividuel est irréductible. La primauté du langage et du discours, considérée comme irréductible peut changer et éclairer d'une façon toute nouvelle les questions fondamentales de l'herméneutique actuelle.<br>

Abstract: Pour que la raison humaine puisse vraiment parvenir à une authentique conscience de soi, elle a besoin d'un autre que la raison. C'est la vie du chrétien, qui se déroule à côté des impératifs de la raison, et surtout l'accusation de l'épître aux Corinthiens „La sagesse du monde est folie devant Dieu” (I Cor. 3, 19) , qui viennent briser le monologue perpétuel de la raison avec soi-même et la libérer ainsi de son ignorance de soi. En effet cette accusation, qui ne s'impose pas avec des arguments contraignants, met la raison globalement en question sans en exclure aucun procédé. Ainsi la raison n'a plus d'armes en main pour se défendre et se trouve à découvert. Tout d'un coup elle entrevoit que son exercice se fondait jusque là sur des évidences non établies. Des questions nouvelles se posent : quelle est la signification de la rationalité de la raison ? quel est le sens du sens ? En méditant sur ces questions, la raison se rend compte qu'elle ne peut même pas comprendre leur sens. Elle se trouve devant un autre langage qu'elle ne peut pas assimiler. Son egocentrisme fondamental est brisé. La raison se voit d'un oeil nouveau dans ce rapport avec cet autre, qui ne fonde plus la raison comme le faisait Dieu dans les philosophies précédentes. Cet autre ne lui ouvre pas la porte du ciel, mais la renvoie vers une conscience plus aiguë de soi, une conscience qui ne connaît plus son propre fondement. Ainsi la raison devient une raison en condition, elle participe maintenant intégralement à la condition incertaine de l'homme entier. Elle coïncide avec l'homme. Toutes ces considérations pourraient être la réflexion d'un incroyant qui, par hasard, se bute contre cet épître de S. Paul. Mais Thévenaz, en croyant authentique, accepte le rôle prépondérant de Dieu dans sa vie, même dans sa vie de philosophe. N'importe quelle activité humaine doit être une réponse à l'appel de Dieu, qui met en cause toutes les valeurs humaines en les déclarant insuffisantes pour Le trouver. Comment d~<br>

Abstract: L'accord entre psychanalyse et philosophie ne s'est toujours pas fait. Pourtant les psychanalystes s'intéressent à Heidegger et il y a des philosophes heideggeriens qui lisent Freud et Lacan. Les thèmes d'intérêt commun se situent tous autour de la problématique du langage : la découverte d'un décentrement, la „fin de la métaphysique” et un certain parallélisme entre l'impensé et l'inconscient. On ne peut pas expliquer le rapport entre philosophie et psychanalyse dans les termes de la problématique traditionnelle philosophie-science. La psychanalyse met en question aussi bien la philosophie que la science en les prenant comme un discours qui n'est pasessentiellement différent du discours du patient dans la cure analytique. Ce discours, c'est l'homme qui le tient pour un autre ; en parlant il veut faire passer l'image de soi-même et du monde qui leur donne objectivité et identité. Mais l'homme n'est pas maître de ce discours, il parle en fragments qui appartiennent à une légende déjà existante. Il ne revient pas à l'analyste de nier ou d'affirmer ce discours, il n'a d'égards que pour sa continuité. La philosophie aussi bien que la science, il les prend comme des discours qui n'ont un sens que dans la mesure où leur progression porte des fruits. En prétendant qu'aussi bien la philosophie spéculative que la phénoménologie se meuvent dans l'imaginaire, la psychanalyse mène inévitablement à la question du statut de la philosophie. S'agit-il là d'un système d'affirmations fondées ou plutôt d'une interrogation sans fin ? Mais la critique psychanalytique porte aussi sur cette interrogation en tant que celle-ci est un moment du discours philosophique. C'est en tant que discours que la philosophie heideggerienne se rapproche de la psychanalyse. Elle annonce la „fin de la philosophie”, de la philosophie comme fait historique qui a pris fin avec Hegel et la science moderne. Il y a eu des philosophes, mais leur activité philosophique a été dominée de part et d'autre par une inst~<br>

Abstract: Cette conférence présente une méditation sur un livre dans lequel les problèmes philosophiques semblent déborder tant les frontières du récit de fiction que le cadre du roman dit historique. Plutôt que d'entreprendre une analyse tant soit peu exhaustive du livre de Eco, elle s'étend, tout en s'inspirant des données fournies par celui-ci, sur une question préalable, mais qui commande en un sens toute lecture ultérieure, celle notamment des connivences entre le discours philosophique et le discours littéraire, question finalement assez proche de celle du statut de la fiction dans son rapport au dire-vrai. L'auteur du Nom de la rose nous fait prendre conscience de ce rapport par la mise en place d'une série de dispositifs narratifs et discursifs relevant, d'une part, du moyen âge (la chronique, le raisonnement à partir de « principes premiers » ), d'autre part, de la modernité (le roman policier, la sémiotique ) ; il y a lieu de parler ici d'une structure polyphonique délibérément discordante, constamment traversée d'échos de livres anciens, nouveaux, voire inexistants. C'est dans ce jeu de textes se reflétant que le vrai et l'imaginaire s'entremêlent ; c'est là aussi que s'ouvre cet espace apocalyptique et ambigu où le sens momentanément en suspens est donné à se chercher et se redéfinir sur un mode encore inconnu et par conséquent catastrophique. L'image du labyrinthe acquiert ici tout son poids. L'effet signalé peut être défini comme un phénomène de dislocation. Ce même phénomène est ensuite approfondi à l'aide de trois points qui jouent dans Le nom de la rose un rôle important : 1. la rupture qu'opère dans le discours médiéval le personnage de William, 2. la signification de la souffrance dans sa relation au langage, 3. la dialectique du rire. C'est surtout ce dernier qui, à travers son rapport à l'idée de « césure » (césure du comique, césure du tragique), fait apparaître la theâtralité foncière de tout comportement humain. L'exposé se termine par l'hypothèse, pru~<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: After the 'death of God', it would be a mistake to continue to think of eros in terms of a longing for possession ofthat which one is lacking, especially in matters of religion. Alongside Plato's Diotima, Kierkegaard, Levinas and even Heidegger, an alternative view of eros is proposed in which eros is gradually letting go of its possessive cravings in order to open itself for the other. In this way, eros is bent in the directionof the unselfish service of the other. The question is then asked which kind of understanding of being is implied by this redirection of eros. The answer is taken from a thinking of the meaning of being in terms of self-givenness and self-outpooring in beings, for beings to be 'there'. Our being at the service of the other can therefore be seen as a following of the call of being in us to become adequate to the meaning of being itself.<br>

Abstract: When Nietzsche is called a radical philosopher, it is (among other reasons) because he questions (or at least claims to call into question) what other thinkers take for granted. In the article I concentrate on the way in which Nietzsche asks his questions, and how his questions (and the vocabulary which he uses to express his questions) develop through his writings. This development can be summarized with the help of a comparison between the orginal preface to the Birth of Tragedy (1872) and the new preface for the edition of 1886: it is a development from only a few and mainly rhetorical questions to a great number of intricate questions that often are selfreferential and call the questioner himself into question. The article points out how Nietzsche gradually discovers his proper question and how this search reaches it climax around 1886. This proper question turns out to be a practical or existential one: "To what extent can truth endure incorporation?" (Gay Science p. 110)<br>

Abstract: Husserlian phenomenology sets off as a fundamental rejection of those psychologisms and anthropologisms that deduce the structures of appearance from some preexisting essence of man. However, despite a clear rejection of all anthropological foundations of phenomenology, the examples of Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty show that the question of man continues to haunt the phenomenological project and constitutes something likea 'blind spot'. Relating these unspoken tensions to another historical 'scene' (the debate between the Sophists and Aristotle), the article argues why phenomenology is to be seen as the endeavor of replying to the initial Protagorean provocation to thinking.<br>

Article Title: A 'Mediterranean New Left'? Comparing and Contrasting the French PSU and the Italian PSIUP<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40041857<br>

Author(s): GORDON DANIEL A.<br>
Abstract: This article argues that Gerd-Rainer Horn's model of a 'Mediterranean New Left' encompassing both the French Parti socialiste unifié (PSU, 1960-1990) and the Italian Partito socialista italiano di unità proletaria (PSIUP, 1964-1972) needs to be significantly revised. It agrees that, half a century on from the events which gave rise to their foundation, this much misunderstood part of the political spectrum, midway between social democracy and the far left, is worthy of rescue from the 'enormous condescension of posterity', but questions how similar the two parties actually were. Major differences emerge, especially in the nature of each party's relationship with communism, with the philosovietism of the PSIUP contrasting with the PSU's evolution towards an anti-Leninist decentralist socialism of self-management. Yet, at the same time, important new evidence is uncovered about the concrete political and personal links that developed between leading intellectuals of the PSIUP and PSU, an example being the friendship of the Italian parliamentarian and theorist Lelio Basso with the journalist Gilles Martinet, later French ambassador to Italy. Other transnational links, both across the Mediterranean and to eastern Europe, are explored. Furthermore, the location of the roots of both parties in the 1940s generation of anti-fascist resistance calls into question prevailing assumptions equating the New Left with the youth of the 1960s, with wider implications for our understanding of the development of the European left across the twentieth century. Cet article affirme que le modèle de Gerd-Rainer Horn d'une ‘Nouvelle gauche méditerranéenne’, englobant à la fois le Parti socialiste unifié français (PSU, 1960-1990) et le Partito Socialista Italiano di Unità Proletaria italien (PSIUP, 1964—1972), doit être révisée de manière significative. Il montre que, un demi-siècle après les événements qui avaient donné lieu à leur fondation, cette partie souvent mal comprise du spectre po~<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Abstract: Début 1936, X., haut dirigeant de l'État-Parti, pressentant peut-être une disgrâce prochaine qui le conduira à la mort en 1937, s'exile en écriture. Pour autant, l'analyse proposée de son journal ne s'attache pas à décrire cette lente descente aux enfers qu'ont connue d'innombrables citoyens soviétiques au cours de cette histoire désorbitée. Elle tente de discerner divers « noeuds », lestés de paradoxes et sans doute constitutifs de la période : comment l'(il) logique de la Terreur peut être l'objet d'une appropriation par sa future victime ; comment cette même Terreur, via une déstructuration temporelle imposée à l'individu, lui dicte des formes narratives de soi ; et comment, ce faisant, l'individu en question est susceptible de reconquérir un « je ». In early 1936, probably sensing the eventual disgrace which caused his demise in 1937, an anonymous top party leader retreated into writing. The present analysis of this man's journal does not address the slow descent into hell experienced by so many Soviet citizens in those times gone mad. Rather it aims at discerning various predicaments laden with paradoxes and undoubtedly constituent of the period: how a future victim internalizes the (il) logic of Terror; how Terror dictates narrative forms of the self by causing a disruption of the individual's awareness of time; and how, in the process, the individual in question is likely to recover his sense of self.<br>

Abstract: Cet article commente la parution, en 1996, d'un ouvrage édité par la Maison des sciences de l'homme sous la direction de Daniel Fabre : L'Europe entre cultures et nations. Confrontés à une prolifération des études qui se réclament aujourd'hui d'une « ethnologie de l'Europe », les auteurs (qui furent au préalable réunis en colloque à Tours en 1993) s'efforcent d'accomplir une mission limite : consolider les bornes d'un savoir labélisé en exerçant leur puissance de discernement sur les études mises en confrontation. En est-ce ou n'en est-ce pas ? Telle serait, ici, la question. This article comments the publication in 1996 of the book Europe between cultures and nations edited by Daniel Fabre. Confronted today with a proliferation of studies claiming they are concerned with "European ethnology" the authors (who met previously at the Conference in Tours in 1993) try to accomplish a mission : confirm the limits of a labelled knowledge by exerting their capacity of discrimination between the studies confronted. Dieser Artikel kommentiert das Buch Europa zwischen Kulturen und Nationen, das unter der Leitung von Daniel Fabre in 1996 veröffentlicht wurde. Konfrontiert mit der schnellen Zunahme von Studien, die sich heute auf Europäische Ethnologie berufen, versuchen die Autoren (die in 1993 an der Konferenz in Tours zusammentrafen) eine Mission zu erfüllen : die Grenzen eines labellierten Wissens zu sichern, indem sie ihr Unterscheidungsvermögen auf die verschiedenen Studien ausüben.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur analyse les deux figures du dépassement de la métaphysique qui ont existé au XXe siècle : la phénoménologie, après être partie d'une vigoureuse critique de la métaphysique, d'inspiration positiviste, a tendu à devenir une nouvelle sorte de métaphysique, puis, comme telle, a subi la critique de la philosophie analytique naissante. La question est posée de savoir ce qui pourrait être conservé aujourd'hui des deux traditions, phénoménologique et analytique, en termes de critique de la métaphysique. The author analyses both the figures of the overcoming of metaphysics that existed in the XXth century : after starting from a strong criticism against metaphysics, of a positivist inspiration, phenomenology has tended to become a new kind of metaphysics, and then, as such, suffered the criticism of the newborn Analytic philosophy. The question is : what can be preserved now from both traditions, i.e. the phenomenological and the Analytic, in terms of a criticism of metaphysics ?<br>

Abstract: Quatre recueils récents comportant des contributions de philosophes allemands et américains permettent de préciser et discuter les grandes questions soulevées aujourd'hui par diverses traditions de lecture de Hegel, en particulier, la question d'une lecture morale de la « reconnaissance » dans la Phénoménologie de l'esprit, la théorie de la connaissance, le statut de la beauté. Four recent collections offering contributions by German and American philoso­phers allow us to discuss with greater precision the major questions raised today by different traditions of reading Hegel, notably in regard to the question of a moral reading of the concept of "recognition" in the Phenomenology of the mind, the theory of knowledge, the status of beauty.<br>

Author(s): Aubry Gwenaëlle<br>
Abstract: Les études ici réunies visent à explorer la résurgence, dans la philosophie et la théologie contemporaines, du motif de l'impuissance de Dieu. La question n'est plus seulement celle, comme dans la pensée médiévale, de la limitation de la toute-puissance divine, mais bien de son complet abandon. Elle est étroitement liée à l'interrogation sur ce que peut être une théologie d'après la Shoah, et elle préside aussi, chez des penseurs comme Hans Jonas, Gianni Vattimo, ou Giorgio Agamben, au redéploiement des problèmes du mal et de la création, des concepts théologiques de kénose et d'incarnation, ou encore des catégories aristotéliciennes de la puissance. The contributions assembled here explore the resurgence in contemporary philosophy and theology of the notion of a powerless God. What is at stake here is no longer the medieval question of limitations of divine omnipotence, but its radical abandonment. This is closely linked to the question of a new post-Shoah theology. Among thinkers such as Hans Jonas, Gianni Vattimo, or Giorgio Agamben, it presides over a re-examination of the problems of evil and creation, of the theological concepts of kenosis and incarnation or even the Aristotelian categories of potency.<br>

Abstract: Europe is grounded, from all sides, in traces of old inter-state and ethnic conflicts. Experience has proved that they can still be re-activated in spite of various forms of resolution in the past. History is welcome in the present, and we can observe mobilisation among agents, populations of victims, or despoiled groups, which have been forgotten or forced into silence through post-conflictual issues. Various interest groups, political parties, or states, build up memorial resources that they incorporate in their actions list of historicist strategies, with the aim of 'recycling' the representations of the symbolic pasts into contemporary political games. These mobilisations meet the reconciliation trends coming from society (for example, informal groups, NGOs, and so on), or are taken in charge by national and international institutions – which are becoming more and more routine - especially under the influence of the circulation of 'good' models of the pacification of resentments, containing a highly normative tone. The question is to know whether, in spite of the apparent heterogeneity of this phenomenon, the historicist games do constitute a common indicator of the state of political regimes, especially democracies, and also of the strength of that supranational construction called the EU. This question necessitates the revisiting of the dominant concepts in the field of the political sociology of memory. The international circulation of reconciliation grammars, and the fact that memory issues are being torn out of their national frameworks and exploited in several arenas, both internal and external, in order to increase their yield of political resources, are further evidence that the paradigms heretofore dominant in the social sciences are now at an impasse.<br>

Abstract: Que ce soit à l'IUFM ou à l'Université en Sciences de l'Éducation, les enseignants sont de plus en plus confrontés à la diversité des expériences des parcours de formation des étudiants à qui ils s'adressent. Cette pluralité n'impose-t-elle pas un changement des pratiques de formation et notamment le développement, dans les groupes de travail, d'une communication favorisant la symbiose des divers apports culturels de ces étudiants ? L'utilisation des biographies ou des histoires de vie en formation ne peut-elle pas permettre d'instrumenter ce travail et notamment faciliter la prise en compte des itinéraires individuels de formation ? The students are more specifically invited to meditate on the development of their curriculum. The building of their formative biography creates the mental space that is needed to question the ideas and notions which will allow them to use biography as an instrument to identify the mental representations as well as the events and situations of their life from which the individual, collective, social and cultural dimensions of their activities emerged. In this sense, this research and training shows that formative life history can allow us to distance ourselves from a priori assumptions, as well as introduce students to different methods of research.<br>

Abstract: Depuis que la didactique du français s'est constituée comme champ de recherche, la question de l'enseignement de la littérature a toujours été centrale, même si l'approche didactique de la littérature apparaît davantage comme un espace de questions que comme un lieu de construction d'une théorie cohérente de la littérature, de son enseignement et de son apprentissage. Concernant l'enseignement de la littérature, la didactique du français est essentiellement un champ de discussions théoriques, qui portent aussi bien sur le statut des objets enseignables et sur les conditions de leur enseignabilité que sur la sélection des outils théoriques permettant l'approche de ces objets. Si, aux fondements de la didactique de la littérature, c'est la contestation de l'enseignement traditionnel qui domine, sur des postulats théoriques à forte teneur idéologique, de nombreuses recherches descriptives ont interrogé aussi bien la notion de littérature que les pratiques de lecture des élèves comme les pratiques effectives d'enseignement de la littérature. Au cœur des recherches didactiques se place la question de la sélection des savoirs et des pratiques (lecture et écriture notamment) susceptibles de devenir objets d'enseignement et d'apprentissage, à tous les niveaux du cursus scolaire. Since the didactics of French formed a research field, the question of teaching literature has constantly been crucial, even if the didactical approach of literature seems more like a forum to ask questions, rather than a place where a coherent theory on literature, its teaching and learning is being developed. As for teaching literature, the didactics of French is mainly an area of theoretical discussion as much about the status of objects to be taught and the conditions on which they can be taught as how to select theoretical tools to approach those objects. If, of all the founding elements of didactics of literature, objecting to traditional teaching is the main element based on theoretical postu~<br>

Abstract: Le rapport qu'entretiennent histoire et mémoire à l'école est complexe et ambigu. Jusqu'aux années quatrevingt-dix, il a surtout été posé comme la relation, légitimée ou dénoncée, entre savoirs historiques, histoire scolaire et mémoire nationale. Dès les années soixante, le débat prend en compte le rapport entre le récit national et des histoires régionalistes qui revendiquent une place dans la culture scolaire, au nom des identités et du droit au passé. Cette dernière acception prévaut largement à l'heure actuelle mais cette fois au nom des minorités dépossédées de leur histoire, dès lors qu'elle n'a pas d'expression publique. Dans ces débats, la mémoire serait la forme d'une histoire parallèle, occultée et clandestine ; de leur côté les historiens tendent à distinguer histoire et mémoire. L'histoire scolaire, elle, admet l'histoire mais non les mémoires comme savoir de référence légitime ; pourtant les commémorations et le « devoir de mémoire » s'y invitent de plus en plus fréquemment. De telles évolutions interrogent les composantes de la discipline scolaire : au premier chef les finalités et les contenus mais aussi les pratiques, inégalement connues dans ce domaine et, finalement, les apprentissages souvent plus espérés qu'avérés. The connection that exists at school between history and memory is complicated and ambiguous; it is source of debate and demands which recently intensified with public and political uses. School history accepts history but not memories as good legitimate reference. And yet commemoration ceremonies and the "duty to remember" are more and more in the schools. Such changes question the elements of that school subject: its purpose of building identity and citizenship, its contents and their changes, its teaching practices, not really evenly known in this field, and finally the learning that is more often wished for than actually delivered. La relación que mantienen historia y memoria en la Escuela es compleja y ambigua; alimenta debates y ~<br>

Abstract: O artigo pretende apresentar um novo modelo de distribuição das ajudas sociais na França, modelo esse entretanto conhecido pelo nome de "alocação personalizada". Trata-se de um mecanismo que, em seu mesmo funcionamento e nas suas justificações éticas, se opõe seja ao sistema actual dominante, herdeiro do Estado-Provi-dência, seja ao projecto alternativo de alocação universal, ou basic income, entretanto amplamente debatido. Objectivo principal do artigo, porém, é explorar os fundamentos filosóficos subjacentes à proposta em causa. Tal como o próprio nome indica, o princípio da "alocação personalizada" apoia-se sobre o contributo de uma filosofia social específica, o personalismo. Assim, evocando principalmente os escritos de Emmanuel Mounier e de Max Scheler, os autores pretendem mostrar até que ponto esta filosofia social suporta uma concepção original da solidariedade, ela própria fundada sobre uma relação específica aos outros. Neste sentido, a proposta que aqui se faz em favor de uma "alocação personalizada" pode ser lida e interpretada como uma aplicação directa da perspectiva personalista a um problema preciso de economia política, a saber, o da organização da assistência social. This paper intends to present a new model for distribution of social assistance in France, a model which has been known by the name of "personalized allocation". It is a mechanism which opposes itself, in its own functioning and in its ethical justifications, both to the present dominant system, heir to the Welfare State, and to the alternative project of universal allocation, or basic income, which in the mean-while has been largely debated. The main aim of this paper, then, is to explore the philosophical fundaments underlying the proposal of the model in question. Like the very name indicates, the principle of "personalized allocation" is based on the contribution of a specific social philosophy, namely personalism. Thus, chiefly calling forth the writings of Emmanuel Mounier and M~<br>

Abstract: Dans cet article, nous évoquerons la question des témoignages de la Shoah et des circonstances de leur énonciation. A cet effet, nous décrirons cet objet sociodiscursif particulier qu'est le témoignage, en détaillant ses composantes définitoires (certification autobiographique, pacte de référentialité, portée collective, etc.), en réfléchissant sur les conditions de son accréditation et en le comparant aux autres modalités et stratégies discursives (discours de l'historien, récit littéraire, etc.) utilisées pour transmettre cette réalité extrême et non partagée de la déportation et de l'expérience concentrationnaire. In this paper, I focus on the question of the testimonies of the Shoah and the circumstances of their creation. The testimony, a specific sociodiscursive object, is described by detailling its defining elements (autobiographical certification, referentiality pact, collective thrust, etc.), by reflecting on the conditions of its accreditation and by comparing it to the other discursive modalities and strategies (the discourse of the historian, literary accounts, etc.) used to convey the extreme and unshared reality of deportation and the experience of concentration camps.<br>

Abstract: Robert Morrison Maclver — Franklin Giddings' successor at the Columbia University was a leading opponent of positivism (George Lundberg), empricism (William Ogburn) and antitheoretical praxism (Robert Lynd). Maclver developed sociological theorizing along the Weberian tradition. The paper focuses on the temporality concerns of Maclver: 1) the question of distinct qualitative times, 2) the question of various temporal modes of being in the sociocultural realm, 3) temporality in social action. Maclver, unrecognized by today's symbolic interactionists, sought the implications of George H. Mead's work on time for analysis of activity as dynamic remaking of the present. The unity of the meaningful or symbolic and the temporal aspects of social pheomena was evident in the Maclver's theorizing. In consonance with the Bergsonian criticism of scientific mechanism Maclver was critical of variable-centered methodology. He analyzed the temporal modes of being of events, processes and cultural objects and focused on different ways society, history and culture enter the time process. Maclver made the temporality of actions the key issue. He should be classified as symbolic interactionist along with Florian Znaniecki and Pitirim Sorokin.<br>

Abstract: Animal-standpoint criticism is a new vein in literary criticism that questions ideologically-driven representations of animals, their aesthetic exploitation, their absence or silence in literary texts, and the obliviousness of earlier critics to these issues. This article briefly summarizes the main tenets of animal-standpoint criticism to date. Its main focus is then on the question of aesthetic exploitation of animal cruelty, in particular on the pervasive use in contemporary American fiction of the animal proxy, an animal figure whose suffering is largely for aesthetic effect.<br>

Abstract: El autor reflexiona sobre la evolución de la historia del discurso en Francia y su aproximación a la historia semántica, inspirada en la obra de Koselleck, y a la historia del discurso de tradición anglosajona. Tras repasar los antecedentes de la actual historia del discurso francesa desde los años setenta y evaluar la influencia de la obra de Foucault en esta disciplina, el autor aborda, a la luz de los últimos trabajos de Quentin Skinner, la cuestión de la intencionalidad individual y colectiva de los textos históricos, es decir, los mecanismos que constituyen y explican, en palabras de Koselleck, «la conexión empírica entre la realidad y el discurso». The author thinks about the evolution of the history of discourse in France and its approach to semantic history as inspired by the work of Koselleck, and also to the history of discourse in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. After revising the precedents of the current French history of speech from the 70s and evaluating the influence of the work of Foucault in this discipline, the author approaches, in the light of Quentin Skinner's last works, the question of the individual and collective premeditation of historical texts, that is to say, the mechanisms that constitute and explain, in words of Koselleck, «the empirical connection between reality and discourse».<br>

Abstract: Los estudios sociales sobre alimentación y las autoridades responsables de este campo coinciden en resaltar la situación paradójica del comensal actual: se sabe cómo se debe comer pero no se come como se debe. Enfrentarse con éxito a las paradojas suele requerir un cierto distanciamiento —lingüístico y disciplinar— que ofrezca la suficiente perspectiva. Aquí se propone hacerlo desde la perspectiva histórica que una sociología de la utopía puede aportar al conflicto entre imaginarios alimentarios. Para ello, este artículo revisará los elementos comunes del pensamiento utópico/distópico en orden a extraer las categorías de mayor interés para un análisis sociológico de las políticas y comportamientos alimentarios. Después, recorreremos los modos en que algunas de las utopías clásicas han enfocado —o desenfocado— la cuestión de la comida e intentaremos sacar algunas conclusiones. Social studies on food and nutritional authorities coincide in emphasizing the paradoxical situation of the modern eater: people know how they should eat but do not eat as they should. Dealing with paradoxes successfully usually requires a certain —linguistic and disciplinary— distance to gain sufficient perspective. We suggest this should be done from the historical perspective that a sociology of utopia offers on the conflict between food imaginaries. To this end, we outline the common elements of utopian/dystopian thought in order to extract the categories of major interest for a sociological analysis of food policies and eating behaviours. Subsequently, we trace the ways in which some classical utopias and dystopias have focused on —or blurred— the question of food and we try to draw some conclusions.<br>

Abstract: L'attachement au pays d'origine est bien analysé pour les diasporas contemporaines afin de démontrer leur dimension transnationale et décrire leurs rapports avec l'État-nation. Pour les XVIe-XVIIIe siècles, en revanche, cette question pourtant fondamentale est minorée au profit des liens entre communautés. Souhaitant sortir des perspectives mono-confessionnelles qui limitent l'historiographie des diasporas modernes, ce travail s'appuie sur l'étude de quatre groupes dispersés : les séfarades, les catholiques britanniques, les huguenots et les morisques. La terre d'origine, qui grave son empreinte culturelle sur la diaspora, constitue un liant structurant fondamental : lieu de l'événement-déclencheur de dispersion et du martyre, elle apparaît comme le front de la résistance qui légitime l'existence de « l'arrière » , la diaspora. Territoire matriciel, souvent mythifié et mobilisé dans les visions messianiques, elle est indissociable de la notion de retour. The attachment to the country of origin is well analyzed for contemporary diasporas to demonstrate their transnational dimension and to describe their relationship with the nation-state. For the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, however, the historiography has emphasized the relationship between communities, overlooking this important issue. Putting aside mono-denominational perspectives, this article offers a new approach to early-modern diasporas by confronting four groups: the Sephardim, the British Catholics, the Huguenots and the Moriscos. The cultural imprint of the homeland was a core structure of diasporas. The locus of both martyrdom and the trigger-event of dispersion, the homeland appeared as the front line of resistance, legitimizing the existence of the "rear", i.e. the Diaspora. Often mythologized and mobilized in messianic visions, this crucial territory was inseparable from the notion of return.<br>

Abstract: Le courage, vertu première, dont traite le cycle caribéen d'André et Simone Schwarz-Bart met en évidence la visée éthique de ces oeuvres: dignité et sagesse. Cette visée éthique n'est nullement un renoncement, comme on pourrait le croire par le récit de vies parsemées d'épreuves, mais un "bonheur mélancolique" pour reprendre les termes de Simone Schwarz-Bart ou un "bonheur désespérément" pour reprendre ceux d'André Comte-Sponville, c'est-à-dire un bonheur dans l'agir, le vouloir et non dans l'espérance. Dans cet article, il s'agit de méditer sur la question du "comment vivre?", et non pas du "que faire?", au coeur de l'oeuvre d'André et Simone Schwarz-Bart, qui souligne, au-delà ou en deçà du postcolonial, le sens de leur humanisme.<br>

Article Title: The Detraditionalization of Intimacy Reconsidered<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i388289<br>
Date: 9 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wilson Neil<br>
Abstract: This essay challenges those strains of contemporary social theory that regard romantic/sexual intimacy as a premier site of detraditionalization in the late modern era. Striking changes have occurred in intimacy and family life over the last half-century, but the notion of detraditionalization as currently formulated does not capture them very well. With the goal of achieving a more refined understanding, the article proposes a distinction between "regulative" and "meaning-constitutive" traditions. The former involve threats of exclusion from various moral communities; the latter involve linguistic and cultural frameworks within which sense is made of the world. Focusing on the U.S. case and marshaling various kinds of empirical evidence, the article argues that while the regulative tradition of what it terms lifelong, internally stratified marriage has declined in strength in recent years, the image of the form of couplehood inscribed in this regulative tradition continues to function as a hegemonic ideal in many American intimate relationships. Intimacy in the United States also remains beholden to the tradition of romantic love. That these meaning-constitutive traditions continue to play a central role in structuring contemporary intimacy suggests that detraditionalization involves the relative decline only of certain regulative traditions, a point that calls into question some of the normative assessments that often accompany the detraditionalization thesis.<br>

Abstract: The author presents a concise and peculiar view on the studies and researches which have been developed in the last 30 years or so about the social dimension of time. The article underlies the persisting validity of the idea of time as a socio-cultural institution (Durkheim and his school) and as a social construction (Berger and Luckmann); it also hints at the concept of «temporal culture», which has been rarely employed in studies concerning social times. According to the author, the main transformation concerning social times today is represented by the consequences of globalization and related aspects, such as «agglutination» of experiences concerning communication through space-time. In the last paragraph the question of rhythm in general and particularly of social rhythms is discussed: the author argues that this concept, distinct from time, deserves much more attention than it has received until now by social scientists interested in the subject.<br>

Abstract: In 1884 an Ottoman public prosecutor and fellow officials stood trial for abusing their official authorities when attending to an incident in one of Istanbul's neighborhoods. A published verbatim report of the proceedings is used in this article for discussing Ottoman socio-legal change in the late nineteenth century, employing a microhistorical perspective. Following a major reform in the new court system, which was established in the 1860s (the Nizamiye courts), the judicial authorities used the trial in question for transmitting the commitment of the modernizing state to the rule of law, exhibited by the principle of officials' accountability. Features of the reformed judicial system and its distinctive legal culture are demonstrated in this article by unfolding the judicial aspects of this episode and by discussing connections between them and the immediate socio-political and socio-legal contexts of the trial.<br>

Abstract: Any praxis is inscribed in time. To what extent does man's perception of time leave an inprint on Saussurian 'langue' ? Revisiting a well-beaten track in linguistic studies, we propose to give this farreaching question a partial answer concerning the opposition between French imparfait and passé simple. We first capture the opposition between those two tenses in a passive way, in which man as a subject (subjected to...) bears witness to the flow of time from future to past; we then capture the opposition in an active way, in which man as a project bears witness to the flow of time from past to future. This two-fold representation bears on the opposition between imperfect and simple past. It is shown next that linguistic theories view tenses as markers of localisation in time whereas verb forms also help mark how the time implied by the process is viewed, what orientation is given to it. Our contention is that implied time is represented in a downward fashion (particularisation) with imperfect and in an upward fashion (generalisation) with simple past.<br>

Abstract: To refer to reality in literature has often been incorrectly understood as the fact that the author designates elements of the real world of his time, term for term as it were and as if everyone would agree on what constitutes "the real world of his time"; from this point of view, an author such as Proust is cut off from reality... This is to miss the degree to which Proust's practice of language asks the relevant questions about reference as it tries to refer to reality, namely the phenomenological question of the way we dynamically construct at least the reality we perceive.<br>

Abstract: The issue is the manner in which the reading of literature can constitute an everyday existential resource, without construing this use of reading in an excessively instrumental manner. The key resides in the formal characters rendering a literary element notable, memorable, and/or quotable, both privately and collectively, inasmuch as the orientation of these elements is the becoming of the reader(s), not their past. La question est celle de la façon dont la littérature peut représenter une ressource dans la vie quotidienne, sans concevoir un tel usage de la lecture littéraire comme purement instrumental. Un tel usage de la lecture se trouve lorsque les caractéristiques formelles qui rendent, individuellement ou collectivement, notable, mémorable ou citable tel ou tel passage littéraire s'accompagnent d'une orientation vers l'avenir du lecteur, et non vers la rétrospection.<br>

Abstract: History is a passage from an « I-truth » to a « He-truth » through an « Ustruth » where the nature of who resides in the us, and the capacity for it to an assumed « We-truth », determines the transformation into a « He-truth » - with the pitfall that an « I-truth » can disguise as a « He-truth » by restricting its « Us » aspects, and anyway be read as such. Reading Learning Each Other's Historical Narrative through the prism of Greek history and political thought enables it to be seen as a step in the direction of the constitution of a « we » encompassing what are as yet two « us »'s... L'histoire est un passage d'un « Je-vrai » à un « Il-vrai » au travers d'un « On-vrai » , où la question de qui se tient derrière ce « on » et de sa capacité à assumer un « nous » détermine le passage au « Il-vrai » -avec le risque qu'un « Je-vrai » peut se déguiser en « Il-vrai » en restreignant l'accès au « On », et en tout cas peut toujours être lu ainsi. La lecture d'Histoire de l'autre au moyen du filtre de l'histoire et de la pensée politique grecques permet de le voir comme une étape dans la construction d'un « nous » rassemblant ce qui ne sont pour le moment que deux « on »...<br>

Abstract: Le long sillon tracé par Jean-Claude Coquet pour labourer le champ d'une sémiotique phénoménologique (qu'elle soit nommée « subjectale », « du continu », « continuiste », ou encore « des instances ») ne pouvait qu'être... sensible au sensible. À travers plusieurs interventions des dernières années (de l'ouvrage de 2007 sur le jeu de phusis et de logos jusqu'à une communication vénitienne de 2010), on cherche à discerner quelques vertus d'une telle approche : ce qu'elle permet d'entrevoir pour traiter la question de l'empêtrement, ce qu'elle autorise à penser de la problématique du kairos, et, dans le prolongement, ce qu'elle appelle à approfondir pour lire certain tableau de plate peinture. Jean-Claude Coquet has long dug furrows in order to prepare the field for a phenomenological semiotics (a semiotics variously dubbed "subjectal", "of continuity", "continuistic", or yet "grounded in its ' instances'"), and his endeavour could only be... sensitive to the sensible universe. Through a number of recent works (from the 2007 work on the play of Phusis and Logos to a talk in Venice in 2010), the virtues of such an approach are articulated: what it enables us to catch a glimpse of pertaining to certain issues regarding the question of entanglement (empêtrement), what it allows us to think about other issues pertinent to the problematic of kairos, and, going forward, what needs to be thought through in order to read a given work of plain painting.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents a history of the large group approach in relation to Foulkesian group analytic psychotherapy, including the nature of this approach in relation to Foulkesian principles. Much of the theory reflects Foulkes's attitude, but there are also clear distinctions made, notably a new stance in our thinking about groups as a result of the increase in size (i.e., a membership of about 20), the introduction of the cultural dimension which this increase entails, and the question of what happens after the resolution of Kleinian, oedipal and familial conflicts has been achieved in psychoanalysis and small groups, notably what happens once "exile" has been achieved. The approach presented proposes to handle the frustration and hate that these conflicts engender in the form of negative or antilibidinal energies, and their transformation into psychic energy, through dialogue leading from hate to the establishment of koinonia, or impersonal fellowship, and of microcultural influences which promote rather than inhibit communication. Being neither small nor large, a group of about 20 members has become known as a "median" group.<br>

Abstract: Enquadrar de um modo filosófico, educacional e político a questão do "Testamento Vital" (ou "Diretivas Antecipadas de Tratamento") pressupõe não haver dúvidas sobre o seu conteúdo. Por isso, este artigo pretende, numa primeira parte, e atendendo às dúvidas existentes em Portugal, explicitar de que falamos quando falamos de "Testamento Vital". Só então seräo abordadas temáticas mais complexas que nos alertam para o facto de o "Testamento Vital" não ser um mero instrumento de regulação de vontades em relação ao fim de vida, mas remeter para economías específicas de verdade, valor e poder que pressupõem respostas distintas a perguntas fundamentais que o ser humano faz sobre si próprio: a sua suposta "natureza", a liberdade ou não de determinar o seu destino, o significado da tolerãncia ou o que é fazer e respeitar o "bem" dos outros. Finalmente, um último ponto tratará de uma problemática muito específica dentro do questionamento geral em torno do "Testamento Vital", que é a da autonomia prospetiva, pois esse "Testamento" visa determinar agora o que pretendemos que nos façam no futuro em termos de cuidados de saúde, caso estejamos na altura incapazes de decidir. Este último ponto será elaborado com base em reflexōes de Ronald Dworkin. In order to frame in a philosophical, educational and political way the issue of the living wilb (or Advance Directives of Treatment) we should assume that there are no doubts about their meaning. As this is not the case in Portugal, the first part of this article will address this question. Only then will we be confronted with more complex subjects, in order to develop the idea that living wilh are not just a mere instrument that regulate end-of-life issues, but involve specific economies of truth, value and power that imply different answers to fundamental questions that human beings put to themselves: their supposed "nature", their freedom to determine or not their destiny, the meaning of tolerance or what it means to do and to respect~<br>

Abstract: This paper raises the question whether language and violence are internally connected. It starts from the experience of violence and from its theoretical interpretation as violence in the context of political forms of life which are challenged by complaints about violence. Such forms of life have to confront this issue because they are supposed to be responsive to claims and demands of others who articulate violence as an experience of violation. Whether a kind of responsive ethos may be based on the suspected inner connection between language and violence is being discussed at the end.<br>

Author(s): Pestre Dominique<br>
Abstract: What I consider in this paper are various forms of government, various technologies and discursive regimes of government that are in common use today. What interests me are the categories and tools, practical dispositifs and languages that developed over the last decades 'to constitute, define, organize, and instrumentalize the strategies that individuals, acting freely, may use to deal with one another' (Foucault). The paper considers first the neo-liberal wish to reassert the individual as alone in responsibility for his/her own life after the unfortunate digression into Welfare Statism and Keynesian economics, source of all ills. It then focuses on some material and social technologies that encourage people to accept full and complete 'self-sovereignty'. This section leads to a discussion on the new demands (and resistance) society imposed on this liberal normative ideal. It notably considers the growing demands to 'participate' in decision processes and to be environmentally friendly. In section "Les Mots et Les Choses: A New Discursive Regime", it considers the discursive regime that progressively took shape and which currently permeates international governance bodies of all stripes—from the World Bank to the Conference of Parties for Climate Change. In the final section, it comes back to the initial question and considers what these changes actually mean for the democratic order as constituted over the past 250 years.<br>

Author(s): Blatz Charles V.<br>
Abstract: Moving from repression or tyranny toward the rule of law and reason is fraught with difficulties. One question of transitional justice is whether those responsible for the horrors of the previous régime should be punished or whether those involved in the transition should travel a path toward forgiveness and unity. Within this article, it is urged that in the (re-)establishment of the rule of reason among all involved there is a commitment to peace as opposed to force. This commitment marks retribution and utilitarian punishment as incoherent and normatively indefensible. Resorting to punishment is the abandonment of reason, not its reinstatement. Indeed, the point can be generalized. Punishment, as resorting to force, is a move away from establishing or sustaining a framework of justification and its commitment to peace.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: Ensaio expositivo e interpretativo das perguntas sobre a natureza humana e das respostas que o pensamento moderno, em Merlin Donald e outros, vai dando. A perspetiva fisicalista, neurobiológica, é analisada a partir de Joseph LeDoux, e outros, comentando as suas teses principáis. É dada ênfase particular à evolução das capacidades da mente humana na transiçao da cultura mimética para a cultura oral, a criaçao mítica e o advento da escrita e das outras formas de cultura exterior simbólica. Na crítica ao monismo fisicalista é discutido o que se pode entender por qualia e de que modo este entendimento justifica a aceitação de um "hiato explicativo" como o pensam Urbano Sidoncha e outros autores. É abordada a relaçao entre Pensamento e Linguagem a partir de Lev Vygotsky. Considerando a ética como um qualia procura-se fixar, empíricamente, a diferença entre ética e eticidade como contraponto à diferença entre autoconsciência e consciência cognitiva. Como proposta final é apresentada uma pergunta radical e oferecida urna temeraria resposta sobre o possível conhecimento total da natureza humana. Expository and interpretive essay of the questions on human nature and the responses that modern thought, in Merlin Donald et al., has been producing. The physicalist, neurobiological perspective is analysed as from Joseph LeDoux et al., by commenting on his main theses. Particular emphasis is given to the evolution of the human mind's capacities in the transition from the mimetic culture to the oral culture, the mythical creation and the advent of writing and the other forms of external symbolic culture. In the critique of the physicalist monism, one discusses what can be understood by qualia and how this understanding justifies the acceptance of an 'explanatory hiatus' such as Urbano Sidoncha and other authors think. The relationship between Thought and Language, as from Lev Vygotsky, is addressed. Considering ethics as a qualia, one tries to establish, in an empirical way, the d~<br>

Author(s): KARKOWSKA MARTA<br>
Abstract: The goal of this article is to review the possibilities and limitations of applying Aleida and Jan Assmann's concept to the study of local memory, using as an example the memory of inhabitants of the Polish town of Olsztyn. The author first briefly presents selected key premises of Aleida and Jan Assmann's concept of cultural memory. She then addresses the question of how the Assmanns' concept is received and interpreted in Poland. Discussion of these issues leads to an analysis of the advantages and difficulties of applying the two German scholars' theoretical proposals to the study of memory in local communities. The author refers to the case of a moderately aggregated, urban society with a complicated multiethnic past. Her conclusions concern the challenges scholars face in adopting Aleida and Jan Assmann's theoretical perspective for studying memory and local communities in this part of Europe.<br>

Issue: i40094286<br>
Date: 6 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Brewster Chris<br>
Abstract: An interdisciplinary theoretical framework is proposed for analysing justice in global working conditions. In addition to gender and race as popular criteria to identify disadvantaged groups in organizations, in multinational corporations (MNCs) local employees (i.e. host country nationals (HCNs) working in foreign subsidiaries) deserve special attention. Their working conditions are often substantially worse than those of expatriates (i.e. parent country nationals temporarily assigned to a foreign subsidiary). Although a number of reasons have been put forward to justify such inequalities—usually with efficiency goals in mind—recent studies have used equity theory to question the extent to which they are perceived as fair by HCNs. However, since perceptual equity theory has limitations, this study develops an alternative and nonperceptual framework for analysing such inequalities. Employment discrimination theory and elements of Raw-Is's 'Theory of Justice' are the theoretical pillars of this framework. This article discusses the advantages of this approach for MNCs and identifies some expatriation practices that are fair according to our non-perceptual justice standards, whilst also reasonably (if not highly) efficient.<br>

Abstract: The study ’The meaning of action, the action of meaning’ raises the theoretical question of the relationship between the intent and meaning, the self-referentiality and referentiality of the literary text. It sets out from the hypothesis that a literary text has not only a self-referential, but also a referential character. Unlike non-literary texts whose function is their intent, the referentiality of a literary text is open. The ambiguity and polysemy of the text then results from the non-obviousness of reality itself. The concept that captures this difference between literary texts and texts with other functions is that of meaning. The study uses the concrete example of the thematicisation of the metamorphosis of a puppet, a monster or an animal into a man in Kleist, Collodi and Grass to illustrate the difference between mechanical intent founded upon efficiency and living meaning, founded on ambiguity and non-functional complexity. An analysis of Pavel Vilikovský’s novel Kôn na poschodí, slepec vo Vrábroch (’Horse Upstairs, Blind Man in Vráble’) shows how, in its thematic, ostentatiously self-referential action, meaning is born as an expression of the polysemic re fe re n tia lity of the text. The analy sis shows that behind this self-referentiality the text is also created in the referential action of meaning to such an extent that it is precisely the open action of meaning which becomes the r » on-obvious sense of the action of the text.<br>

Author(s): Špirit Michael<br>
Abstract: This article discusses the attitude of the Czech literary critic Václav Černý to his fellow critic and compatriot F. X. Šalda, that is to say, Černý's self-stylization, which was defined in polemical reference to Šalda, and also the way Černý 'broadcast' it or concealed it - the primary feature of his technique. Concerning the question of whether literary criticism is a science or an art, the author does not state that Šalda was correct in his Stance against Černý nor, for that matter, that Černý was correct in his against Šalda: the construct of Černý's 'Co je kritika, co není a k čemu je na světě' [What Criticism Is, What It Is Not, and Why It Exists at All] is just as valid as Šalda's claim. The article seeks to demonstrate that in particular it was in his conception of literary criticism that Černý needed to distance himself from Šalda. The fact that Černý could argue for his own method only thanks to Šalda's not having declared criticism a science is only seemingly a paradox. The article also points out parallels between Šalda’s Boje o zítřek and Černý's Osobnost, tvorba a boj, which are interesting particularly for the way the narrow correspondence between the two works then stands out and how Černý in fact barely discussed Šalda at ali. The affinity of the two critics emphasizes how important it was for Černý to stress the difference between himself and his predecessor in the very area in which he was in fact most similar to him.<br>

Abstract: In the late twentieth century two conceptions of text in a literary work followed from the original distinction between Sinn (smysl, sense) and Bedeutung (význam, reference), which was made by Gottlob Frege in 1892 - namely, those of Wolfgang Iser and Paul Ricoeur. For us, they are interesting for their direct or indirect affinity to Czech Structuralism. The article presents a detailed comparison of the two conceptions: Iser's 'act of reading', culminating in the 'play of the text', and Ricoeur's proposal of 'productive reference', which heads towards the references (Bedeutungen) of a world that is irmagined, without actually being, and announces itself through the creative power of language. The article concludes by returning to the question of the game and reference in the work of Iser and Eugene Fink. Play and art guard the vitality of sense.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Abstract: Entre Phistoricisme occidental théorisé à la fin du 19e siècle et le «présentisme» qui caractérise la fin du 20e siècle, les années 1950 constituent un moment charnière: celui où le paradigme structuraliste abolit l'histoire et précipite le basculement des sociétés occidentals d'un régime d'historicité à un autre. La décomposition du temps en trois temporalités distinctes et Pinvention de la longue durée proposées par Fernand Braudel sont alors la réponse des historiens à la révolution épistémologique que constitue l'anthropologie structurale définie par Claude Lévi-Strauss. Dans cette contribution, on se demande si le basculement vers un nouveau «régime d'historicité» ne date pas du moment triomphal d'un paradigme qui a réussi à unifier toutes les sciences humaines, le structuralisme, dans les années 1960. Son succès provient de plusieurs facteurs: l'émergence sur la scène de l'histoire de la figure de l'autre, incarnée par les peuples du tiers-monde qui combattaient pour leur indépendance et rejetaient la greffe occidentale. Il tient aussi à la crise des eschatologies révolutionnaires résultant des découvertes du Goulag. Il en a résulté un repli sur le scientisme, une mise en cause radicale d'un telos occidentalocentré et une mise à l'écart de toute forme de logique temporelle. C'est ainsi que Clio est temporairement en exil et les historiens se tournent euxmemes vers les plages de la longue durée, privilégiant un temps presque immobile. This paper addresses the question of the shift towards a new "regime of historicity" and posits that the triumphant moment of a paradigm that succeeded in unifying all the social sciences, structuralism, occurred in the 1960s. Its success was due to several factors: the rise of the figure of the other on the historical stage, embodied by people from the third world who fought for their independence and rejected the western transplant. It was also due to the crisis of revolutionary eschatologies stemming from the discoveries of the~<br>

Issue: i40104982<br>
Date: 6 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Bohnekamp Dorothea<br>
Abstract: On sait combien l'Allemagne fédérale a construit sa légitimité démocratique sur le traitement de la mémoire de la Shoah. Mais comment la communauté juive présente dans le pays a-t-elle reçu cette mémoire ? Cet article tente de répondre a cette question en s'appuyant notamment sur la presse judéo-allemande et en dressant une chronologie depuis la guerre. Dorothea Bohnekamp montre comment, apres la désillusion des communautes juives apres 1945 face à l'absence d'intérêt manifeste par les autorités à leur endroit, 1952 représente un tournant, quand l'attention portee à la vie juive en Allemagne devient un critère d'évaluation de la democratisation de la RFA. L'après-1989 constitue une nouvelle étape, avec l'arrivée massive de Juifs russophones renouvelant la vie communautaire. Toutefois les debats passionnés sur le Musée juif de Berlin ou sur le Mémorial de l'Holocauste invitent à se demander dans quelle mesure les Juifs vivant en Allemagne ne sont pas en définitive dépossédés de la mémoire de la Shoah au profit des descendants des bourreaux. Centrale au sein de la culturelle mémorielle allemande, la mémoire de la Shoah reste un imperatif politique fort en République fédérale allemande, dont Pidentite democratique s'est construite en opposition absolue au nazisme. Après le déni des crimes nazis dans l'après-guerre, la réactivation du passé depuis les annees 1970 participe d'une représentation politique du judaïsme considérée comme symbole de la culture républicaine du pays. Or, les nombreuses expressions de la culture mémorielle en Allemagne (musées, mémoriaux, etc.) ont souvent été sujet à polémique, dans la mesure où leur utilisation publique reflète aussi la difficulté à imprimer une logique collective à des souvenirs traumatiques irréductiblement individuels. Si les communautés judéo-allemandes renaissent depuis la Réunification, elles ne se sentent pas toujours pleinement représentees par la culture memorielle officielle et restent réfractaires a toute instrumenta~<br>

Article Title: New Reading Histories, Print Culture and the Identification of Change: The Case of Eighteenth-Century England<br>
Publisher: Routledge<br>
Issue: i394465<br>
Date: 10 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): White James<br>
Abstract: This article considers the consequences of new reading histories that have pursued the question of reading practices -- how people read texts, rather than just who readers were and what it was that they read. New theoretical considerations widen our appreciation of the difficulty in recovering the history of reading, but they must also confront the limitations and peculiarities of the evidence available. Using eighteenth-century England as a case study, the article reviews recent work -- much from diverse research not usually associated with reading history -- and assesses the potential for future study. Important questions about the relationship between literature, belief and action, about the nature of 'popular' and 'elite' culture, about the archaeology of political and social thought, and about the dissemination and control of ideas, cannot be determined without asking what reading meant. Such enquiry is particularly rewarding in writing the history of the transitional and diverse society of eighteenth-century England. It also reinforces concern that pursuit of new reading histories through an exploration of reading practice can marginalise the evaluation of change by concentrating on an examination of the singular and the synchronic. Only by the broadest research strategies, the article suggests, can new reading history most fully contribute to an understanding of eighteenth-century English social history.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40109964<br>
Date: 1 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Corradi Consuelo<br>
Abstract: A lively concern for new instruments of knowledge has led sociology, among other disciplines, to collect life stories in order to explore social phenomena. Dialogue and interpersonal communication thus become crucial tools, as well as loci of knowledge. This paper investigates the epistemological suppositions of 'the biographical approach': the quest for identity in the narrative, the dialogical relationship between the narrating self and the researcher, the fixation of speech into text and more. The overall effort of the investigation is to reach criteria of analysis which are not simply borrowed from other areas, but are the outcome of reflection upon the constituent features of life stories. This investigation, however, does not widen the gap between 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' sociology, but rather it contributes to put this division into question.<br>

Author(s): Raney Roslyn<br>
Abstract: Can fixed images tell a story; do autonomous visual stories exist? In order to answer this question, two categories of narrative images are considered: series like tapestries, which constitute together one narration, and on the other hand single paintings. Historical paintings representing a collectivity can suggest temporal evolution (like Poussin's Manna in the Desert) while those which represent one central hero must choose the "pregnant moment" of peripeteia (like Rembrandt's The Feast of Balthazar). The conclusion is that autonomous visual stories cannot be developed alongside existing verbal (literary) stories.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113399<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Haney David P.<br>
Abstract: In the apostrophe to "Imagination" in The Prelude, Book 6, a multileveled usurpation occurs which challenges the rhetorical foundation of Wordsworth's poem. The force of will exhibited in this passage is a paradoxical combination of actively exerted power and effortlessness, forced interruption and passively suffered usurpation, in which both the agent and the object of usurpation are put into question. The essential trope in this gesture is the anomalous figure of catachresis, whose uneasy place in eighteenth-century rhetorical classifications resulted from its combination of absolute propriety and absolute impropriety. For Wordsworth, this trope reveals the paradoxical connection between the powerful ground of the imagination's proper being and the abyss of loss and impropriety which threatens the imaginative will.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113403<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ronen Ruth<br>
Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Abstract: Where we were, where we are, where we seem to be heading is a question for narratology in its third decade. The key word for the future seems to be evolution: the discipline is undergoing mutations to adapt to a scholarly environment that reflects, on the one hand, the progress of ideas that have cast the spotlight on literary genetics, cognitive theories, feminist approaches, or social semiotics and, on the other, galloping dissemination and unsettling ambivalence about an unprecedented popularity that is transforming the very definition of narrative itself.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113412<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Ryan Marie-Laure<br>
Abstract: Narratology has explored in depth the modes of narration, but it has left largely untouched the question of the modes of narrativity. This term designates the various ways in which narrative structures are realized in texts. To call a novel or short story narrative is an entirely different matter from that of applying the same term to a lyric poem or a drama. The study of the modes of narrativity attempts to answer the question: what does it mean to say "this text is narrative"? As a cognitive category necessary to the proper understanding of a work, the narrative structure of a text may be compared to the identifiable shape of an object in a visual artwork. Thus, various modes of narrative may be compared to a type of picture or visual phenomenon.<br>

Article Title: Second-Person Narrative As a Test Case for Narratology: The Limits of Realism<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113430<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Fludernik Monika<br>
Abstract: The narratological category "person" needs to be replaced by a different conceptual framework. The traditional distinctions between narrative levels and between story and discourse are inadequate to an explanation of much postmodernist writing. Classic narratological categories correlate with a realist understanding of story and with a realist conceptualization of story telling with some postmodernist techniques of writing, such as second-person fiction, refusing to play by such conceptualizations. Gabriel Josipovici's Contre-jour is an instance of a radical deconstruction of realist parameters. Realist recuperations or naturalizations of intractable writing have to be evaluated as readings against the anti-mimetic grain of such texts, and the possibility of such narrative recuperation does not provide evidence for the reinstatement of traditional narratological distinctions. The failing of current narratology to account for second-person narrative is due to the inapplicability of traditional narratological categories, a break-down that is motivated by the ideological commitments of much postmodernist, and especially second-person, fiction since these deliberately question realistic frames of cognition and story understanding.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette étude nous abordons le problème de la réception de Mémoires d'Hadrien, à la parution du livre, à partir des témoignages des lecteurs contemporains. Les aspects sur lesquels nous nous arrêtons sont au nombre de trois: la pression exercée sur le public spécialisé par «l'affaire Hadrien», la volonté de faire de Yourcenar le symbole d'une écriture féminine émancipée et l'insistance sur le classicisme de l'écriture et de l'œuvre yourcenariennes. Néanmoins, le problème essentiel engendré par la sortie de Mémoires d'Hadrien concerne la question du genre qui différencie de manière nette les critiques des années cinquante des interprétations les plus récentes. La gêne initiale, due à la forme ambiguë de cette autobiographie fictive, deviendra par la suite l'élément novateur des Mémoires.<br>

Abstract: On propose ici une analyse de la structure narrative du Saint Louis de Jacques Le Goff, de ses « trois drames » dont la succession (le troisième recomposant ce que le deuxième avait démonté du premier) crée l'effet de lecture. Celui-ci est, en particulier, animé par le retour des mêmes histoires, parfois des mêmes textes, sur lesquels l'historien exerce sa critique, patiemment et modestement, nous délivrant au passage une leçon de méthode. Peut-on lire un livre d'histoire comme un roman ? C'est la question que cet essai tente de poser, en même temps qu'il revient sur l'ambiguïté de son « personnage », Saint Louis qui fut peut-être, comme le Genet de Sartre, comédien et martyr. Proposed here is an analysis of the narrative structure of Jacques Le Goff's Saint Louis, of the « three dramas » which create, by their succession (the third drama recomposes what the second had deconstructed of the first), the effectiveness of its readability. This is particularly animated by the recurrence of the same stories, sometimes of the same texts, to which the author applies his criticism, with patience and humility, delivering to us in the process a lesson in methodology. Can a history book be read like a novel ? That is the question which this essay addresses, at the same time as it reverts to the ambiguity of its « personage » - Saint Louis -, who was perhaps, like Sartre's Genet, a comedian and a martyr.<br>

Author(s): MALHERBE Jean-François<br>
Abstract: Dans le prolongement de la philosophie de Wittgenstein, les contributions récentes de Quine et de Searle invitent à modifier la manière de poser la question de la signification des termes théoriques : ne faudrait-il pas substituer à une préoccupation principalement ontologique (que désignent les termes théoriques ?) un souci plus praxéologique (quel rôle les termes théoriques tiennent-ils dans l'articulation des discours et des pratiques scientifiques ?). C'est ce renversement qu'il s'agit d'opérer ici. Starting from the philosophy of Wittgenstein, more recent works of Quine and Searle are presented. This reflexion leads to a modification of the way of considering the meaning of theoretical terms. It is suggested that, in place of a mainly ontological point of view (what is the reference of theoretical terms), a more praxeological point of view is more appropriate (which is the use of theoretical terms for the building of sciences and for scientific work). The goal of this article is to consider this change of perspective.<br>

La question de savoir si de l'existence d'une bijection entre deux ensembles, on peut conclure à leur équipotence, aboutit à une impasse : quelle que soit la réponse donnée, ses conséquences sont absurdes. This paper presents an unpublished note by Bolzano, which surveys the various difficulties linked to the notion of infinity. This note, written in 1813-1814, is an excerpt from his mathematical diaries, Miscellanea mathematica. Raising the question whether one may deduce the equivalence of two sets from the existence of a bijective correlation between them, ends in a blind alley : from every possible answer, absurd consequences follow.<br>

Abstract: A l'opposé des discours philosophiques contemporains, la Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) d'Éric Weil reprend pour l'essentiel l'idée kantienne de la loi morale. Mais elle déplace la problématique de la fondation en procédant selon la méthode de l'« analyse génétique » qui concilie « développement phénoménologique » et « exposé encyclopédique ». Le chemin des apories de la réflexion morale conduit à la conscience de soi philosophique de la question morale comme question, et comme question irréductible, c'est-à-dire comme question que se pose une liberté qui a déjà, sans raison, choisi la raison. Contrary to the contemporary philosophical discourses, E. Weil's Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) resumes in his essential part the kantian idea of the moral law. But E. Weil displaces the problem of foundation, proceeding by the method of « genetical analysis » which conciliates « phenomenological development » and « encyclopaedic exposition » . The way of the apories of the moral reflexion leads into the philosophical self-consciousness of the moral question as a question, and as an irreducible question, in other words as a question stated to a freedom which has, without reason, already chosen the reason.<br>

Author(s): GREISCH JEAN<br>
Abstract: L'article dessine une ellipse à deux foyers que toute tentative dépenser la religion avec les moyens de la philosophie devra parcourir. Le premier pôle est occupé par le concept de « religion », le second par la pluralité irréductible des religions historiques. Selon qu'on se place dans l'optique de la « religion naturelle », ou dans celle de la « philosophie de la religion », cette ellipse revêtira une allure différente. Publiés il y a deux siècles, les Discours sur la religion de Friedrich Schleiermacher sont une des premières tentatives d'aborder cette ellipse dans l'optique d'une philosophie de la religion. L'originalité de cette approche prend encore plus de relief si on la compare avec la tentative kantienne de déployer les représentations, les croyances et les institutions religieuses sous l'égide de la question : « Que m'est-il permis d'espérer ? ». Autant les thèses que Schleiermacher défend dans le deuxième et le cinquième Discours gardent une grande actualité, autant son analyse du judaïsme atteste la difficulté de conjuguer un éloge de la pluralité avec une pensée de l'altérité. The article sketches a bifocal model which any attempt to give a philosophical meaning to the difference of religions must keep in mind. The first focus expresses the necessity of a concept of religion as such, the second deals with the irreducible difference and plurality of positive religions. This tension has a different shape if it is analysed through the pattern of « natural religion » or the pattern of philosophy of religion. Two centuries ago, Friedrich Schleiermacher's Reden über die Religion give us an excellent example of the second approach. Its originality can be higlightened, if we compare Schleiermacher's thesis in the second and the fith discourse, with Kant's attempt to develop a philosophical understanding of religious representations, beliefs and institutions in the light of the question : « What may hope ? ».

Abstract: Dans la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, les principaux aspects de la définition et de la compréhension « aristotélicienne » de la métaphore ont été mis en question: théorie de la substitution, teleologie de l'univocité, subordination de la métaphore à la connaissance, et jusqu'à la centralité même conférée à la métaphore aux dépens d'autres figures (métonymie, synecdoque, catachrèse. .. ). Dans cet article, nous tentons de résumer et de discuter les points essentiels de cette contestation multiforme, en nous attachant particulièrement à la déconstruction derridienne de la métaphore « dans le texte philosophique » et à la synthèse, par Ricoeur, de la « nouvelle » théorie de la métaphore. In the second half of the twentieth century, the main aspects of the « aristotelian » definition and understanding of metaphor have been questioned : substitution-theory, teleology of univocity, subordination of metaphor to knowledge, and the very centrality attributed to metaphor at the expense of other tropes (metonymy, synecdoque, catachresis...). In this paper, we try to summarize and discuss various aspects of this dispute, paying special attention to Derrida's deconstruction of metaphor « in the philosophical text » and to Ricoeur's synthesis of the « new » theory of metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte a pour objet de montrer que le moment de la « refiguration » dans Temps et récit est indissociable d'un souci éthique. La fonction narrative a des implications éthiques car le récit — et particulièrement le récit d'une (ou des) vie(s) — constitue un point de passage: il pose la question de la communicabilité ou de l'échange des expériences. D'où la difficulté que Ricœur a lui-même affrontée: qu'en est-il des vies qui ne trouvent pas de narrateur? My aim is to bring to light how « refiguration » — as analysed in Time and Narrative — is strongly linked to an ethical care. Narrative function has ethical consequences because Narrative of a life (or of several Ufes) is a way to communicability and exchange of experiences. That is the raison why Ricœur himself confronted the difficulty: what about Ufes deprived of Narrative?<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: In a first part, the article tells the story of the Hermeneutics Group of the NTSSA. It is a story with three phases. In the first phase, interpretation was seen as more than the application of methods. In the second phase, the active role of the reader became more important. In the third phase, the importance of interpretive communities became more apparent. In a second part, some of the issues resulting from these developments are discussed under the rubric 'Why do we interpret the New Testament?' In a third part, the question is raised whether the Hermeneutics Group (and the NTSSA?) may be entering a new phase in its scholarly activity of dialogue with other reader-communities.<br>

Abstract: At Malmö School of Education a project team has tried to find out to what extent people are capable of constructing and presenting historical stories. The practical approach has dominated the project. Participants have been a lot of teacher students and a dozen experienced history teachers at schools in the south of Sweden. The main purpose has been to create teacher-stories for classroom use. To a minor extent we also have examined what narrative competence teenagers can develop. We tried to answer these questions: Is it easy or difficult to create and tell stories that are 1) chronological, 2) true, and 3) meaningful? Our results — more empirically than scientifically based — are: 1) Not only teachers but also pupils can create chronologic presentations. 2) We found some problems when we tried to follow the truth criterion. Story-tellers found it difficult to construct good stories if being limited to use only true elements of the past (found for example in historical dissertations). 3) The biggest problems we met were when we tried to make meaningful stories out of our true stories. Narrative history probably is worth a renaissance. However, much work remains before we know the best ways to develop narrative competence. An der „School of Education“ von Malmö hat ein Forscherteam den Versuch unternommen herauszufinden, bis zu welchem Grad Menschen fähig sind, historische Geschichten zu entwickeln und zu erzählen. Ein praktischer Zugang bestimmte das Projekt. Eine Anzahl Lehramtsstudenten und ein Dutzend erfahrener Geschichtslehrer an Schulen Südschwedens nahmen an diesem Projekt teil. Das Hauptziel war, Geschichten für Lehrer zur Verwendung im Geschichtsunterricht auszuarbeiten. In zweiter Linie ging es darum zu untersuchen, welche narrative Kompetenz Jugendliche entwickeln können. Wir haben versucht, folgende Fragen zu beantworten: Ist es leicht oder schwierig, Geschichten zu schaffen und zu erzählen, die 1. chronologisch, 2. wahr und 3. sinnvoll sind? Unsere Erg~<br>

Abstract: The author of the article in question reports on a study analysing how 15 year-old French lycée pupils interpret school texts about the representation of the Norman kings of Sicily in the 12th century, the latter of whom allowed themselves to be portrayed both as Byzantine emperors and as Muslim caliphs. Ever since Moscovic's theory of social representation, we know that people make sense of specialized knowledge (in this case, historical knowledge) by converting it into "naïve", everyday knowledge. As pupils generally cannot explain the political intentions of the kings of Sicily, the lycée pupils were asked – as part of the study – to deal with the assertions of a paper (written by another pupil) that compared the Norman kingdom of Sicily and the situation of Maghrebine immigrants in presentday France. The study takes a closer look at how the learners, in the course of the "spiral-shaped" learning process, first acquired a "naïve" picture of the kings of Sicily, only later to distance themselves from their original thoughts in order to be able to make sense of their school texts. Der Autor des vorliegenden Artikels berichtet über eine Untersuchung, die analysiert, wie 15-jährige französische Gymnasiasten Schulmaterialen über die Repräsentationen der normannischen Könige von Sizilien im 12. Jahrhundert interpretieren. Letztere ließen sich sowohl als byzantinische Kaiser wie auch als muslimische Kalifen darstellen. Seit Moscovicis Theorie der sozialen Repräsentationen wissen wir, dass Menschen Fachwissen (hier historischem Wissen) einen Sinn geben, indem sie es in ein „naives" Alltagswissen verwandeln. Da Schüler im Allgemeinen die politischen Intentionen der Könige von Sizilien nicht erklären können, wurden im Rahmen dieser Untersuchung Gymnasiasten aufgefordert, sich mit einer schriftlichen Schülerarbeit zu befassen, die das normannische Königreich von Sizilien und die Situation maghrebinischer Einwanderer im heutigen Frankreich vergleicht. Es wurde näher betracht~<br>

Abstract: The different "readings and readers" are evaluated, with a view to responsible hermeneutics, on three levels. First, the question is asked as to whether the different readings took place in a responsible way in terms of their own presuppositions and goals. Some general remarks are made on the possible comparison and integration of these readings are made. Second, the question is asked whether some of these readings are more appropriate, responsible or legitimate readings of literature than others. The point is argued that such an evaluation cannot be timeless and abstract, but will depend on the purpose of the reader. Third, the question is asked how the specific pencope, namely a text from the Christian New Testament, can be responsibly read by New Testament scholars.<br>

Abstract: This study, based largely on unpublished material, is an attempt to describe and evaluate how French Protestantism dealt with the German question in the postwar period. A short description of the perception of Germany by French Protestants towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century underlines the new approach which characterized the relations between French and German Protestants after the Second World War. In spite of the shattering defeat of the Third Reich, Germany remained in the eyes of many French Protestants a dreadful danger. However, already shortly after the war, some clergymen and laymen, many of whom had been involved in the resistance against the nazi regime, believed that their mission was to act as mediators and peacemakers despite the official hard-line diplomacy of their country. This article provides a selection of quotations of French Protestants' intentions and conceptions regarding the German question, as well as examining the ways and means they thought best to prevent Germany from becoming a new danger to France and Europe. It shows how seriously they debated all aspects of a common future with yesterday's enemy in a Europe of tomorrow, and affords an insight into how some Protestant personalities on both sides of the Rhine played an important role in the process of Franco-German reconciliation during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: L'article identifie une tension dans la représentation hayékienne des règles de droit. Alors qu'elles jouent une fonction essentielle dans la coordination au sein de l'ordre spontané en définissant les attentes légitimes des agents, Hayek ne développe pas réellement les mécanismes par lesquels émerge une interprétation partagée des règles. D'abord, les fonctions des règles de droit au sein de l'ordre spontané sont présentées. Puis nous montrons que les règles sont constituées par les attentes que les agents forment à leur propos. Enfin, nous montrons qu'aucun des deux mécanismes proposés par Hayek -le sens de la justice et le juge -n'est capable de garantir la résolution des conflits d'interprétation entre les individus. De tels conflits mettent en question l'efficacité et la justice de l'ordre spontané. The article focuses on a tension in the Hayekian representation of legal rules. While rules perform an essential function of coordination by providing common interpretation about the legitimate expectations, Hayek does not really develop the mechanisms by which common interpretations may emerge. Firstly, the functions of coordination of rules are presented. We show then that rules are constituted by individual meanings. Finally we show none of the two mechanisms producing shared interpretations, the sense of justice and the judge, is able to guarantee the resolution of conflicts of interpretation between individuals. Such a conflict questions therefore spontaneous order's efficiency and justice.<br>

Abstract: Comme n'importe quel éditeur scientifique, l'économiste qui entend diffuser les écrits de ses prédécesseurs est confronté à une problématique invariable : publier quoi et comment, par delà le choix de qui. Les difficultés posées par cette problématique, dans le champ de notre discipline, ne se distinguent pas radicalement de celles qui interviennent dans d'autres domaines, y compris en littérature. Certes, le traitement de ces difficultés mobilise à de nombreux égards des compétences qui ne sont habituellement pas l'apanage de l'historien de la pensée économique, mais il requiert aussi des capacités analytiques que ce dernier a coutume de reconnaître comme les siennes propres. Il demeure que l'activité editoriale est une pratique savante à laquelle l'historien de la pensée économique n'accorde ordinairement que peu d'attention. Pourtant, puisque la littérature primaire dont s'alimente notre discipline est ici en jeu, l'affirmation institutionnelle et la diffusion de celle-ci dépendent d'une telle pratique. Like any other scientific editor, the economist who intends to spread the writings of his predecessors is faced with constant problems, beyond the question of who he will publish: what he should publish and how he should publish it. In the field of our discipline, the difficulties raised by these questions are not radically different from those which occur in other disciplines, including literature. Of course, in many respects dealing with these difficulties implies skills which are not usually the prerogative of the historian of economic thought. Nevertheless it also requires analytical abilities that the latter is in the habit of regarding as being his own. The fact remains that editing is a scholarly practice to which the historian of economic thought usually pays little attention. However, since the primary source materials that continue to be the foundation for research in our academic discipline are here at stake, its institutional recognition and spread dep~<br>

Abstract: Que veut-on dire lorsqu'on parle aujourd'hui de valeur de travail ? Une libre réflexion de philosophie économique sur la notion de valeur et sur sa famille - valeur absolue, valeur relative, valeur d'usage, valeur d'échange, évaluation, valorisation, etc. tente d'apporter ici une réponse. Avec, pour exemple privilégié, la doctrine de Marx sur le travail dans le capitalisme et dans la société communiste. What do we mean when we speak about the value of work? This article tries to provide an answer to this question by analysing the notions of value and its different forms: absolute and relative value, use value and exchange value, evaluation and the creation of value. It draws especially on Marx's doctrine of work in capitalism and the communist society.<br>

Abstract: A rebours de l'illusion rétrospective qui tend à ancrer le totalitarisme comme abolition de la démocratie dans le phénomène révolutionnaire lui-même, l'œuvre de Rosa Luxemburg se caractérise par l'exigence jamais abandonnée d'articuler révolution et démocratie. La révolution (dont la théorie apparaît dans Grève de masses, parti et syndicat) est chez elle la redécouverte par les masses de l'action politique : c'est ainsi qu'à partir de certaines catégories de pensée arendtienne on peut interpréter la notion de spontanéité, laquelle est auto-organisation et non violence. De plus, Rosa Luxemburg ne cessera de considérer comme essentielle la question de la forme de régime politique appropriée au pouvoir du peuple (d'où ses critiques adressées à la Révolution russe), s'inscrivant en faux contre la notion de « démocratie bourgeoise ». Refusant toute conception de l'action politique comme fabrication, commandement ou stratégie militaire, il y a chez elle une théorie de l'organisation politique d'inspiration machiavélienne, dont l'action est vue comme une intervention dans le présent et la contingence. Cette contingence reste toutefois inscrite dans le cadre fixé par Marx qui fait du conflit de classe la substance de l'action politique. Contrary to the retrospective illusion which tends to locate totalitarianism as abolition of democracy in the revolutionary phenomenon itself, Rosa Luxemburg's work is characterized by the ever present requirement to join revolution and democracy. Revolution (the theory of which appears in Mass strikes, parties and unions) is the masses' rediscovery of political action; one can thus, using certain categories of Arendt's thought, interpret the concept of spontaneity as self organization rather than violence. Moreover, Rosa Luxemburg never ceased considering as essential the issue of the form of political regime appropriate for popular power (which explains her criticism of the Russian revolution), and was opposed to the concept of "bourgeois ~<br>

Abstract: À partir de plusieurs vagues d'enquêtes par entretiens approfondis, cet article s'efforce de montrer ce que le rapport au politique, notamment l'investissement dans les objets politiques et les préférences que l'on peut avoir ou ne pas avoir dans ces domaines, doivent aux diverses socialisations constitutives de l'expérience du monde social d'un individu. Il exemplifie la manière dont chacun s'appuie sur des visions et valorisations du monde élaborées à travers son histoire sociale personnelle pour appréhender les questions politiques. Au-delà de la description des instruments cognitifs mobilisés dans des situations, il s'agit d'expliquer les conditions de l'adhésion aux représentations et les facteurs de l'activation de leurs ressources cognitives. Ce travail est aussi l'occasion d'élargir les problématiques des travaux touchant à la socialisation politique et de questionner certains de leurs résultats. L'enjeu théorique est de dépasser les dualismes — explication versus compréhension, objectivisme et subjectivisme, déterminisme et liberté, intérêts et croyances, holisme et individualisme, méthodes quantitatives et qualitatives — qui structurent et bornent trop souvent les recherches des sciences sociales. Using several series of in depth interviews, this article shows what the relationship to politics, particularly the investment in political objects and one's preferences in these areas, owe to the various socializations that make up the experience of the social world of an individual. It exemplifies how people depend on visions and outlooks of the world worked out through their personal social history to grasp political questions. Beyond describing the cognitive instruments mobilized in these situations, there is the question of explaining the conditions for accepting these representations and the factors of the activation of their cognitive resources. This is also the opportunity to widen the problematics of researches touching upon political socialization and t~<br>

Abstract: The article explores how, given the absence of a proper public sphere, twentieth-century Hungarian social research began to use the notion of "reality" in populist socio-reports, the documentary films of the 1970s, and sociological debates. These discussions all shared the assumption that contemporary political elites ignored the "real" conditions of society. Thus it was the duty of social research (socio-reports or sociology proper) to reveal these facts in a manner that was free of ideology. Whereas in North America and Western Europe during the 1960s and 1970s the notion of a directly accessible "reality" had been thrown into question, in Hungary scholarship insisted on this kind of cognitive realism because of social and political reasons. As they argued, "reality" was to be interpreted not as a universal epistemological category, but according to particular terms of the sociology of knowledge. This article explores how the detection of "reality" and "facts" became an ethical vocation within these interrogatory frameworks.<br>

Publisher: Institut d'études Slaves<br>
Issue: i40129177<br>

Author(s): LANDRY TRISTAN<br>
Abstract: From the very beginning of his career as a writer, Nikolay Ostrovsky (1904-36) received hostile criticisms of his style, which was described as 'coarse,' and which led some observers to conclude that his success was due more to his prowess as a soldier than to his talents as a writer. But his success was incontrovertible. Readers rushed to buy his book How the Steel Was Tempered, despite the absence of publicity when it appeared. What accounts for the extraordinary success? Readers' letters contained in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI) can help us answer this question. Over the past ten years there have been many studies in which scholars have sought the organizational basis of socialist realism as an esthetic, putting the literariness of the work before its political character. It certainly seems logical, since esthetics is not just a question of production but also of consumption (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), that this program of research should also include the acceptance of the texts, their reception by the readers. Сначала своей писательской карьеры, Николай Островский (1904-1936) получил строгие критики за свой стиль, который был описан как «груб» и некоторые наблюдатели считали, что успех его был обязан больше его подвигам в качестве солдата чем его талантам писателя. Но успех был бесспорен. Читатели устремлялись чтобы покупать книгу, Как закалялась сталь, несмотря на отсутствие рекламной шумихи во время ее публикации. Что может объяснить этот чрезвычайный успех? Письма читателей, содержавшиеся в Государственных архивах искусства и литературы Федерации России (RGALI) могут нам помочь отвечать на этот вопрос. В течение последних десяти лет, многочисленные публикации показали структуру социалистического реализма, как эстетика, помещающая литературность произведения перед его политическим характером. Потому что эстетика не только вопрос продукции а также потребления (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), кажется логическим, чтобы эта исследовательская программа ~<br>

Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i40132217<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Conan Michel<br>
Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Abstract: This article with various models of relation between science and belief. The first part of paper discusses all theories which affirm an opposition between science and religious belief: some of the speak about a real and durable contradiction (logical empirism, marxism), another speak only about linguistic opposition (fideism, cryptofideism, theory of double truth). All these theories are controversial because they call in question the noetic value of religion or of science. The second part of the paper considers the theories affirming concordance between science and belief. They are following: the distinction of man's existential attitude toward religion and science (so-colled II. Wittgenstein), the theory of concordance, complementary character of science and belief, the theory of methodologie difference and of object's diversity. The author came do the conclusion that the best explication of the relation between science and religion is given by the synthetic-complementary theory.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Abstract: In the past decades the concept of recognition has moved to the center of social theory. Can this concept be of use for American Studies and, more specifically, American literary and cultural studies? My essay tries to answer this question in five parts: first, a discussion of two opposite views of the social and cultural role of recognition exemplified by Charles Taylor and Alexis de Tocqueville; second, a reconsideration of the concept of identity, since recognition is inextricably linked with questions of identity formation in current debates; third, a description of the ways in which the struggle for recognition stands at the center of fictional texts and forms an imaginary core that has often been forgotten in the professionalization of literary studies; fourth, an analysis of how recognition can be understood and described as an effect of the reading experience (and of aesthetic experience more generally); and fifth, a return to the starting question of this essay, namely what the concept of recognition can contribute to American Studies and how it can be assessed in comparison with other, currently dominant approaches in the field.<br>

Abstract: Penelope Fitzgerald's first novel The Golden Child is often considered apart from her subsequent novels, mainly because it is detective fiction. Though her uncle, Father Ronald Knox, was a well-respected master of this genre, Fitzgerald came to it with certain misgivings, which were especially pronounced when she considered its limitations against the achievements of modern fiction. However, those elements of the detective genre that may be found in The Golden Child did, along with the underlying interest in the question of authority, carry forward into her own more modern achievements in the novel.<br>

Abstract: According to German criminal law, a person who violates a criminal law rule will be excused under the conditions of § 35 German Criminal Code (necessity as an excuse). What are the reasons for not holding an offender responsible in these cases although he may have even caused the death of his victim? In section II of this essay, the usual answers to this question are analysed. The result is that none of them is utterly convincing. They all have in common that they underestimate the importance of the victim's interest in his personal freedom. In section III, the author puts forward his own interpretation of § 35 German Criminal Code. This interpretation is based on the distinction between two meanings of legal freedom. In the first place the members of a legal community are obliged to respect the „negative freedom“ of each other. On the basis of this understanding of „freedom“ the defence of necessity appears as an alien element within the system of criminal law. However, the status of the members of a legal community is not confined to their „negative freedom.“ To some extent, the criminal law also recognizes their „positive freedom“: the interest of each individual to preserve his personal integrity. The defence of necessity in § 35 German Criminal Code can be interpreted as acknowledging the offender's „positive freedom.“ In the final section of this essay (section IV) this model of explanation is applied to a range of detailed problems raised by § 35 German Criminal Code.<br>

Abstract: Dans la Vie d'Apollonios de Tyane, Philostrate construit, au moment de la rencontre entre son protagoniste et Iarchas, le chef des brahmanes, un dialogue dans lequel autorité et charisme sont essentiels. Cette mise en scène l'autorise ensuite à produire un discours concernant la domination romaine et ses représentants, à destination des Grecs comme des Romains. La question du destinataire permet de mettre en lumière certains des enjeux les plus fondamentaux de l'œuvre du sophiste. Elle montre de quelle manière Philostrate interroge les Hellènes sur leurs choix de vie et leur identité dans le monde gréco-romain du début du IIIe siècle. In the Life of Appolonios of Tyana, Philostratos builds up, when his protagonist meets larchas, the chief of the Brahmins, a dialogue in which authority and charisma are essential. That staging allows him to produce a speech concerning Roman sway an dits representatives, addressing Greeks and Romans alike. The question of addressee enables him to highlight some of the more fundamental point at stake in the sophist's work. It shows in what way Philostratos questions the Greeks about their life choices and their identity in the Greco-Roman worlf at the beginning of the IIIrd century.<br>

Publisher: Duncker & Humblot<br>
Issue: i40145734<br>
Date: 1 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Maschke Günter<br>
Abstract: The author uses the term "banalité supérieure" to describe Schmitt's somewhat shocking thesis that the true political distinction is the one between "friend" (Freund) and "enemy" (Feind). To be sure, this perception does not free one from the necessity of continually determining a new the concrete friend-enemy relationship. Using the more recent literature from Italy, France, Spain and Germany, the discussion centers around the question whether Schmitt had several political terms which he himself often used and combined in different ways. The author demonstrates the fruitfulness of the etymological and philosophical study of the words "friend" and "enemy". At the same time, he presents the thesis that "friend" is also a political term and, as such, remains connected to "enemy". Hence, it is not important whether a political theory accentuates the "friend" or the "enemy". The criticism that Schmitt's anthropology is incomplete is rejected. As the classic authors have shown, it is sufficient that a political theory appreciates the value of experience. Experience confirms, however, the existence of danger and evil in human nature. Nevertheless, danger and evil may not be regarded as identical; political theory and' theology must remain separate. In conclusion, the author rebuffs the allegation that Schmitt was interested in the destruction of the Weimar Republic.<br>

Abstract: Au lieu de soi marque un Haut Lieu du soi. Dans cette perspective, la hauteur du sujet s'acquiert par la verticalité (transcendance), et non pas uniquement par l'horizontalité (immanence). Interrogeant l'ambition d'une approche de saint Augustin du point de vue de saint Augustin lui-même, on montrera d'abord le mérite d'un tel renouvellement dans le cadre de la philosophie comme telle : la question de l'homme, le poids du soi, et le statut de l'èros. Une noble « disputatio théologique et phénoménologique » cependant naîtra dans la confrontation avec d'autres ouvrages (en particulier Dieu, la chair et l'autre. D'Irénée à Duns Scot [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]) : doit-on nécessairement « dépasser » la métaphysique dans un tiers ordre, ou ne convient-il pas plutôt de la « transformer de l'intérieur » dans le geste que semble avoir accompli le Docteur d'Hippone lui-même ? Il en va ici du statut de la philosophie dans son rapport ci la métaphysique et à la théologie, mais aussi de la possibilité d'une « nouvelle pratique phénoménologique de la philosophie médiévale », pour aujourd'hui comme pour demain. In Place of the Self marks what we might call a « high point of the self ». From this exalted perspective the measure of the subject is taken in its verticality (transcendence) and not simply its horizontality (immanence). Jean-Luc Marion approaches St. Augustine from the point of view of St. Augustine himself, and in this article I show first the merit of such an approach within a philosophical framework, its relevance to topics such as the question of man, the burden of the self and the status of eros. A significant « theological and phenomenological disputatio » does, however, arise when In Place of the Self is put up against other works (in particular against God, the Flesh and the Other : from Irenaeus to Duns Scotus [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]). Do we have to « overcome » metaphysics by moving to another order of analysis ? Is it not better to work from the inside, i~<br>

Abstract: A partir de una visión de la moneda que toma en cuenta su función simbólica primera —la de la representación de la totalidad social—, este artículo analiza la relación entre legitimidad política y el régimen monetario, puesta en escena por el paso de las altas inflaciones a la deflación en América Latina. En esta perspectiva se reconsideran los problemas de sustentabilidad de las políticas monetarias, y se establece que las mismas plantean más en América Latina que en Europa, el problema de la relación entre las soberanías política y monetaria. La interrogación se remite así al futuro posible del Mercosur: ¿se enredará en la discusión comercial o será motivo de emprender una deliberación política sobre la reorganización territorial y el marco institucional que sostendrían un crecimiento en economía abierta impulsado por el empleo y la demanda? On the basis of a view of currency that considers its initial symbolic function— that of the representation of social totality— the text analyzes the relationship between political legitimacy and monetary regime, caused by the shift from high inflation to deflation in Latin America. The problems of the sustainability of monetary policies are considered from this point of view, and the author suggests that, even more so in Latin America than in Europe, these policies raise the problem of the relationship between political and monetary sovereignty. The question leads one to the possible future of Mercosur: will it become enmeshed in trade discussions or will it lead to a political discussion on territorial reorganization and the institutional framework that would support growth in an open economy driven by employment and demand? À partir d'une vision de la monnaie qui prend en compte sa fonction symbolique première celle de la représentation de la totalité sociale, on analyse dans ce texte la relation entre légitimité politique et régime monétaire, relation mise en scène par le passage, en Amérique latine, de l'inflation galopan~<br>

Author(s): TodorovAbstract: Rapidement, derrière la réclamation de la réparation morale des crimes contre l'humanité que constituent la traite négrière et l'esclavage dans les colonies françaises durant deux siècles, pointent des revendications de réparations matérielles de ces crimes. À l'inverse de ladite réparation, ces revendications paraissent n'avoir que très peu de possibilité d'être effectivement satisfaites et ne présenter qu'une faible légitimité à l'être. Et ce, principalement, parmi d'autres facteurs, du fait de l'éloignement dans le temps des crimes en question. C'est que s'il est vrai que bien des inégalités que connaissent les peuples des départements français d'Outre-mer portent encore la marque de l'oppression esclavagiste passée, il n'est pas moins certain qu'elles ne sont pas à combattre en fonction du passé, mais relativement a des dominations présentes. /// Quite soon, following in the tracks of a demand for a moral reparation of two centuries of slavery and slave trade in France's colonies, claims have been made for material reparations of these crimes against humanity. Unlike the first demand, these claims have very few chances of actually being satisfied and are apparently lacking in justification, mainly because, among others factors, these crimes lie in a distant past. Although many of the inequalities experienced by the inhabitants of the French overseas departments still bear the marks of slavery, it is no less true that the struggle against inequality is not to be led as a function of the past but, instead, in relation to present-day domination.<br>

Abstract: Pour expliquer le suicide des agriculteurs, les médias se limitent généralement au seul facteur économique. Une approche comprehensive de cette question révèle d'autres conditions objectives de production de ce qu'on peut appeler la « souffrance sociale ». Le déséquilibre structurel entre l'organisation prescrite et l'organisation réelle du travail génère chez les agriculteurs un sentiment de pénibilité mentale. Tenus de répondre à des impératifs d'autonomie et de réalisation de soi, ces derniers ne disposent pas tous des mêmes ressources sociales pour parvenir à une image positive d'eux-mêmes. Pour se développer, la souffrance suicidaire s'appuie en effet sur la distribution inégale du capital économique, culturel et d'autochtonie. When explaining suicide among farmers, the media tend to focus exclusively on economic factors. This paper argues that adopting a more comprehensive approach to the issue highlights other conditions of production of what might be termed "social suffering". It is suggested that the structural imbalance between the prescribed and actual organization of work causes mental pain among farmers. The paper argues that amid increasing pressure to demonstrate greater autonomy and self-realization, farmers may not have the same social resources for developing a positive self-image. Research shows that an unequal distribution of economic and cultural capital and capital of autochtony leads to increased suicidal thoughts.<br>

Abstract: L'impératif de tolérance se fait entendre chaque jour davantage. Certains de ses apôtres se réclament de Hannah Arendt. C'est pourquoi, et afin de pouvoir répondre à la question : Revenons-nous à une société d'intolérance ?, en prenant la mesure du réel, il m'a semblé utile de confronter leurs discours à sa pensée. Alain Finkielkraut, qui reconnaît volontiers qu' « il y a une vraie difficulté aujourd'hui parce que les mots mêmes de notre grande tradition politique sont réinvestis par le multiculturalisme et complètement dévoyés de leur sens », a bien voulu m'y aider grâce à cette conversation amicale que nous vom proposons. Souvent soumise à une approche morale, la tolérance sera ainsi mise ici à l'épreuve de la conception arendtienne du politique.<br>

De nombreux auteurs s'interrogent sur la signification des relectures et des retouches successives. Ainsi, l'ouvrage rejoint l'aspect le plus énigmatique du corpus johannique (évangile et épîtres). Les écrits johanniques ont été dès l'origine et demeurent au centre de conflits d'interprétations; de ces conflits, comme des hypothèses les plus diverses, le livre a le mérite de rendre compte. Ainsi, il se montre digne de figurer parmi les ouvrages de référence sur ce sujet. This collection, the work of fifteen exegetes and edited by Kaestli, Poffet and Zumstein, presents a panorama of contemporary Johannine research for the benefit of the larger public. Touching upon many themes, it introduces the reader to the unresolved questions concerning the Johannine communities and their literature. Several authors question the significance of rereadings and successive alterations, the most enigmatic aspect of the Johannine corpus (gospel and epistles). The collection has the merit of presenting the diverse hypothesis and conflicts of interpretation to which Johannine writings have always been exposed, and should figure amongst the works of reference on the subject.<br>

Abstract: S'inspirant de travaux menés à l'Institut de recherches herméneutiques et systématiques de Neuchâtel, l'article esquisse quelques implications résultant d'une approche herméneutique du dialogue entre science et foi. Partant de l'extension du phénomène de l'interprétation, il réfléchit aux conditions du travail interdisciplinaire et à l'accent interactionnel qui en résulte. Il aborde ensuite la question d'un tiers d'ancrage pour science et foi, ce qui le conduit à une réflexion sur la dialectique entre Ecriture et expérience. Inspired by recent work at the Research institute of hermeneutics and systematics in Neuchatel, this article delineates some implications of a hermeneutical approach to the dialogue between science and faith. From the enlargment of the import of interpretation, it goes on to discuss the prerequisites of interdisciplinary work and the resultant interactional emphasis. Interaction requires a common grounding, an anchorage outside both science and faith. As experience, this leads the theologian to the challenge of the dialectic between Scripture and experience.<br>

Abstract: Ouvrage de référence imposant et important, l'Encyclopédie du protestantisme offre des outils d'analyse et de connaissance de la tradition protestante. Venant à la suite de nombreuses autres lectures critiques, la présente étude aborde le projet dans son ensemble avant de parcourir les petites rubriques puis les grands dossiers. A chaque niveau sont alliés la présentation et le regard critique. L'étude se termine par la question centrale de l'ouvrage, celle de l'identité protestante. An imposing and important reference book, the Enyclopédie du protestantisme offers tools for analysing and understanding the protestant tradition. Coming after numerous other critical studies, it begins with an overall view before presenting smaller headings followed by the greater issues. At every level exposition is aligned with criticism. The study ends with the central question of the book, that of Protestant identity.<br>

Abstract: La confrontation théologique à la critique du christianisme contenue dans l'œuvre du Marquis de Sade n'est pas encore habituelle. Ces pages offrent donc une entrée dans la réflexion qui peut naître d'une telle confrontation. L'article se divise en sept paragraphes qui reprennent les grandes lignes de mon travail théologique inspiré par la pensée de Sade. La question du mal semble être au centre de ce dialogue. C'est autour de notions telles que le péché, la responsabilité, la culpabilité ou le mal radical que s'articule l'argumentation. The theological confrontation with the criticism of Christianity contained in the work of Marquis de Sade is not yet common. These pages offer a point of entry into reflection which can originate from such a confrontation. The article is divided into seven paragraphs based on the main lines of my theological work inspired by the thought of Sade. The problem of evil seems to be at the centre of this dialogue. The argument develops around such notions as sin, responsability, guilt and radical evil.<br>

Abstract: Jean-Paul II, dans son encyclique Ut unum sint, situe l'œcuménisme dans une double relation ascendante et descendante: d'une part relation de l'homme à Dieu et d'autre part relation de l'homme au monde. Ces deux mouvements doivent passer par la grille critique de la vérité et de l'amour pour être efficients, ce qui correspond à la Révélation comme mouvement premier de Dieu vers l'homme. Ainsi, le dialogue œcuménique ne pourra éviter une réflexion sur le statut de la vérité et de l'amour dans leur gestion ecclésiale, réflexion menée à la lumière de la polarité christologico-pneumatologique. Symptomatiquement, la question du ministère papal montre les impasses actuelles et les ouvertures possibles. John-Paul II, in his encyclical Ut unum sint, situates ecumenism in a twofold relationship, ascending and descending: the relationship of humankind to God and of humankind to the world. To be dynamic, these two movements must pass through the critical grid of truth and love, which corresponds to revelation as the first movement of God to humans. Thus ecumenical dialogue cannot avoid a reflection of the status of truth and love in ecclesiastic management, in the light of Christo-pneumatological polarity. Symptomatically, the question of papal ministry shows existing dead ends and possible apertures.<br>

Abstract: Contrairement à certains préjugés laïcistes radicaux, la question de Dieu est au cœur de l'éthique. Or les débats actuels de la bioéthique ne permettent pas toujours d'identifier clairement la pertinence de cette question. Afin de parvenir à une reformulation crédible de la contribution de l'éthique théologique à la discussion publique, il importe d'interroger les différentes manières de comprendre la relation entre les catégories d'immanence et de transcendance. En dialogue critique avec H. Tristram Engelhardt, l'auteur balise les conditions fondamentales d'accès à une interprétation de Dieu comme mystère du monde et de l'existence et donc aussi comme horizon indépassable de toute éthique. Contrary to certain radical lay prejudices, the question of God is at the heart of ethics. Yet current debates on bioethics do not always help to clearly identify the pertinence of the question. To reformulate the contribution of theological ethics to public discussion in a credible way, we must examine the different ways of understanding the relationship between immanence and transcendance. In critical dialogue with H. Tristram Engelhardt, the author marks out the basic conditions to access an interpretation of God as mystery of the world and of existance, thus also as the impassable horizon of all ethics.<br>

Abstract: La transition vers l'État de droit et la démocratie qui a eu lieu dans de nombreux pays (Argentine, Chili, Afrique du Sud, Haïti, pour n'en citer que quelques-uns) au cours de ces dernières décennies a remis à l'ordre du jour le problème de l'amnistie. Doit-on, au nom de la réconciliation et de la paix civile, renoncer à traduire en justice les anciens bourreaux ? Ou bien doiton, au nom de la justice due aux victimes, les traduire en justice ? Poser la question de cette façon, c'est suggérer qu'il existe une opposition absolue entre l'amnistie et la justice. Dans notre contribution, nous voudrions montrer que cette opposition n'est pas aussi absolue qu'on le pense et que l'amnistie peut aussi parfois être nécessaire pour préserver ou réinstaurer les conditions de possibilité de la justice. The transition towards a state of law and democracy which has taken place in many countries in the last decades (Argentina, Chili, South Africa, Haïti, to mention just a few) brings up again the problem of amnisty. In the name of reconciliation and civil peace, should former torturers and hangmen be released from justice? Or, to do justice to victims, should they be brought to trial? Put that way, the question suggests an absolute opposition between amnisty and justice. In this article we want to show that this opposition is not so absolute as one might think and that amnisty is sometimes necessary to preserve or to re-instate the condititions for the possibility of justice.<br>

Abstract: Pour décrire les moyens dont dispose l'individu pour se constituer en personne (partagée entre l'identité du caractère, l'idem, et le soi plus personnel et moral de l 'ipse), Paul Ricœur, dans Soi-même comme un autre (Paris, Seuil 1990), emprunte aux linguistes deux ensembles conceptuels: les références identifiantes (noms propres) et les actes d'autodésignation du je. Mais, par ce double biais, la pragmatique linguistique conduirait, selon lui, à une impasse, éludant finalement la question du qui? C'est oublier que, dans l'énonciation, le je lui-même acquiert une certaine épaisseur sémantique. Une poésie mimétique d'action comme la poésie lyrique grecque montre le rôle que peut jouer dans la constitution du moi une identité énonciative collective, qui inscrit d'emblée la dialectique entre l'idem et l'ipse dans le rapport avec les autres, sans référence ni métaphysique ni théologique. To describe the means the individual has for establishing personhood (between character identity, the idem, and the more personnel and moral self of the ipse), Paul Ricoeur, in Oneself as Another (English translation 1992), borrows two conceptual ensembles from linguistics: the identifying references (proper nouns) and the self-designating acts of the self. But, according to him, by taking this double bias, linguistic pragmatics leads to an impasse by finally eluding the question "who". This is to forget that in enunciation, the very self acquires a certain semantic depth. A mimetic poetry of action, like Greek lyrical poetry, shows the role that can be played in the constitution of the self by a collectively enunciated identity, which automatically sets the dialectic between the idem and the ipse in relation to others, without metaphysical or theological reference.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'attèle à montrer comment les notions principales de l'herméneutique de Ricœur (monde du texte/monde du lecteur, distanciation – appropriation, compréhension de soi trois mimèsis) ont permis de penser de façon systématique la question du statut du texte biblique et de sa traduction dans un mémoire de licence de la Faculté de théologie de Neuchâtel, réalisé en 2006. Après une présentation du mémoire et de son contexte, les apports de la pensée de Ricœur sont énumérés en quatre points : la théorie de la traduction, la notion de lecture non utilisatrice, la notion de canon et celle de «texte inspiré». This article sets out to show how the principal notions of Ricoeur's hermeneutics (the textual world/the reader's world, distantiation - appropriation, self-comprehension, three mimesis) made possible a systematic exposition of the question of the status of biblical text and its translation in a licentiate thesis at the Faculty of Theology of Neuchâtel, in 2006. Once the thesis and its context are presented, the contributions of Ricoeur's ideas are enumerated in four points: translation theory, the notions of nonuser readings, of canonicity, and of «inspired text».<br>

Abstract: Suite à une question initiale du théologien catholique Adrian Holderegger, l'auteur s'interroge sur la question du rôle de la raison en théologie et en éthique théologique. Il présente et discute la critique de la raison sourde proposée par Maurice Bellet. Les relations entre la rationalité athétique, athématique et amodale conduisent à se demander si une conception négative et critique de la rationalité ne serait pas la condition d'un redéploiement positif de la raison de l'être humain singulier comme capacité d'écoute attentive de l'autre, du monde et de Dieu. Following up an initial question raised by the Catholic theologian Adrian Holderegger, the author questions the role of reason in theology and in theological ethics. He presents and discusses the critique of blind reason proposed by Maurice Bellet. The interactions between a-thetic, a-thematic and a-modal rationality leads one to wonder if a negative and critical conception of rationality might not be the condition for a positive redeployment of a single human beings reason as capacity for attentive listening to others, to the world and to God.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette étude je poursuis deux objectifs: d'une part, je tente d'établir d'un point de vue théorique les tenants et aboutissants de la question de savoir si le pardon entre deux communautés est possible; d'autre part, j'examine les obstacles et les dangers d'un tel pardon. En ce qui concerne le premier objectif, je fais appel à Hannah Arendt qui nous a donné dans La condition de l'homme modeme une définition du pardon que j'applique aux relations entre communautés. Afin d'examiner les problèmes d'un pardon inter-communautaire, je usage du roman de J. M. Coetzee, Disgrâce, qui offre à mon sens une illustration de ce qu'un tel pardon entraînerait. La situation que décrit Coetzee, et a laquelle je me réfère également, est celle de l'Afrique du Sud après l'apartheid. In this study, I have two aims: one, from a theoretical viewpoint, I try to establish the ins and outs of the question whether pardon between two communities is possible; secondly, I examine the obstacles and dangers of such a pardon. For the first, I refer to Hannah Arendt, who gives us, in The Human Condition, a definition of pardon, which apply to the relations between communities. In order to examine the problems of intercommunal pardon, I use the novel by J. M. Coetzee, Disgrace, which offers, according to me, an illustration of what such a pardon entails. The situation described by Coetzee, and to which I also refer, is that of South Africa after apartheid.<br>

Abstract: Comme son sous-titre l'indique, cet article a pour but de développer un contrepoint au livre de Pierre Gisel qui fait l'objet du débat présenté dans ce numéro. En dialogue critique avec cet ouvrage, il tente de formuler une autre manière de concevoir la théologie aujourd'hui. Après avoir explicité les conditions et la base d'accord de ce dialogue, il reprend successivement la question de la définition de la théologie, le problème des rapports entre théologie et sciences des religions et les difficultés liées à la relecture des héritages, pour se terminer par une évaluation globale du projet de Pierre Gisel. As indicated by its sub-title, this article develops an objection to the book of Pierre Gisel, subject of the debate in the present edition. In critical dialogue, it tries to formulate a different way of conceiving theology today. After exposing the conditions and basis for agreement in this debate, it takes up in succession the question of the definition of theology, the problem of the relationships between theology and the science of religions and the difficulties linked to the re-reading of traditions, finishing with a global evaluation of the project of Pierre Gisel.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Abstract: Le but de cette intervention est de mettre en dialogue les pensées de Paul Ricœur et de Gerhard Ebeling à partir du concept de parole efficace. La première partie entreprend de montrer, notamment à travers les lectures ricœuriennes d'Ebeling dans les années 1960 et 1980, que le théologien allemand est plus «barthien» que le philosophe français en ce qui concerne le mouvement herméneutique de la distanciation. Dans la seconde partie, question se pose, à travers une confrontation plus indirecte entre les deux auteurs, de savoir dans quelle mesure Ricœur est plus «barthien» qu'Ebeling par rapport au mouvement contraire de l'appropriation. Dans sa conclusion, l'auteur avance la thèse selon laquelle Ebeling serait plus cohérent que Ricœur dans sa réflexion autour de la parole efficace. The aim of this essay is to juxtapose the thinking of Paul Ricoeur and Gerhard Ebeling on the basis of the concept of efficient word. The first part, notably through Ricoeur's reading of Ebeling, tries to show that in the 1960's-80's, the German theologian was more «Barthian» than the French philosopher on the topic of the hermeneutical movement of detachment. The second part, by a more indirect confrontation between the two writers, poses the question to what degree Ricoeur is more «Barthian» that Ebeling on the opposite movement of appropriation. The article concludes with the theory that Ebeling is more coherent than Ricoeur in his thinking about efficient word.<br>

Abstract: Dans son traitement de l'éthique, Ruwen Ogien combine de manière neuve ce qu'il est souvent convenu d'opposer: l'éthique normative, l'éthique appliquée et la méta-éthique. Son point de départ, analytique, le pousse à se méfier des expressions pompeuses. En même temps, l'attention méthodologique qu'il porte aux différentes formulations possibles des principes substantiels de l'éthique minimale le conduit à réinterroger les liens entre le Bien et le Juste et donc aussi les rapports entre l'éthique et la politique. In his approach to ethics, Ogien does something new in combining what we usually oppose: normative ethics, applied ethics and meta-ethics. His analytical starting-point leads him to distrust pretentious expressions. At the same time, his methodological attention to various possible formulations of the substantial principles of minimalist ethics leads him to question anew the links between Good and Right and therefore also the relationship between ethics and politics.<br>

Abstract: Masking is ubiquitous to the culture areas of the world and is a symbolic activity inextricably associated cross-culturally with cosmological drama and shamanic ritual. Our question is, "Masks work how?" In Part 1, we place masks within their physical, cultural and cosmological context so as to view the activity of masking as part of a wider symbolic process. Masks are seen to be transformations of face. In Part 2, the work of masking is realized as a transformation of experience, and is related to a general cycle of meaning in culture whereby cosmological beliefs give rise to direct experience, and experience verifies and vivifies cosmology. And in Part 3 the "how" of masking is explained using a biogenetic structural perspective which traces the possible transformations of brain that may occur within the wearer and audience and that may mediate a variety of mask-related experiences.<br>

Author(s): Greisch Jean<br>
Abstract: La question de la métaphore se pose à trois niveaux: celui de l'analyse sémantique (philosophie analytique du langage), celui de sa fonction herméneutique (Paul Ricœur), enfin la question proprement « ontologique » de sa portée pour l'ensemble du discours philosophique comme tel. L'étude présente est une contribution à cette dernière problématique, envisagée à partir du discours de Martin Heidegger. L'étude se fait en trois étapes : liquidation de la représentation métaphysique de la métaphore; la métaphore dans le discours philosophique de Heidegger; retour d'une nouvelle problématique de la métaphore, autour du couple métaphore morte/métaphore vivante. The question of metaphor in philosophy may be asked in three different ways: analysis of its function (anglo-saxon philosophy of language); link with the problem of interpretation (hermeneutics); finally the « ontological » question of its meaning for philosophical discourse as such. The present study is a contribution to the latter question, focused on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. The question is developped in threee steps: elimination of the metaphysical conception of metaphor; the metaphor inside the philosophical discourse of Heidegger; come-back of a new conception of metaphor, which has not yet been completely shaped out, but which must be related to the opposition of dead and living metaphor.<br>

Abstract: L'article étudie les modifications successives et conjointes des arguments de convenance et des structures du traité de l'Incarnation au long de l'itinéraire de S. Thomas. Il se propose de contester l'habitude de réduire la place du Christ dans la Somme Théologique à la simple causalité rédemptrice. Une lecture attentive de la première question de la Tertia pars de la Somme Théologique établit que l'opposition habituelle entre Incarnation et Rédemption se trouve dépassée dans la découverte du mystère pascal de Jésus comme la manifestation et la réalité de Dieu toujours plus grand. La Christologie est alors tout autre chose qu'un appendice : la consummatio totius theologici negotii, clef de voûte et principe de toute la théologie. The article studies the successive and conjunct modifications of the arguments of convenance and the structures the treatise on the Incarnation throughout St. Thomas' itinerary. It is proposed to contest the habit of reducing the place of Christ in the Summa Theologica to a simple redemptive causality. An attentive reading of the first question of the Tertia Pars of the Summa Theologica establishes that the habitual opposition between Incarnation and Redemption is found to be surpassed in the discovery of the Pascal Mystery of Jesus as the manifestation and reality of the always greater God. The Christology is then quite other than a mere appendix: the consummatio totius theologici negotii, keystone and principle of all theology.<br>

Abstract: Le silence des théologiens sur ce qui, jadis, fit partie de leur discipline suscite une question: pourquoi les anges se sont-ils tus? Comment pourraient-ils à nouveau parler? L'article tente de répondre à la question en rappelant d'abord ce que pourrait suggérer au mathématicien l'antique doctrine des « substances séparées ». Mais, et surtout, au-delà de la « substance », au-delà même des « missions » que la Bible lui assigne, l'ange semble bénéficier d'une dimension « poétique ». L'auteur tente une élucidation de cette fonction poétique, en liaison avec ce qu'il appelle la fonction « Méta ». The silence of theologians on what was formerly a part of their scholarly discipline raises a question: why have the angels become silent? How could they speak once again? This article intends to answer the question by first recalling what the ancient doctrine of "separated substances" would suggest to a mathematician. But more importantly, beyond "substance" and even beyond the "messenger" role that the Bible gives them, angels seem to be endowed with a "poetic" dimension. The author attempts to elucidate this poetic function in connexion with what he calls the "meta" function.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude propose une approche « textologique » du texte scripturaire, à l'interface de la philosophie de la religion et de la philosophie du texte. Elle repose sur deux hypothèses : 1. penser, c'est interroger; la pensée religieuse est une interrogation sur le salut. 2. le sens se textualise en achevant de saturer les trois dimensions de la signifiance (référence, communicabililé, symbolisme). Trois raisons sont données, après le textual turn en philosophie, pour distinguer « texte » et « discours » : structurelle, « érotétique », clause de clôture du Canon des Écritures. Du même coup, le rôle de l'expérience religieuse est dérivé. La méthode est celle de l'analyse conceptuelle des problématiques. This study proposes a "textological" approach to scriptural text, at the interface of the philosophy of religion with the philosophy of the text. It avances two hypothesis: 1. to think is to question; religious thought raises the question of salvation. 2. the meaning textualizes itself by completely saturating the three dimensions of signification (reference, communicabiliiy, symbolism). Three reasons are given, following the textual turn in philosophy, for distinguishing between "text" and "discourse": structure, "erotetics", and the closing clause of the scriptural Canon. At the same time the role of religious experience is explained. The method used is that of the conceptual analysis of problematics.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'Essai sur le mal, Jean Nabert, poursuivant une démarche déjà engagée dans les Éléments pour une éthique, affronte la question de la possibilité d'une justification de l'existence humaine, L'A. propose une analyse des grandes étapes de cet essai Dans le ch. 1, il décrit les diverses figures d'un mal excédant le champ défini par les normes de la moralité, et recherche les conditions de possibilité d'une telle expérience. Dans les ch. 2 à 4, il poursuit l'analyse de l'expérience d'un mal intérieur au vouloir propre et que dissimule la réduction de celui-ci à la transgression des normes d'un sujet autonome, et il examine la compréhension de soi du sujet de l'expérience impliquée dans cette dimension du mal. Dans le dernier chapitre, il pose la question des limites de ce que permet d'espérer une « approche de la justification » par un moi tel qu'il s'est d'abord compris par réflexion sur ces données fondamentales de son expérience; au sommet de cette approche, il aborde la question de la possibilité du pardon. Pursuing along the same lines as in his Éléments pour une éthique, Jean Nabert, in his Essai sur le mal, tackles the question of the possibility of justifying human existence. The author proposes to analyze the major stages in this essay. In chapter 1, he describes diverse representations of evil that exceed the boundaries as defined by the norms of morality, and researches the conditions in which such experiences are possible. In chapters 2 to 4, he continues the analysis of evil intrinsic to will itself, which is obscured by the reduction of this evil to the transgression of an autonomous subject's limits, and examines the subject's comprehension of self when implicated in this dimension of evil. In the last chapter, the question is asked of the limitations of that which an « approach to justification » may permit to be hoped for by a self such as first understood upon reflexion of the fundamental data of his experience; at the apex of this approach, he ad~<br>

Abstract: Cette Note présente l'ouvrage de Christian Duquoc, intitulé L'unique Christ. La symphonie différée, en en suivant le déroulement et en se montrant particulièrement attentif à son apport christologique. L'approche ne se limite pas à la question de la médiation unique du Christ. Elle aborde aussi le rapport du Christ à l'histoire et au cosmos, le sens de la mission de l'Église, sa relation au judaïsme, la signification du salut et la façon de l'envisager dans le cadre d'une pluralité des religions. Au long de sa présentation, l'auteur de cette Note montre que la théologie développée dans cet ouvrage se trouvait déjà largement amorcée dans les précédents travaux de Duquoc. This Note introduces the work of Christian Duquoc, entitled L'unique Christ. La symphonie différée, surveying its development and paying particular attention to its Christological contribution. Its approach is not limited to the question of Christ's unique mediation. It takes up as well Christ's relation to history and to the cosmos, the meaning of the Church's mission, its relation to Judaism, its signification of salvation, and the way of envisaging it within the setting of a plurality of religions. During the course of his presentation, the author of this Note shows that the theology developed in this work was largely initiated in Duquoc's earlier works.<br>

Abstract: En vue de se laisser enseigner par les lettres philosophiques, l'auteur s'applique à reconnaître, depuis Platon jusqu'à Nietzsche, l'insistance et l'existence des questions relatives au mal. La nature (quid), l'origine (unde) et la justification (cur) sollicitent toujours et autrement la pensée du mal. Au commencement, de Plotin à Leibniz, le moment ontologique retravaille la question de la nature à partir de la question de l'origine, mais pour résoudre le mal de la volonté dans le non-être du mal. Il faut que s'affirme avec Kant la préséance du vouloir sur l'être, l'auto-position de la volonté libre, pour que le moment éthique associe l'essence positive du mal à la recherche de son origine. Lorsqu'enfin dans la perspective de Nietzsche s'impose le moment généalogique, la question de la théodicée se transforme en question du langage. Là où se dit la justification de la volonté, c'est une volonté de justification qui parle. L'article se conclut en préparant une pensée du mal qui réunirait l'horizon de l'attente à celui de la genèse. The author, with the aim of being taught by philosophical letters, applies himself to acknowledge from Plato to Nietzsche the persistence and existence of the questions relating to evil. The nature (quid), the origin (unde) and the justification (cur) always and in different ways urge the thought of evil. In the beginning, from Plotin to Leibniz, the metaphysical instance works again at the question of nature starting from the question of origin, but in order to solve the evil of the will power in the non existing of evil. It will need Kant's assertion of the precedency of the will over the being, the auto-position of the free will in order that the ethical moment may associats the positive essence of evil to the search for its origin.

Abstract: Cet article passe en revue les ouvrages suivants du neurobiologiste Jean-Pierre Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (un dialogue avec Paul Ricœur), 1998, L'homme de vérité, 2002. L'auteur y montre les changements dans les thèses de Changeux en les accompagnant de ses commentaires philosophiques et théologiques aussi bien critiques que constructifs. L'homme, ses origines et sa structure, le cerveau humain, la conscience de soi, la matière et sa complexité évolutive, la sensibilité artistique, la morale, la religion, la question d'une lecture intégrale de Darwin et de Spinoza, la signification du discours sur « l'homme de vérité » sont les principaux sujets traités. Le but de l'article est un dialogue interdisciplinaire entre neurosciences et théologie sur la compréhension de l'être humain. This article passes in revue the following works of the neurobiologist J.-P. Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (a dialogue with Paul Ricœur), 1998, and L'homme de vérité, 2002. The author shows the changes in Changeux's theses, accompanying them with his philosophical and theological commentaries, critical as well as constructive. Man, his origins and structure, the human brain, self consciousness, matter and its progressive complexity, artistic sensibility, morality, religion, the question of an integral reading of Darwin and Spinoza, and the significance of discourse upon « L'homme de vérité » are the principal subjects treated. The goal of the article is an interdisciplinary dialogue between the neurosciences and theology about the understanding of the human being.<br>

Abstract: This introduction of the HSR Special Issue on "Critique and Social Change: Historical, Cultural, and Institutional Perspectives" addresses the question of how critique and social change are interrelated. Conflicts and disputes are considered to be a major source of critique. We distinguish three types of conflicts: (1) Value conflicts result from the ongoing process of rationalization and the differentiation of relatively autonomous "value spheres" (Weber) such as politics, economy, science, law, etc. (2) The growth and expansion of these value spheres, e.g. the growth of capitalism, in turn produce new forms of inequalities and leads to distributional conflicts. (3) As questions of distribution and inclusion are closely linked, critique also originates from identity conflicts, which address the social recognition of individuals and collectivities. In order to understand how critique is related to social change, we suggest that critique can be studied either as a condition for or as an effect from social change. Based on this distinction we provide an overview over the contributions of this volume.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219721<br>
Date: 10 1, 1924<br>
Author(s): Condillac Juliet Flower<br>
Abstract: Rousseau opposed both traditional and modern (empiricist) thinking when he made self-love the cornerstone of his system. Other modes of thought treat self-consciousness as constituted primarily by temporal desire. Rousseau raises love, for him the suspension of desire, to a position of ontological primacy in regard to self-consciousness. Like Pascal, he throws the empirical existence of the self into radical question and finds it to be as insubstantial and empty a concept as the Western tradition has found it-from Ecclesiastes and Socrates on. Rousseau declines the moralistic reproof of the self, however, and emphasizes its insubstantiality as its one strength, although a fictional one. The self exists only in the mode of a hypothesis (the fictional "as if"): it is a failure at being. But to amour (and to pitié) it makes all the difference and is worthy of their support.<br>

Publisher: American University in Cairo. Department of English and Comparative Literature<br>
Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Issue: i222578<br>
Date: 1 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Thiongo Sabry<br>
Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226398<br>
Date: 11 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Zambouke Charles<br>
Abstract: In this study of Greek dreams at moments of illness and anxiety I explore the relationship between individual experience and cultural representation. Ethnographic data and textual sources show that the image of fields recurs in dreams, thus throwing into question the uniqueness of personal experience as well as the concept of "experience" as something separate from cultural narratives. Yet these same images might also be independently generated "from below" by the emotional, physical experience of distress and illness. This case points to the convergence of cultural and personal symbols and to their fusion in the moment of experience. Approaches from psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and folklore studies all provide possible theorizations. None of these options excludes the others. The image of the field in dreams is overdetermined precisely because the historicocultural, the cognitive, the psychobiological, and the social all simultaneously figure in human experience.

Author(s): Žižek Georgina<br>
Abstract: This essay uses the work of psychoanalyst Melanie Klein to reopen the dialogue between anthropology and psychoanalysis. It argues that Kleinian concepts enhance an anthropology that seeks out both intersubjective and intrasubjective difference and disjuncture, and it demonstrates the uses of major Kleinian concepts for addressing classic anthropological problems, including gender classification and the analysis of persecution in witchcraft and sorcery systems. Applying Kleinian concepts to the analysis of cultural-historical process, it shows how splitting and denial may be central to the reproduction and hegemony of dominant cultural systems through time and addresses the question of how to theorize the relationship among dominant cultural systems, social differentiation, and individual subjectivities.<br>

Abstract: Summary: On the Relations between the Sociology and the Semiology of Music. The aim of this article is to inquire what relations are possible between the semiology and the sociology of music. The first section attempts a definition of semiology: it may be understood as the science of signs, as the use of linguistic models in the description of non-linguistic fields, or as a programme of research specific to the humanities and the social sciences which distinguishes between the aspects of production, reception and the immanence of the meaning in question. The second section, through a critical analysis of a text by Barthes, explores the question of whether semiology can be understood as the science of musical ideologies. It demonstrates that semiology has no specific methodology with which to meet these problems. The third section investigates the possibility of using semiology to assist in reconciling musical and social structures. After briefly recalling several positions on this subject, we suggest that the 'neutral level' of description, presented above as one of the elements of semiological analysis, can serve as a necessary preliminary to the harmonising of musical with social structures.<br>

Abstract: October 17th, 2011. In the Parisian region and the neighbouring suburbs of the Hauts-de-Seine, the 50th commemoration of the massacre of Algerians in Paris led to the institutionalization of the colonial memory. By virtue of their duration and their size, these commemorative ceremonies questioned the particular period during which the French colonial past appeared in former and present socialist and communist councils. In Nanterre – a commune situated in the North-western suburbs of Paris that has had a communist council since 1935 – this memory is exceptional due to its long colonial and postcolonial history. Although the largest Algerian slum in France was to be found in the Nanterre of the 1950s and 1960s, for many years, the council remained completely silent about the massacre of Algerian activists in 1961. It is only recently that the massacre has started to be commemorated in Nanterre. This can be explained by two significant and recent transformations of the city: firstly, its demographic and urban transformation; and secondly, the change of its political elite, following a boom in the number of local associations and activist networks working on the question of the local (and colonial) memory. The emergence of this memory in the micro-politics of Nanterre responds to the need for a common and unified identity of its residents, an identity that the working class and communist banners have failed to provide. The residents’ struggle to have a school named after the Algerian sociologist Abdelmalek Sayad – who wrote on Nanterre’s slums – and a street named after Abdennbi Guémiah – a teenager killed by a racist neighbour in the early 1980s – testify to the need for such a memory. The heritage and memory of immigration in the city has now become a core issue in Nanterre’s local politics. It helps political authorities build a brandnew image and overcome the mistakes of the past by recognizing its (post)colonial citizens. Beyond the dead and the words, the sudden e~<br>

Abstract: Do divergent values embedded in distinctive cultures satisfactorily explain current directions in public service ethics around the world? The authors draw upon expert observation by government and corporate officials who administer ethics programs, leaders known for their moral courage, survey research, and the scholarly literature to identify these directions and begin addressing the question. The central argument is that observable practice increasingly invalidates an approach that relies exclusively upon cultural particularities. Identified commonalties susceptible to objective research include shared values and norms such as impartiality and effectiveness in public service, structural elements in part fostered by shared goals and multinational anti-corruption initiatives, and the self-conscious injection of normative components into ethics programs. Emerging from a cross-cultural empirical perspective that allows for mutualities as well as differences, the authors' rich research agenda included investigation of the alleged links between public attitudes and ethics programs and between codes and actual administrative behavior, and development of appropriate measures of ethics programs' effectiveness. They concluded that professional public administration must remain intellectually open to global dialogue on shared values, norms, and structures.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: Is the most important function of education to provide students with basic skills and useful knowledge in order to eventually become employable? In many parts of the world knowledge league tables and policy documents inform us this is the case. As the question of what should form the educational content seems to be answered, teachers can concentrate on how they should teach, and researchers can concentrate on what method is the most effective. In the current rhetoric, however, many vital pedagogical issues have been placed in the background and the aesthetic subjects are downgraded. These tendencies worried Frede V. Nielsen who stated that didactic studies and philosophical inquiries yet again are needed to explore and give substance to the content dimension. Nielsen's writings on didactics form the basis for this essay, where we highlight which perspectives and dilemmas could be placed on a critical, philosophical didactic study agenda. The starting point is the field of tension between the what and the why of education.<br>

Abstract: For both Levinas and Derrida, the practice of philosophy, understood as commentary by the former and deconstruction by the latter, was founded on borrowing terms from other languages and finding their equivalents in French. This argument is developed through a discussion of two texts, Levinas's early Talmudic reading, “The Temptation of Temptation,” and Derrida's deconstruction of
         The Merchant of Venicein “What Is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?” This essay shows how translated terms are interwoven into these texts. It also shows that translation is essential to Levinas's and Derrida's creative conceptualization, and to the performativity of their philosophies, meaning that Levinas and Derrida open their language to other languages in order to create concepts. It finally argues that in both Derrida and Levinas the question of the limits of translation, namely, of the moment in which translation becomes conversion, is left open.<br>

Abstract: There is quite a lot more to say, in fact. As we've seen, cultural cannibalism is a practice that is deeply embedded in and responsive to problems of power. It is crucial to situate discourses of authenticity and mimesis within history to uncover the ways in which poets have worked around and against those discourses. The question of contemporary experimental poetry's response to the abundance and waste of late capitalism, and how the cannibal figures within it, bears further exploration. Twentieth- and twenty-first-century readers must stay attuned to the omnipresence of cultural mastication, as De Campos calls it:
      
               The “new barbarians” are still at it: Consume, produce, repeat.The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: The senselessness of Charles Taylor's war is demonstrated in a particularly painful way through the suggestion that the soldiers no longer know why they fight. But our attention remains with the dancer who has now lost the means for his art, for that which gave meaning to his life. And he sits by the roadside waiting. What exactly is the dancer waiting for? Does this dancer wait in the same way that the speaker in “Where the Road Turns” does? In the dancer's waiting, the poet leaves a hole in our hearts, a great longing symbolized by his missing limbs. Perhaps the question of what the dancer is waiting for is better left unanswered. It is, in the manner of Levi's “If This Is a Man,” designed to raise questions that any answer would diminish.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The continent of Africa has been an important meaning for several cultures over at least three millennia; it is, however, only in the modern period that an Africana discourse became a practical and theoretical necessity. Mudimbe, as a part of his initial discussion of an African gnosis, poses this urgent question, “Would it then be possible to renew the notion of tradition from, let us say, a radical
         dispersionof African cultures?”
               Similar sentiment is echoed in the caution expressed by David L. Schoenbrun in an article devoted to the history of public health in East Africa. In this article he worries that the possibility for a distinctive novelty which might be forthcoming from these traditions is always in danger of becoming dominated by the discursive narrative of Protestantism or capitalism. He holds out the possibility of alternative narratives arising out of African history that would be in tension with the dominating Western discourses and would speak more directly to the traditions and rhythms of African temporalities.23
            
               Schoenbrun alludes to a comment made by his historian colleague Steve Feierman, one of the contributors to the24
            Africa and the Disciplinesvolume. Feierman's essay shows how African history contributes to the dissolution of the notion of a “world” or “universal” history so admired in the academy. In the midst of his discussion of historians and historiography in several parts of the globe, he has this to say about the American Civil Rights Movement: “The slaves and the barbarians were not coincidental to civilization, aberrant at the margins; they were constitutive of civilization, the way civilization defined itself. With the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, similar perceptions began to emerge.”
               Had Feierman been as attentive to African American history in the United States as he has been to East African history, he would have realized that African Ame~<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: An early SPEP paper by Earle made a strong impression on me in this regard—though not, I think, in quite the way he intended.
      
            He argued that our fledgling movement seemed to be developing a dual personality. On the one hand, we seemed to be trading in the traditional metaphysics of human nature for a rigorous Husserlian science of human life's “essentials”; and on the other hand, we were producing an existentialist excess of “ontological autobiographies” that glorified various purely contingent and accidental senses of how life might be lived. But surely Earle's dualism was too traditional to capture what we all wanted to say both about the human condition “in general”11
         andabout the unique possibilities open to every individual. Indeed, Earle himself was especially hard on those who tried to avoid sayinganythingtoo generally, for fear they might objectify life's deepest dimensions, oranythingtoo specifically, lest it be taken as merely philosophical special pleading. What, he demanded, do twoExistenzentalk about? To be struck dumb by this question would be to betray one's possessing a very unphenomenological allegiance to an objectivist conception of language.<br>

Abstract: While sharing a planet may be necessary for peace, as we know, it is not that simple. Although we occupy the finite surface of the earth, our experiences here can be worlds apart. As Derrida (
      2011, especially 8–12) suggests in the last seminar before his death, we do not, and cannot, ever know if we inhabit or cohabit the same world as any other creature on earth. This includes not just strangers, enemies, and those we find most abhorrent but also our fellows, kin, and most beloved, whose singularity is just as other to us as any other. And then there are those other others, the ones Levinas and Derrida lose sleep over, those others whom/that we do not recognize, those so radically other that we cannot even call them foreigners, enemies, aliens, or monsters—those that may inhabit the same planet but live in worlds radically different from our own, to the point of calling into question this “our own” and what it means to “have a world.”<br>

Abstract: Here is a final evocation of the unique nonsortal essence, which implicitly, I believe, argues for a nonsortal sense of oneself, works against the temptation to see “I” as merely a numerical individuation comparable to two identical peas, and thus also suggests a filled significant or existential-moral meaning for the question of nonsortal individuality.
            
                  It perhaps is to be found first in Leibniz and then in the formulation in C. S. Pierce and John M. E. McTaggart, but I will share Roderick Chisholm's version of it with you.32
               
                  What is at stake here is not whether memory is essential for identifying by way of criteria oneself throughout time but, rather, whether there is a nonsortal loose and odd sense of oneself and one's identity that may be more basic and may persist in the absence of memory—as the basis for our proper strong sense of having an identifying knowledge of ourselves. We may consider that even prior to such a thought experiment as I here propose we are already perhaps familiar with the small child's ability to make first-person references without having an arsenal of identifying properties that the parent and others have, for example, regarding his physiognomy, voice timbre, kind, lineage, gender, kinship, ethnicity, nationality, and so on and so forth. And we are more or less familiar with real or imagined cases of the amnesiac who says “I” and yet does not know who in the world she is; that is, she is bereft of any identifying properties but still achieves “I” inerrantly.33<br>

Abstract: A second major development of critical theory in the eighties was Habermas's critique of postmodernism. In 1984 I invited Habermas to Boston, where he gave a version of his
            Discourse of Modernity, which included an appropriation of the Frankfurt school and a critique of the so-called postmoderns, including, among others, Foucault, Heidegger, and Derrida. Habermas wrote his critique of Derrida while at Boston College, where before giving it he complained of not being able to find the code. Eventually, he gave the lecture, which led, as everyone knows, to the controversy that followed, alienating a potential friendship with Derrida for over a decade. Later Habermas confided, “You know, we became friends.” Ute Habermas chimed in, “Best friends.” And then Habermas turned to me and asked the inevitable question, which had bothered me since 1984, “Why didn't you people tell me that I was wrong?” Of course, we both laughed, and I said, “We didn't dare.”<br>

Abstract: We now reach the point at which I address the question in my title: “Can Continental philosophy deal with the New Technologies?” I characterized this earlier as somewhat ironic—because SPEP has never had questions of science and technology as forefront issues. One of my hobbies, as a veteran SPEPer myself, has been an annual “bean count” of the figures and topics in the program index. Very few entries could ever be found, with most not bearing the Heidegger–Marcuse tilt, and my own SPEP entries. This count shows up ratios of interest and changes of trends. So, with exceptions noted, Heidegger and Marcuse remained the primary “canonical” figures interpreting technology for SPEP. And it is to these figures that I address my critique of what I will call the “old philosophy of technology.”<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In my own opinion the most interesting expression of the religious turn in Continental philosophy is found in Derrida because Derrida is by anyone's standards a secular thinker and even, by the standards of the local pastor or rabbi, an atheist. So it came as a shock to read about Derrida's “religion” in his famous “Circumfession” (1989), which is a deconstructive riff on Augustine's
            Confessionsin which Derrida restages the scene of theConfessions. We come upon a scene in which the speaker (Augustine/Jackie), an emigrant from North Africa to the Big Apple (Rome/Paris), has his back to us and is praying to someone (te, God/tu), while his mother (Monica/Georgette) lies dying on the northern shore of the Mediterranean (Ostia/Nice). Derrida tells us that he has been praying all his life and that no one, not even his mother, has understood this, which has led to a misunderstanding of his work.
                  But to whom is Derrida praying, and how could he be praying at all? Does he not “rightly pass for an atheist”?20
               
                  There is a more obscure sense of religion “without religion” in Derrida, and a prayer to a God not only unknown but nonexistent that nonetheless constitutes a genuine prayer. If, as Jean-Louis Chrétien says, himself one of the new religious phenomenologists,21
               prayeris a “wounded word,” what word is more wounded than a word from one who does not know to whom he is praying (a lost letter, destination unknown), or if anyone is there to hear his prayers, or if he is praying at all, who has to pray to be able to pray at all, for something, he knows not what, something “coming,” the coming or incoming (invention) of something unforeseeable?
                  Derrida's atheism is crucially important to his religion because it allows him to isolate the very structure of prayer, and hence of the religious posture, with or without what we in the great monotheisms call “God,” thereby putting into questi~<br>

Abstract: The final section, “The Gift and the Animal: Rethinking Politics and Critical Theory,” brings together two articles in social and political theory. Alan Schrift's article, “Should Philosophers Still Read Mauss? Thoughts on Contemporary American Politics,” revisits Marcel Mauss's 1925
      Essay on the Giftand argues that its significance for thinking about contemporary politics has yet to be fully appreciated. Schrift finds in Mauss's work an approach to left-wing politics that avoids the binary opposition between Marxism and liberal individualism; as a result, Schrift argues, Mauss's political theory offers important resources for defending social democracy in the context of contemporary American politics. Eduardo Mendieta's article, “The Silence of the Sirens: RereadingDialectic of Enlightenmentwith Kafka and Borges,” returns to the ur-text of Critical Theory and rereads it in light of what Mendieta calls “the animal question.” Weaving a trace among Homer'sOdysseus, Plato's allegory of the cave, and Horkheimer and Adorno'sDialectic of Enlightenment, Mendieta argues that the animal question has haunted Western philosophy from the beginning and thus that a critical philosophy must also become an animal philosophy.<br>

Abstract: The second result of this article, as I see it, is more speculative in nature, to the extent that it goes a little further than anything that either Ricoeur or Janicaud has explicitly said. Janicaud gives up the metaphysical ambitions of phenomenology to establish itself as a first philosophy, which leads the phenomenologist to be characterized rightly as a despot, or if taking a theological turn, a priest. But if a minimal phenomenology leads in a new direction, then what transformation of the phenomenologist's role would follow? What figure, in other words, would come to characterize the work of the minimal phenomenologist? Drawing from work that I have developed elsewhere, I can think of no better answer to this question than the figure of the translator, or to be even more precise, the code-switcher.

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Hyperboles are a contextual response to an exigence just as much as they are a way of perceiving and approaching meaning and being in general. Often creating intense
         affectusin the audience, Johnson suggests, “the hyperbolist perceives an extraordinary, outrageous, ridiculous, or ineffableres(thing, event, feeling, idea), while his or herverba(words, speech, language) strain discursive limits, analogical frameworks, and literary and rhetorical conventions, to represent thatres” (2010, 2). Here Johnson indicates that one would not use hyperbole or adopt a hyperbolic perspective unless the magnitude of some event or experience called for and justified its use. To be sure, those such as Levinas are responding to an extraordinary, contextualized experience or event, though it may not be readily apparent that their response is a hyperbolic one, and so the next question for hyperbole thus becomes one of intent. It is often presumed that hyperbole must be intentional, but as Ricoeur and Webb indicate, that is not necessarily the case, since one may be engaging in a practice of excess in philosophical argumentation in response to some extraordinary exigence without being fully aware that one is assuming a hyperbolic mode of thought.<br>

Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Gastronomical practice and his dramaturgical philosophy charmingly intertwine in his 1897 review of John T. Day's explicitly antivegetarian play
      The Fanatic. In it, Shaw expresses his bemusement with “a dramatist who makes the whole interest of his play depend on a passionate faith in the nutritiousness of a cutlet and a glass of wine.”
            Its plot concerns a young woman newly married to a rabid vegetarian and teetotaler who immediately proceeds to feed her such enormous quantities of meatless fare that only, as Shaw writes, “if she were an elephant working out a sentence of hard labor [would] she … possibly be able to get exercise enough to keep pace” (352–53). (The playwright himself had outlined the perils of such overeating in an 18867
         Pall Mall Gazetteop-ed titled “Failures of Inept Vegetarians.”) When she sickens, a doctor is called in who earnestly if predictably prescribes cutlets and wine. Clear in its answer to, in Shaw's words, the “question … of cucumbers versus corpses” (354),The Fanaticculminates in the doctor's impulsive elopement proposition to his patient and the husband's mysterious yet gracious gesture of dropping dead.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: To further establish the common chords in Plato and Marcuse, there is Socrates's analogy of rhetoric to painting, a comparison that is compatible with Marcuse's and Bloch's emphasis on artistic production. Specifically, Socrates is speaking of rhetoric in the media of writing. He says, “You know, Phaedrus, that's the strange thing about writing, which makes it truly analogous to painting. The painter's products stand before us as though they were alive, but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence.”
      
               Even the setting of the dialogue reverberates with utopian concepts. Socrates and Phaedrus walk outside the city walls in a kind of nowhere to have this dialectical conversation about rhetoric, the function of which is actual progress inside the walls of Athens. In this same way, Marcuse's utopian function for the arts refers to a forgotten and repressed good in the city, one that can only be nourished for material growth through nonmaterial, symbolic communication and persuasion in transcendent goodwill.31<br>

Abstract: In his review (for
         Utopian Studies) of Wicht'sUtopianism in James Joyce's “Ulysses,”David Samuelson points out that “Ulyssesundercuts nearly everything it presents, and challenges its readers to question its own and their own levels of reality.”
               Wicht stresses the same point himself: “the text deconstructs the axiological, ideological and intentional implications encoded in utopian projects”—“the text unmasks … the deceptiveness and incongruity of utopian social notions and messianic promises.”81
            
               Wicht underlines the emphasis that Joyce puts upon the contradictions within Utopianism's reification of its discursive alterity and its collapse in the face of material reality: “82
            Ulyssesreveals that the object of the utopian dream is lost once it is designed as real.”

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: The identification of orthodox modern architecture with Utopia, and by convenient extension with the presumed certain failure of both, is ultimately self-serving for an architectural profession in need of justification for its move toward any variety of stylistic postmodernisms in tandem with the discipline's abnegation of social responsibility, addressed by Bristol in the following:
         
               Bristol's observation that it was self-serving of architects and critics to pin the cause of building failure on those aspects of modernist design they disliked is indeed valuable. However, it also reveals how the genuine social agenda of twentieth-century modern architecture was rejected on the basis of taste, arguably justified by associating modernist architecture with Utopia and Utopia with failure. Emphasis on this helps to highlight how typical recollections of the crisis of Utopia in architecture and its causes (as told by Vidler, for example) conform to convention above all else. But such stories actually raise a more important question: How utopian—in general—was twentieth-century modern architecture anyway?The two most central critiques of the design of Pruitt-Igoe have come from successor movements to High Modernism: Postmodernism, and environment and behavior…. Pruitt-Igoe provides a convenient embodiment of all the alleged failings of Modernism…. Proponents of these new approaches attribute the problems of public housing to architectural failure, and propose as a solution a new approach to design. They do not in any significant way acknowledge the political-economic and social context for the failure of Pruitt-Igoe…. Pruitt-Igoe was shaped by … strategies … that did not emanate from the architects, but rather from the system in which they practice. The Pruitt-Igoe myth … not only inflates the power of the architect to effect social change, … it masks the extent to which the profession is implicated, inextricably, in structures and practices that it ~<br>
