  Chapter Three  Countersymbols and Confederacy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt14bs0wp">Superchurch</a><br>
  Abstract: Fundamentalism has its roots in revivalism, but the Fundamentalist movement of the twentieth century has emerged as a radical reformulation of revivalist idealism. When Charles Finney addressed listeners and readers in his 1835
                  Lectures on Revivals of Religion, he warned of individual enemies that the revival church would have to confront and overcome in order to establish Christ’s kingdom on earth. He warned of “professors of religion” who would dismiss and speak against the work of revival. He warned often of a personal devil who conspired to keep sinners out of heaven. When he spoke against institutions and systems, however,<br>

  Hermeneutical Rhetoric from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: “Hermeneutical rhetoric” is the counterpart of Steven Mailloux’s “rhetorical hermeneutics.” In an article bearing that title and more extensively in his book
                  Rhetorical Power, Mailloux offers an “antitheory theory” of interpretation that situates literary hermeneutics within the context of rhetorical exchange.¹ Traditional literary theory, Mailloux argues, relies upon a general conception of interpretation as the basis for justifying particular interpretative acts. Such “theory” takes two forms—“textual realism,” where meaning is found in the text, and “readerly idealism,” where meaning is made through intersubjective agreements among a community of interpreters. As theories, these positions are diametrically opposed, but, Mailloux maintains,<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Recognizing Americans through Scouting from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1tqx76n">To Become an American</a><br>
  Abstract: In her 1918 handbook on the management of girls’ clubs, Helen Ferris suggested methods for forming clubs among immigrant girls. She directed readers, presumably club leaders and members, to find a “foreign girl” with whom you may “get acquainted with most easily.”¹ Ferris continued: “Ask her to introduce you to other foreign girls who she thinks would like to make the summer useful by learning more about America, by learning how to do something, and by having good times.”² For Ferris, girls’ clubs aided the acculturation of the “foreign girl” to the American way of life. Ferris was not alone<br>

  The Meaning of Security from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Chilton Paul A.<br>
  Abstract: “And, you all know, security is mortals’ chiefest enemy.” These are the words of Hecate to the three Witches in
                  Macbeth.A modern reader may experience momentary difficulty in constructing a meaning for them, sincesecurityhas come to be regarded in twentieth-century anglophone culture as one of the chiefest goods. Hecate’s words are thus paradoxical, unless one is a critic of the security culture itself. Shakespeare and his contemporaries, however, although they had begun to use the word also in something like its modern sense, knew a different meaning based on the word's Latin etymology.Securityderives fromse<br>

  Book Title: Executing Democracy-Volume One: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hartnett Stephen John<br>
  Abstract: Executing Democracy: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807is the first volume of a rhetorical history of public debates about crime, violence, and capital punishment in America. This examination begins in 1683, when William Penn first struggled to govern the rowdy indentured servants of Philadelphia, and continues up until 1807, when the Federalists sought to impose law-and-order upon the New Republic.This volume offers a lively historical overview of how crime, violence, and capital punishment influenced the settling of the New World, the American Revolution, and the frantic post-war political scrambling to establish norms that would govern the new republic.By presenting a macro-historical overview, and by filling the arguments with voices from different political camps and communicative genres, Hartnett provides readers with fresh perspectives for understanding the centrality of public debates about capital punishment to the history of American democracy.<br>

  Book Title: The Red Sea-In Search of Lost Space<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wick Alexis<br>
  Abstract: The Red Sea has, from time immemorial, been one of the world's most navigated spaces, in the pursuit of trade, pilgrimage and conquest. Yet this multidimensional history remains largely unrevealed by its successive protagonists. Intrigued by the absence of a holistic portrayal of this body of water and inspired by Fernand Braudel's famous work on the Mediterranean, this book brings alive a dynamic Red Sea world across time, revealing the particular features of a unique historical actor. In capturing this heretofore lost space, it also presents a critical, conceptual history of the sea, leading the reader into the heart of Eurocentrism. The Sea, it is shown, is a vital element of the modern philosophy of history.Alexis Wick is not satisfied with this inclusion of the Red Sea into history and attendant critique of Eurocentrism. Contrapuntally, he explores how the world and the sea were imagined differently before imperial European hegemony. Searching for the lost space of Ottoman visions of the sea,
      The Red Seamakes a deeper argument about the discipline of history and the historian's craft.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1bmzkq4">Symposium of the Whole</a><br>
  Author(s) SENGHOR LÉOPOLD SÉDAR<br>
  Abstract: Emerging from the Negritude movement of the 1930s (see above, p. 52), Senghor became the first and long-reigning president of Senegal from the time of its independence in 1960. His poetics drew from a base in African oral tradition, illuminated by and in turn illuminating the explorations of European Surrealism, etc. For the ʺsurreal imageʺ per se, the reader might turn to Pierre Reverdyʹs classic ʺdefinition,ʺ circa 1918, often cited by the French Surrealists:<br>

  Writing in the Imagination of an Oral Poet from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1bmzkq4">Symposium of the Whole</a><br>
  Author(s) MUNN HENRY<br>
  Abstract: The following essay by Henry Munn presents a necessary complication of the ʺoralityʺ issue in ethnopoetics (see above, passim)—the location of a concept of ʺbookʺ and ʺwritingʺ at center of the genuine ethnopoetics of a major oral poet (see above, p. 187). The interested reader can relate it to the proposal of an archécriture (or primal writing)—the idea of writing itself as, in David Antinʹs term, a ʺnatural genreʺ co-equal with speech, etc.—presented in the workings of such a contemporary philosopher as Jacques Derrida (see above, p. 139).

  Book Title: Lectura Dantis-Purgatorio, A Canto-by-Canto Commentary<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSS CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: This new critical volume, the second to appear in the three-volume
      Lectura Dantis,contains expert, focused commentary on thePurgatorioby thirty-three international scholars, each of whom presents to the nonspecialist reader one of the cantos of the transitional middle cantica of Dante's unique Christian epic. The cast of characters is as colorful as before, although this time most of them are headed for salvation. The canto-by-canto commentary allows each contributor his or her individual voice and results in a deeper, richer awareness of Dante's timeless aspirations and achievements.<br>

  CANTO VIII  In the Valley of the Rulers from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) QUINONES RICARDO J.<br>
  Abstract: The
                  Purgatoriowas one of the great discoveries of the twentieth century. The post-Napoleonic nineteenth century not only was preoccupied with but also identified with the overwhelming, larger-than-life personalities that impose themselves on us from within the pages of theInferno.Twentieth-century readers, traumatized and chastened by two world wars, were not in a position to gain much pleasure from doomed, heroic personalities, but they did find much to identify with in thePurgatorio,particularly in its mixed condition of sadness and of hope, its remarkable elegiac lyricism and strong personal conviction, its structural polyphonism, and its delicate interweaving of<br>

  CANTO XVI  A World of Darkness and Disorder from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) SCOTT JOHN<br>
  Abstract: The opening words of Canto XVI,
                  Buio d’Inferno(Darkness of Hell), challenge the reader’s attention with the plosive force of the initialBand the unexpected backward glance to thetenebraeof Hell. In contrast to the beauty of the seascape on the shores of Mount Purgatory, illuminated by Venus, “ the lovely planet that is patroness / of love,” and the four stars seen only by Adam and Eve (Purg.I, 13–25), the terrace of Wrath plunges us into Erebus, its smoke thicker than any “Darkness of Hell” and darker than “night deprived / of every planet” (1–<br>

  CANTO XVIII  Love, Free Will, and Sloth from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) MIGIEL MARILYN<br>
  Abstract: Many readers have been inclined to pass quickly over Canto XVIII, thinking its philosophical discussion of love and free will to be of little importance and finding no particularly significant character or event. To such readers, the philosophical discussion may appear repetitive of Marco Lombardo’s statements on free will and the soul in Canto XVI; moreover, there is nothing in Canto XVIII to match Marco’s engaging image of the

  CANTO XIX  Vectors of Human Love from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) STURM-MADDOX SARA<br>
  Abstract: Canto XIX of the
                  Purgatoriohas not been among the most favored in terms of its readers’ attention. A survey of its critical history reveals, moreover, that readers have been attracted largely by one element, that of the dream of the siren with which the canto begins. The account of the pilgrim’s dream, however, occupies only nine tercets, or twenty-seven verses out of a total of 145. Even if we include in the episode the two introductory tercets that afford a temporal orientation, as well as the dreamer’s awakening to Virgil’s call and the latter’s explanation of the dream experience,<br>

  CANTO XXVI  The Fires of Lust and Poetry from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) SHAW PRUE<br>
  Abstract: No canto of the
                  Comedyhas compelled the imagination of twentieth-century English-speaking poets more powerfully than Canto XXVI of thePurgatorio.When T.S. Eliot added his famous dedication to the second English edition ofThe Waste Land,echoing line 117 (“miglior fabbro”) of our canto and making it an obligatory point of reference for any literate English reader, he not only paid his friend and fellow poet Ezra Pound an exquisite compliment, he also completed what, in hindsight, seems a necessary trajectory. The closing line of Canto XXVI (“Poi s’ascose nel foco che li affina”; “Then, in the fire that<br>

  CANTO XXIX  Dante’s Processional Vision from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) ARMOUR PETER<br>
  Abstract: To the modern reader this canto might seem at first to be of a somewhat remote and antiquarian interest with, at best, a certain formal and old-fashioned poetic beauty. Coming immediately after the richly textured account of humankind’s lost paradise on earth and of the beautiful lady who explains it to Dante, Canto XXIX introduces a series of symbols from which the reader is required to deduce a corresponding series of “other meanings.” It would appear, therefore, to belong to that outmoded form, the allegory, and indeed virtually all commentators agree that it is an allegorical presentation of the history<br>

  Book Title: Imagining Karma-Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): OBEYESEKERE GANANATH<br>
  Abstract: With
      Imagining Karma,Gananath Obeyesekere embarks on the very first comparison of rebirth concepts across a wide range of cultures. Exploring in rich detail the beliefs of small-scale societies of West Africa, Melanesia, traditional Siberia, Canada, and the northwest coast of North America, Obeyesekere compares their ideas with those of the ancient and modern Indic civilizations and with the Greek rebirth theories of Pythagoras, Empedocles, Pindar, and Plato. His groundbreaking and authoritative discussion decenters the popular notion that India was the origin and locus of ideas of rebirth. As Obeyesekere compares responses to the most fundamental questions of human existence, he challenges readers to reexamine accepted ideas about death, cosmology, morality, and eschatology. Obeyesekere's comprehensive inquiry shows that diverse societies have come through independent invention or borrowing to believe in reincarnation as an integral part of their larger cosmological systems. The author brings together into a coherent methodological framework the thought of such diverse thinkers as Weber, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche. In a contemporary intellectual context that celebrates difference and cultural relativism, this book makes a case for disciplined comparison, a humane view of human nature, and a theoretical understanding of "family resemblances" and differences across great cultural divides.<br>

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

  Author(s) WARNKE GEORGIA<br>
  Abstract: Richard Posner lists several reasons to think that morality and law are enterprises distinct from literature: the fact that the heinous actions of German lawyers and citizens in the 1930s and 1940s coexisted with Germany’s status as one of the most cultured nations of the world; the circumstance that one of the well-known abilities of many well-read people is to remain insensitive to the suffering of others; the fact that moral atrocities fill the literary canon without affecting either the aesthetic virtues of the work or its reader’s own moral attitudes; and, finally, the distance between the concerns of law<br>

  Chapter 12  On the Politics of Gadamerian Hermeneutics: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp75p">Gadamer’s Repercussions</a><br>
  Author(s) ZUCKERT CATHERINE H.<br>
  Abstract: In “The Art of Allusion: Hans-Georg Gadamer’s Philosophical Interventions under National Socialism,” Teresa Orozco accuses Gadamer of having written “Plato and the Poets” to justify Nazi suppression of liberal humanist education and “Plato’s Educational State” to support national conservative efforts to reform the regime. Geoffrey Waite repeats her accusation in “Radio Nietzsche.” Whereas most twentieth-century readers of Nietzsche have unintentionally fostered his elitist politics by adopting a perspectivist reading, Waite charges, Orozco shows that Gadamer did so intentionally. In my view, there is little evidence to support either charge.<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Baba Tatsui: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppt3b">Reconfiguring Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: Torn between antinomies, the life of Baba Tatsui (1850–88) bears a Romantic aspect. Indeed, given Baba’s early, lonely death in a strange land (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), his biographers have seldom resisted the trope of Romantic tragedy in describing his turbulent career and sad demise. Nakae Chōmin’s touching reminiscence of his friend and fellow Jiyūtō (Liberal Party) member begins by evoking Baba’s death in the “Meriken” hospital.¹ Yasunaga Gōro starts his rather hagiographic narrative at Baba’s tall grave marker in the Woodlands Cemetery.² The opening pages of Hagihara Nobutoshi’s 1967 biography continue this convention, inviting the reader to imagine Baba’s almost<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppvzv">Transpacific Displacement</a><br>
  Abstract: What I have described as transpacific displacement is a historical process of dislocation and relocation of cultural meanings via ethnography, translation, and intertextual travel. Interestingly, this complicated cross-over, of which Imagism’s appropriation and reinvention of “Chinese” poetics constitute an important part, now seems to have taken an unexpected turn: readers of contemporary Chinese poetry have been told that the work in front of them is influenced, inspired by Imagism. As the story goes, Chinese poets, such as Bei Dao and Gu Cheng, living in the poetic wasteland of the Cultural Revolution, turned to Western literature for inspiration. The books circulated<br>

Surbakti, the news was carried by Selamat Ginting and his friends when they came to collect the buried guns of Juma Pali. In an exuberant rush of movement and emotion, Surbakti’s (1978:34) account draws the reader into the action as their 1938 Ford coupé convertible speeds back toward the city, loaded now with the disinterred Japanese guns: “Their spirits seethed with joy, as if no power on earth could oppose them.” When a policeman stops the car<br>

This chapter is written with the object of deepening their appreciation of the rich tapestry of the Australian historical novel.

  Abstract: Australian historical fiction tends to fall into some dominant categories, reflecting perennial themes that are forever being reinterpreted: first settlement, European inland exploration, pastoralism, conflict with Indigenous Australians, patriotism and war are common themes of Australian historical fiction. In writing these novels and responding to these themes, among other things, novelists inform readers much about how Australians think of themselves and of how they perceive the Australian nation. Novels often challenge conventional values in these respects. Certainly, they offer engaging insights for students into Australian history.<br>

  Abstract: Scholarly periodicals are important pacemakers and trendsetters in the process of academic professionalization and institutionalization: they not only reflect developments within scientific disciplines or their relationship to other scientific fields, they also influence such developments decisively by way of an active editorial policy.¹ Already in the course of the eighteenth century many journals dealing with ‘historical’ issues had been founded, i.e., treating genealogical, numismatic, and statistical contents.² Most of them were media of education which intended to spread and discuss established ideas within a circle of educated readers.³ At that time and also during the early years of the nineteenth<br>

                  gibbôr heḥāyil– ננדד דדל) (Judg. 6:12).¹ With these words, the messenger identified Gideon as a member of an elite class wielding extensive military, political, and economic power. The messenger did not address Gideon as a religious leader or identify him as a magistrate. Had the messenger been a modern political scientist, not a peripatetic prophet, he might have called Gideon a patrimonial leader or patron.

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Abstract: That is the philosopher Stanley Cavell writing about the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Cavell will himself be shepherded back in Chapters 4 and 5; philosopherreader Emmanuel Levinas, however, is this chapter’s explicit focus. Previous chapters have staged sonorities between Levinas and Said, Henry Darger and Pascal, Sebald and Michael Arad. The dialogism on display in this chapter, by contrast, depends on the way a given text solicits on its own or dialogically affiliates with, another—a proximate shepherding, let us call it.<br>

  3  Wittgenstein: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287hgz">Ostension</a><br>
  Abstract: When G. E. Moore wished to refute skepticism about the existence of the external world, he proved the existence of two hands as follows: “By holding up my two hands, and saying, as I make a certain gesture with the right hand, ‘Here is one hand’, and adding, as I make a certain gesture with the left, ‘and here is another.’”² Moore thought the proof worked because he knew that the premise was true. As readers of Wittgenstein’s
                  On Certaintyare aware, Moore’s use of the word “know” greatly troubles Wittgenstein. In thinking it through, Wittgenstein realizes that a skeptic<br>

  Author(s) Smith Mark S.<br>
  Abstract: Is Gen 1 a myth? The answer to this question depends on what one thinks a myth is and also on what one think about Gen 1. For believers in the Bible, the answer is, of course not. For many readers of the Bible, the idea of biblical stories as myths became a critical issue because of the discovery of tablets with stories from ancient Mesopotamia. For centuries, the Bible was considered the word of God, but texts emerging from excavations in Mesopotamia challenged the idea of the Bible as unique.

  Abstract: In this first extensive Jungian treatment of Milton's major poems, James P. Driscoll uses archetypal psychology to explore Milton's great themes of God, man, woman, and evil and offers readers deepened understanding of Jung's profound thoughts on Godhead. The Father, the Son, Satan, Messiah, Samson, Adam, and Eve gain new dimensions of meaning as their stories become epiphanies of the archetypes of Godhead.<br>

  2  The Shadow of God from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hsq3">The Unfolding God of Jung and Milton</a><br>
  Abstract: Many of the difficulties modern readers experience with
                     Paradise Lostare reactions to one character, God the Father. The Father, defending himself and combating Satan, often resembles a flawed human being. Consequently, to presume, as the narrator frequently does, that he manifests supreme goodness seems a mockery of truth. Offended, moderns may retort that, far from being supremely good and deserving worship, the Father deserves to be repudiated as evil. Jung's analytical psychology, however, offers a more refined perception, which promotes a more balanced response.<br>

  Book Title: The Shriek of Silence-A Phenomenology of the Holocaust Novel<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): PATTERSON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The Shriek of Silenceis a first in several respects: the first to examine the Holocaust novels in their original languages, the first to articulate a theoretical basis for its approach, and the first phenomenological investigation -- one that attempts to penetrate the process of creation for these novelists. Organized along conceptual lines, the book examines "the word in exile," the themes of death of the father and the child, transformations of the self, and the implications of the reader. Its philosophical foundations are Rosenzweig, Buber, Neher, and Levinas. Its critical approach is shaped by Bakhtin.<br>

  Abstract: In

This statement describes what we have called a phenomenological approach to the novel as an event. Examining what occurs in the process of the novel’s creation, we deal not only with author and character but<br>

  1  Senses of Place: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jbjp">Passage to the Center</a><br>
  Abstract: In “Place, Pastness, Poems,” Seamus Heaney quotes this passage from T.S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding” to support his view that in lieu of a cultural center the literary tradition is what links “the private experience of a poet to the usual life of the age.”¹ For Heaney, tradition allows the regional poet to affirm the centrality of local experience to his own being, but with the hope of making that experience accessible to readers from wholly different walks of life. Ideally, by raising private experience to the level of cultural expression, Heaney would have tradition transform personal memory into cultural memory.<br>

  Abstract: “Without needing to be theoretically instructed, consciousness quickly realizes that it is the site of variously contending discourses,” Heaney remarked in
                  Crediting Poetry(13). Within the context of his Nobel lecture, Seamus Heaney’s observation reminds the reader that even the apparent innocence of childhood is in fact nothing less than a school “for the complexities of his adult predicament.” In a profound sense, Heaney’s insight at once harkens back to the narrow limits of his first world, as well as the nexus of forces that constitutes its ground. At the same time, it illuminates Heaney’s artistic passage beyond his home,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: Jaime Gil de Biedma’s poems come across on first reading as clear and “realistic.” Many of them comprise detailed evocations of specific episodes, narrated by a first-person speaker who gives commentaries and conclusions. Quite often these commentaries offer philosophic insights; at times, especially in the later books, they contain social or political ideas. All of this has led some critics to characterize Gil de Biedma as a realistic poet proccupied with ethical and social issues.¹ The very clarity of his work has caused readers to miss its depth and originality.<br>

  Author(s) Whitmarsh Tim<br>
  Abstract: The beginning of Heliodorus’ novel is justly famous. The lavish visuality, which has invited numerous comparisons with cinematic technique,³ inaugurates a narrative that makes sustained and creative use of the spectacular.⁴ The deployment of the bandits as aporetic focalisers for the scene they behold is a stroke of narratological brilliance, artfully retarding the reader’s cognition of events with a drip-drip release of information.⁵ Heliodorus, the latest of antiquity’s extant novelists, announces with a bang his arrival in a crowded, and to some extent overly regularised, marketplace: while the title of the papyrus or codex (τά περὶ Θεαγένην καὶ Χαρίκλειαν Αἰθιοπικά)<br>

  Author(s) Harrison Stephen<br>
  Abstract: It is a commonplace of modern scholarship on the
                  Metamorphosesof Apuleius that the deployment of elements from Greek and Roman epic, easily recognisable by the cultured bilingual elite reader of the high Roman Empire, plays a crucial role in the literary self-definition and reception of Apuleius’ novel.² On the one hand, the appearance of such features suggests that the novel shows a significant similarity to epic in literary ambition; on the other hand, the comic or parodic manner in which such features are often treated serves to maintain a suitable generic distance between lofty epic poetry and prose fiction,<br>

  Abstract: The Catholic Studies Reader is a rare book in an emerging field that has neither a documented history nor a consensus as to what should be a normative methodology. Dividing this volume into five interrelated themes central to the practice and theory of Catholic Studies-Sources and Contexts, Traditions and Methods, Pedagogy and Practice, Ethnicity, Race, and Catholic Studies, and The Catholic Imagination-the editors provide readers with the opportunity to understand the great diversity within this area of study. Readers will find informative essays on the Catholic intellectual tradition and Catholic social teaching, as well as reflections on the arts and literature. This provocative and enriching collection is valuable not only for scholars but also for lay and religious Catholics working in Catholic education in universities, high schools, and parish schools.<br>

  Author(s) Dooley Mark<br>
  Abstract: The essay that best encapsulates the recent thought of Jean-Luc Marion is, in my opinion, “The Saturated Phenomenon” (SP). Here the author gives an account of what he calls the paradox of an “impossible” phenomenon, one that bedazzles the ego through an excess of intuition over intention. Although this idea has generated a good deal of fairly robust criticism,¹ most of the essay’s readers are nevertheless impressed by the way in which Marion uses it not only to enlarge upon the project of

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Another Cosmopolitanism, Seyla Benhabib promotes the idea that recent developments in international institutionalism evidence the growth of what she calls cosmopolitan norms.¹ She turns to an emergency to set the stage. Genocide serves as her synecdoche for several new legislative and normative trends in human rights, especially in Europe. Noting the lack of appropriate institutions with which to try Adolf Eichmann in 1961, Benhabib presses upon her readers the need to support international tribunals now. But the lens and mood set by Eichmann and genocide set us up to relate in a certain way—in a mode of dependence<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  Phallomorphic Exposure: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x01nw">Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination</a><br>
  Abstract: As I intimated in the preceding chapter, the project of reshaping the feminine in contemporary liturgical discourse—and thereby destabilizing the male-centered symbolic that has dominated Judaism—can proceed without relying on philological and historical research, but the re/envisioning is proportionately impoverished to the degree that it neglects or obfuscates the tradition it purports to reflect. I am not so naïve as to ignore the fact that shared existential circumstances impact the reader’s interpretative stance. On the contrary, I readily acknowledge that the reader is prejudiced by hermeneutical assumptions that mirror a complex web of factors ranging from the socioeconomic<br>

  Book Title: For Derrida-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller J. Hillis<br>
  Abstract: This book-the culmination of forty years of friendship between J. Hillis Miller and Jacques Derrida, during which Miller also closely followed all Derrida's writings and seminars-is for Derridain two senses. It is for him,dedicated to his memory. The chapters also speak, in acts of reading, as advocates for Derrida's work. They focus especially on Derrida's late work, including passages from the last, as yet unpublished, seminars. The chapters are partial to Derrida,on his side, taking his part, gratefully submitting themselves to the demand made by Derrida's writings to be read-slowly, carefully, faithfully, with close attention to semantic detail.The chapters do not progress forward to tell a sequential story. They are, rather, a series of perspectives on the heterogeneity of Derrida's work, or forays into that heterogeneity.The chief goal has been, to borrow a phrase from Wallace Stevens, plainly to propoundwhat Derrida says. The book aims, above all, to render Derrida's writings justice. It should be remembered, however, that, according to Derrida himself, every rendering of justice is also a transformative interpretation. A book like this one is not a substitute for reading Derrida for oneself. It is to be hoped that it will encourage readers to do just that.<br>

  Abstract: At the opening of Book 3 of Saint Augustine’s

Yet the ultimate object of his desire, in these years when he indulges in theater and prays for chastity to come at some more convenient time, is neither theatrical nor narrowly sexual—nor is it God, who might have been the reader’s first suspicion. “I was in love with love,” Augustine writes, though he adds that he is a bit confused about what “love” might mean.<br>

  Author(s) KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: The Song of Songs offers no single, stable perspective from which to view the amorous scenes unveiled on its pages. Most readers of the Song from antiquity to the present have, however, been inclined to identify with the female figure traditionally known as the Shulammite. But who is the Shulammite, and who, for that matter, is her beloved? The sustained ambiguities of identity and fluid reversals of erotic roles have made this text fertile ground for conceiving and reconceiving the mysteries of desire, in particular, the mysteries of

  Book Title: Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stahlberg Lesleigh Cushing<br>
  Abstract: Scrolls of Love is a book of unions. Edited by a Jew and a Christian who are united by a shared passion for the Bible and a common literary hermeneutic, it joins two biblical scrolls and gathers around them a diverse community of interpreters. It brings together Ruth and the Song of Songs, two seemingly disparate texts of the Hebrew Bible, and reads them through a number of the methodological and theological perspectives. Respectful of traditional biblical scholarship, the collection of essays moves beyond it; alert to contemporary trends, the volume returns venerable interpretive tradition to center stage. Most significantly, it is interfaith. Despite the fact that Jews and Christians share a common text in the Hebrew Scripture, the two communities have read their Bibles in isolation from one another, in ignorance of the richness of the other's traditions of reading. Scrolls of Love brings the two traditions into dialogue, enriching established modes of interpretation with unconventional ones. The result is a volume that sets rabbinic, patristic, and medieval readings alongside feminist, psychoanalytic, and autobiographical ones, combining historical, literary, and textual criticism with a variety of artistic reinterpretations-wood cuts and paper cuts, poetry and fiction. Some of the works are scholarly, with the requisite footnotes to draw readers to further inquiry: others are more reflective than analytic, allowing readers to see what it means to live intimately with Scripture. As a unity, the collection presents Ruth and Song of Songs not only as ancient texts that deserve to be treasured but as old worlds capable of begetting the new.<br>

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Book Title: Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Waldmeir John C.<br>
  Abstract: The metaphor of the Church as a bodyhas shaped Catholic thinking since the Second Vatican Council. Its influence on theological inquiries into Catholic nature and practice is well-known; less obvious is the way it has shaped a generation of Catholic imaginative writers. Cathedrals of Bone is the first full-length study of a cohort of Catholic authors whose art takes seriously the themes of the Council: from novelists such as Mary Gordon, Ron Hansen, Louise Erdrich, and J. F. Powers, to poets such as Annie Dillard, Mary Karr, Lucia Perillo, and Anne Carson, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright John Patrick Shanley. Motivated by the inspirational yet thoroughly incarnational rhetoric of Vatican II, each of these writers encourages readers to think about the human body as a site-perhaps the most important site-of interaction between God and human beings. Although they represent the body in different ways, these late-twentieth-century Catholic artists share a sense of its inherent value. Moreover, they use ideas and terminology from the rich tradition of Catholic sacramentality, especially as it was articulated in the documents of Vatican II, to describe that value. In this way they challenge the Church to take its own tradition seriously and to reconsider its relationship to a relatively recent apologetics that has emphasized a narrow view of human reason and a rigid sense of orthodoxy.<br>

  Abstract: At times, reading a classical philosophical text is like watching an ice floe break up during global warming. The compacted cold assurance of a coherent system begins to become liquid and great conceptual pieces break off before your eyes and begin to float free on the sea. To be a reader is to try and either keep one’s footing as the ice breaks up, or to fall in the icy water and drown.<br>

  Abstract: In the following chapter about allegory, irony, and despair in

Whether in art or life, readers and writers register, remember, and imitate much else in literary models besides the odd word or phrase, as I have noted in my introduction.¹ Both subtler and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0d91">Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton</a><br>
  Abstract: Like Chaucer, Spenser often finds or pretends to find in earlier books the enabling source of his own poetry, and for this reason, among others, he describes Chaucer’s writing as the wellhead of his own. A number of Spenser’s interpreters have sought the meaning of his deliberate reliance on a written tradition in pure textuality or in its effect on a community of readers.¹ While not rejecting their many valid perceptions, I want to suggest that this reliance also be referred to the claim the Spenserian poet made for it, particularly in
                  The Faerie Queene. In Spenser’s most massively allusive<br>

  6.  Spenser’s Use of Chaucer’s Melibee: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0d91">Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton</a><br>
  Abstract: In an important article on the relation of Spenser’s late lyrics to
                  The Faerie Queene, Paul Alpers is especially concerned to defend Spenser’s Melibee, the kindly old shepherd destroyed in the sixth book by marauding brigands, from other readers’ charges of laziness, carelessness, or blindness. In terms of traditional morality, Alpers seeks to defend Melibee from the charge of imprudence in the style of his life. To this end he asserts Melibee’s “parity” in Book VI with Colin Clout, Spenser’s own pastoral persona, who invokes the celebrated vision of the Muses on Mount Acidale.¹ By “parity,” Alpers means that both<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0d91">Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton</a><br>
  Abstract: Most readers would probably agree with the editors of the Spenser
                  Variorumthat “in writingMuiopotmos[: or The Fate of the Butterflie] Spenser could hardly have been unconscious of Chaucer’s mock-heroic poems, but that he was not engaged in a studied imitation of them.”¹ As evidenced inMuiopotmos, Spenser’s specific interest inThe Nun’s Priest’s Talelies somewhere between sustained allusion and incidental reminiscence; it is persistent but elusive. The relationship between these poems includes but extends beyond general similarities of genre, theme, and plot and the odd detail, such as the name of Clarion, which is likely motivated by<br>

  Abstract: In our century the words
                  antiqueandantiquitynormally have a resonance different from what they had for late sixteenth-century readers of Spenser’sFaerie Queene. For us, these words suggest not only age but also antiquation. They signal both the distance of time and that of obsolescence: while something “antique” might be valuable or quaint or interesting, it is not essentially practical or even very useful. This sense of antiquation, which registers a lack of functional relevance, is not unknown to the late sixteenth century or to Spenser, but it is novel and rare rather than usual and standard. It<br>

However, Western-based assumptions of the challenges she faces because of her racial difference are overlooked by many Japanese readers, who find Skim’s image disconcerting in the novel’s Japanese translation.

  Abstract: Thierry Groensteen argues that “the narrative techniques and processes that are used in manga give the reader the feeling of being immersed in the action, whereas Western comics create a more distant relation between the reader and the narrative” (27). It goes without saying that both “Western” and “Eastern” graphic narratives escape such generalization. However, Angela Moreno Acosta’s redrawing of one sequence from Gene Luen Yang’s American Born Chinese visualizes what has come to dominate the global image of manga, including Groensteen’s, namely the assumption that this kind of comics is particularly qualified for highlighting emotions, moods, and private interpersonal<br>

The study derives, however, from American and traditional sources as well, and is therefore, in another sense, a work of synthesis.

  Abstract: The essays contained in this volume are contributions to that intense and self-conscious assessment of the perspectives, resources, and terms by which contemporary literary criticism has sought to justify its validity, its function, and its historical legitimacy. If literature itself seems in our time to have lost its innocence, if neither its subjective nor its objective character is self-evident but demands of its readers a sharp awareness of its modality, it has by this challenge called forth a breathtaking variety of systems of critical discourse; indeed, it has created a pre-eminence of theoretical consciousness that may tend, at times, to<br>

  Abstract: Libertarians and free-market theorists routinely claim Laozi as one of their own. David Boaz, for instance, in his reader on libertarianism, features selections “from Lao-tzu to Milton Friedman,” reflecting his belief that Laozi was the “first known libertarian.”¹ Such claims are based on the perception that notions of nonintervention and spontaneity in the

  Abstract: The current proliferation of sequels in both literary and cinematic venues suggests an abiding interest in stories that follow up on and expand previously circulated stories. Sequel novels are written, published, and read for many different reasons, the most commonly expressed being a desire by the reader for repetition, but with difference; a wish by the author to explore in more detail a character or situation from a previous book; and a need expressed by the author or publisher, or both, to continue an economically successful venture. One of the most oftquoted commentaries on sequels is Terry Castle’s 1986 study<br>

  10  Interpreting with Pragmatist Intentions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bs87q">Intention Interpretation</a><br>
  Author(s) SHUSTERMAN RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: At least three different and influential theories of interpretation claim to be pragmatist. Knapp and Michaels’s theory is rigidly intentionalistic and author bound, while Richard Rorty’s contrastingly emphasizes the production of nonauthorial readings. The third, advanced by Stanley Fish, submits (and dissolves) both author and reader to the notion of the interpretive community as the authority determining the proper meaning of a text. In this essay I investigate two of these rival theories, examining them in the light of more general pragmatist principles. The purpose of this exercise is not to award a prize for the most authentically pragmatist theory<br>

  Abstract: This chapter discusses theological foundations for knowledge of God. Our approach emphasizes the conversion of the theologian and builds on previous chapters by illustrating how a theologian’s fourfold conversion determines the horizon within which discourse about God becomes meaningful. The chapter begins by identifying the main lines or themes of several major conversations about knowledge of God in the history of philosophy and theology. In this way, the reader may gain a sense of how our discussion of foundations allows us to revisit classic themes or questions about God.<br>

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

  Abstract: As was demonstrated in the last chapter, the parables of Jesus are texts that can be considered from three different perspectives. First, they are historical texts that arose in a particular time and cultural space and that are part of a history of tradition. Second, they are fictional texts that have a typical form and poetic style and that use literary devices. Third, they are texts notably addressed to their recipients, their hearers and readers, in order to evoke a process of thinking and rethinking that ultimately leads to deeper insights and even corresponding (re-)action. In order to understand parables,<br>

  Abstract: Parables speak to us. They draw the reader into their narrated world by means of their narrative style, their proximity to reality, and in particular, their figurativeness. Parables need a reader in order to be interpreted and understood. The meaning of a parable cannot simply be captured absolutely in and of itself. Instead, parables require the process of reading, that is, the reception.<br>

  Abstract: In the second part of this book, I provide some examples of parable interpretation. In doing so I take up the historical, literary, and reader-oriented aspects that have been explored in the first part of this monograph. The different perspectives on how one is to approach the parables will be brought together to form an integrative method of parable analysis. Accordingly, the first chapter within this section offers a methodological guideline for how to do parable interpretation, which can be applied to every parable in early Christianity and beyond. I provide one example of parable exegesis in each main source<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j3m5">The Wisdom and Foolishness of God</a><br>
  Author(s) Plaxco Kellen<br>
  Abstract: Late-modern questions and concerns lead Paul’s readers to suppose that Paul’s opposition of “wisdom” to “folly” is the lens for focusing Paul’s meaning.¹ Just so, the best reading of Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians is the reading that best interprets that opposition’s dissonance as the center of Paul’s thought.² It is not as though Paul does not oppose cruciform folly to worldly wisdom. Any exegete must acknowledge Paul’s playful polarities of wisdom and folly, power and weakness, and so on. But it is not a foregone conclusion that this opposition forms the core of Paul’s theology in 1 Corinthians<br>

  Book Title: Acceptable words-Essays on the poetry of Geoffrey Hill<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAINWRIGHT JEFFREY<br>
  Abstract: Geoffrey Hill has said that some great poetry 'recognises that words fail us'. These essays explore Hill's struggle over fifty years with the recalcitrance of language. This book seeks to show how all his work is marked by the quest for the right pitch of utterance whether it is sorrowing, angry, satiric or erotic. It shows how Hill's words are never lightly 'acceptable' but an ethical act, how he seeks out words he can stand by - words that are 'getting it right'. This book is the most comprehensive and up-to-date critical work on Geoffrey Hill so far, covering all his work up to ‘Scenes from Comus’ (2005), as well as some poems yet to appear in book form. It aims to contribute something to the understanding of his poetry among those who have followed it for many years and students and other readers encountering this major poet for the first time.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j67x">Acceptable words</a><br>
  Abstract: After the long, shifting account of Charles Péguy in Hill’s poem, what are we to take from him? What sense is to be made, for what will he, who ‘commends us to nothing’, serve? The concluding moment of the poem is when we expect summary, a considered gesture, at least the ceremony of closure even though it might resemble stiffened custom and a bellowing ‘with hoarse dignity into the wind’. Hill’s tone, directed at his own contemplation as well as that of the reader, concedes little. ‘Take that for example!’ mingles defiance, the clean blow, with surly dismissal.<br>

  Book Title: Douglas Coupland-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tate Andrew<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first full-length study of Douglas Coupland, one of the twenty-first century’s most innovative and influential novelists. The study explores the prolific first decade and a half of Coupland’s career, from Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture (1991) to JPod (2006), a period in which he published ten novels and four significant volumes of non-fiction. Emerging in the last decade of the twentieth century - amidst the absurd contradictions of instantaneous global communication and acute poverty - Coupland’s novels, short stories, essays and visual art have intervened in specifically contemporary debates regarding authenticity, artifice and art. This book explores Coupland’s response, in ground-breaking novels such as Microserfs, Girlfriend in a Coma and Miss Wyoming, to some of the most pressing issues of our times. Designed for students, researchers and general readers alike, the study is structured around thematically focused chapters that consider Coupland’s engagement with narrative, consumer culture, space, religion and ideas of the future.<br>

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  Abstract: To latter-day readers and critics, the early works of any established writer undoubtedly hold a special kind of attraction. Do their first forays into fiction ‘reveal’, as Kuno Schuhmann (2001: 75) puts it, ‘a personality that may be more carefully hidden in later texts? Does the first shaping of themes throw additional light on the later novels?’ In relation to A. S. Byatt’s early work, Kathleen Coyne Kelly (1996: 14), in her monograph on the author, provides at least a partial answer to these questions when she remarks that ‘[w]hile Byatt’s art has certainly matured over the past thirty years,<br>

Those who had expected another meditative study of life in 1950s Yorkshire were either bemused or delighted to discover that a strange and colourful new hybrid – part contemporary campus comedy, part historical romance, part literary detective story – had been added to Byatt’s oeuvre. By 1990, Byatt had gained a reputation as a traditional, academically minded novelist, whose work embodied a Leavisite vision of English culture and Arnoldian standards of ‘high seriousness’.<br>

And yet, not all of Byatt’s tales prove a liberating force for good. Indeed, Byatt also often chooses to foreground the darker side of the storytelling imagination – the part which is concerned, to quote Rifat Orhan from ‘The Djinn in the Nightingale’s Eye’, ‘with Fate, with Destiny, with what is prepared for human beings’ (

  Book Title: Women’s writing in contemporary France-New writers, new literatures in the 1990s<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WORTON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The 1990s witnessed an explosion in women’s writing in France, with a particularly exciting new generation of writer’s coming to the fore, such as Christine Angot, Marie Darrieussecq and Regine Detambel. Other authors such as Paule Constant, Sylvie Germain, Marie Redonnet and Leila Sebbar, who had begun publishing in the 1980s, claimed their mainstream status in the 1990s with new texts. The book provides an up-to-date introduction to an analysis of new women’s writing in contemporary France, including both new writers of the 1990s and their more established counter-parts. The editors’ incisive introduction situates these authors and their texts at the centre of the current trends and issues concerning French literary production today, whilst fifteen original essays focus on individual writers. The volume includes specialist bibliographies on each writer, incorporating English translations, major interviews, and key critical studies. Quotations are given in both French and English throughout. An invaluable study resource, this book is written in a clear and accessible style and will be of interest to the general reader as well as to students of all levels, to teachers of a wide range of courses on French culture, and to specialist researchers of French and Francophone literature.<br>

                  Truismesexploded on to the French literary scene it was clear that she was a young writer intent on taking the reader to disturbing places.¹ Set in a partially recognisable, dystopic France of the near future, this erotic, funny and inventive novel satirises right-wing extremism, repressive state mechanisms, new-age fanaticisms and political correctness gone mad. Its primary focus on gender and body politics is provocatively inflected by Darrieussecq’s choice of narrator – a young woman who metamorphoses into a sow – and the novel reveals the author’s penchant for probing the frontiers between the everyday and the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jht2">Jonathan Lethem</a><br>
  Abstract: So far it has been argued that there is a high degree of correspondence between form and content in Lethem’s work, and that the genre decisions he makes are integral to his view of the world as a series of semi-imagined subcultural groupings or, to reprise Rick Altman’s term,
                  ‘constellated communities’(Altman, 1999: 161). In the eccentric family unit formed at the end ofAmnesia Moonand in Alice Coombs’ parallel campus world, one sees a yearning for workable mini-utopias congruent with the implicit (and sometimes explicit) ties formed between readers of genre fiction.

  Author(s) Zachman Randall C.<br>
  Abstract: John Calvin (1509–1564) was born in Noyon, France, and studied law at Orleans and Bourges. During his legal studies, Calvin also developed a love of Latin and Greek classical literature. After his sudden conversion to the evangelical movement started by Martin Luther, Calvin used his skill in languages to teach doctrine and interpret scripture for the evangelicals in France. Calvin was called to be a reader of scripture and pastor in Geneva in 1536. He and his colleague Guiaumme Farel were expelled from Geneva in 1538, and Calvin spent the next three years in Strasbourg, where he taught in<br>

  8  Jesus Taught in Parables from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jm7q">Jesus the Central Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: What is a parable? It is a short story characterized by verisimilitude and conveying a lesson, usually moral. A parable is, in Hebrew terms, a haggadic or midrashic
                  mashal. The whole of Jewish tradition is bidimensional; it is built into the halakah (legal dispositions) and the haggadah (paradigmatic stories illustrating the meaning, impact, and relevance of a biblical theme or text). Historically, it must be said that preference has been given by Jewish readers to the halakic side of the tradition because of its obvious bearing on ways of life according to the divine order.

  Book Title: The Secret Life of Stories-From Don Quixote to Harry Potter, How Understanding Intellectual Disability Transforms the Way We Read<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Bérubé Michael<br>
  Abstract: In
      The Secret Life of Stories, Michael Bérubé tells a dramatically different tale, in a compelling account of how an understanding of intellectual disability can transform our understanding of narrative. Instead of focusing on characters with disabilities, he shows how ideas about intellectual disability inform an astonishingly wide array of narrative strategies, providing a new and startling way of thinking through questions of time, self-reflexivity, and motive in the experience of reading. Interweaving his own stories with readings of such texts as Faulkner'sThe Sound and the Fury, Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Kingston'sThe Woman Warrior, and Philip K. Dick'sMartian Time-Slip, Bérubé puts his theory into practice, stretching the purview of the study of literature and the role of disability studies within it. Armed only with the tools of close reading, Bérubé demonstrates the immensely generative possibilities in the ways disability is deployed within fiction, finding in them powerful meditations on what it means to be a social being, a sentient creature with an awareness of mortality and causality-and sentience itself. Persuasive and witty, Michael Bérubé engages Harry Potter fans and scholars of literature alike. For all readers,The Secret Life of Storieswill fundamentally change the way we think about the way we read.<br>

  Abstract: Literary texts have any number of ways of marking their awareness of themselves as literary texts. Some are cloying; some are trivial; some are merely cute. Some involve explicitly metafictional engagements with the fictionality of fiction, as in the closing passage of Beckett’s
                  Molloy, echoing and complicating the opening passage of the novella’s second section: “Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining” (176). Some involve more subtle, implicit meditations on the degree of readerly self-consciousness necessary for reading, as in<br>

  Abstract: The terms ‘righteous’ and ‘righteousness’ do not occur in the book of Joshua and, after reading its stories of the conquest, one could be forgiven for concluding ‘with good reason’. To a modern reader the divine command to utterly destroy another nation smacks of ‘ ethnic cleansing’ or genocide. Nevertheless, if one takes the literary and theological context of the larger Hebrew Bible/Old Testament into account, as well as its ANE context, some appreciation can be gained of the presence of such stories and their contribution to the theology of divine righteousness.<br>

  Abstract: David Clines, who recently completed a massive three–volume commentary on Job, thinks most readers would see ‘the major question’ of the book as the problem of (innocent) suffering. However Clines himself thinks that it is the ‘moral order of the world, of the principles on which it is governed’ by the divinity.¹ The two views are in fact related because the reality of innocent suffering questions in what sense, or whether in any sense, God’s governance of creation can be called just.

  Abstract: In

According to Iser, the ‘implied reader’ cannot be located within the text or even outside of the text in actual readers, but must be found in the ‘interaction between text and reader’.² In this interaction, ‘text’ and ‘reader’<br>

  Abstract: Paul’s argument in his discussion of the new covenant in 2 Corinthians 3 is difficult for any reader. A steady stream of articles and monographs on various features of the chapter bear eloquent testimony to its difficulty.¹ The flow of Paul’s argument is not immediately transparent. ‘It seems as though the obscurity of this passage is impenetrable and that the commentaries lead us to the conclusion: “so many men, so many minds”.’² Letters written with ink on parchment—letters of recommendation (2 Cor 3:1)—morph into the letters of the law engraved on stone tablets (verse 3).

They take the place of an index of subjects at the end of the book which, in a book like this, would be unwieldy and unhelpful. The summaries should help a reader find what they want to read and avoid what they don’t want to. If bogged down in reading a piece, the summary may help answer the question: what on earth am I doing reading this? Placed separately, current thinking does not contaminate past thought.

The issue of story or history, of story or report, is form-critically extremely challenging and theologically extremely important. As any reader of Mark O’Brien and my recent

  Book Title: Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sitze Adam<br>
  Abstract: In this fascinating and rare little book, a leading Italian feminist philosopher and the Archbishop of Milan face off over the contemporary meaning of the biblical commandment not to kill. The result is a series of erudite and wide-ranging arguments that move from murder and suicide to just war and drone strikes, from bioethics and biopolitics to hermeneutics and philology, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, from Torah and Scripture to art and literature, from the essence of human dignity and the paradoxes of fratricide to engagements with Levinasian ethics. Less a direct debate than a disputation in the classical sense, Thou Shalt Not Kill proves to be a searching meditation on one of the unstated moral premises shared by otherwise bitterly opposed political factions. It will stimulate the mind of the novice while also reminding more advanced readers of the necessity and desirability of thinking in the present.<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dwyer Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Encountering Morocco introduces readers to life in this North African country through vivid accounts of fieldwork as personal experience and intellectual journey. We meet the contributors at diverse stages of their careers-from the unmarried researcher arriving for her first stint in the field to the seasoned fieldworker returning with spouse and children. They offer frank descriptions of what it means to take up residence in a place where one is regarded as an outsider, learn the language and local customs, and struggle to develop rapport. Moving reflections on friendship, kinship, and belief within the cross-cultural encounter reveal why study of Moroccan society has played such a seminal role in the development of cultural anthropology.<br>

  Author(s) NEWCOMB RACHEL<br>
  Abstract: This book introduces readers to Morocco by showing how anthropologists have come to understand it. Each essay takes us into a specific part of the country through the unique voice of the writer. Each delivers a very local story, a vignette of how a particular individual has done fieldwork in a specific context. And each stands as a personal meditation on cross-cultural understanding, the way that one person came to appreciate an alien social world. Together the chapters build a richly textured portrait of the Kingdom of Morocco-a key site in the development of the discipline of anthropology.<br>

  FOUR  Love and Violence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz4t7">Degrees of Givenness</a><br>
  Abstract: The lover “declares his love as one declares war” (EP, 79; PE, 129). So insists Marion repeatedly in his investigation into the nature of the erotic phenomenon. War, of course, is here “only” a metaphor illustrating the absolute commitment of the lover. Yet the fact that this analogy is used several times throughout
                  The Erotic Phenomenonseems to indicate that it is not insignificant. Rather, it points to a problematic aspect of Marion’s treatment of eros, namely the extreme—if not almost militant—character of this love. And the careful reader finds the connotations of absoluteness exacerbated by another subtheme,<br>

  Abstract: Jean Godefroy Bidima's La Palabre examines the traditional African institution of palaver as a way to create dialogue and open exchange in an effort to resolve conflict and promote democracy. In the wake of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commissions and the gacaca courts in Rwanda, Bidima offers a compelling model of how to develop an African public space where dialogue can combat misunderstanding. This volume, which includes other essays on legal processes, cultural diversity, memory, and the internet in Africa, offers English-speaking readers the opportunity to become acquainted with a highly original and important postcolonial thinker.<br>

  Author(s) Houston Christopher<br>
  Abstract: What is phenomenology? And why should anthropologists, as well as students of history, psychology, education, or political economy be interested in it? Within philosophy, phenomenology is as diverse as its practitioners. Indeed, Moran (2000: 3) in an introduction to philosophical traditions of phenomenology finds it important to warn readers not to overstate the degree to which phenomenology “coheres into an agreed method, or accepts one theoretical outlook, or one set of philosophical theses about consciousness, knowledge, and the world.” Some of this diversity continues to be a feature of anthropological uses of phenomenology, as we show here.

  Book Title: The Year's Work at the Zombie Research Center-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAFFE AARON<br>
  Abstract: They have stalked the horizons of our culture, wreaked havoc on moribund concepts of dead and not dead, threatened our sense of identity, and endangered our personal safety. Now zombies have emerged from the lurking shadows of society's fringes to wander the sacred halls of the academy, feasting on tender minds and hurling rot across our intellectual landscape. It is time to unite in common cause, to shore up defenses, firm up critical and analytical resources, and fortify crumbling lines of inquiry. Responding to this call, Brain Workers from the Zombie Research Center poke and prod the rotting corpus of zombie culture trying to make sense of cult classics and the unstoppable growth of new and even more disturbing work. They exhume "zombie theory" and decaying historical documents from America, Europe, and the Caribbean in order to unearth the zombie world and arm readers with the brain tools necessary for everyday survival. Readers will see that zombie culture today "lives" in shapes as mutable as a zombie horde-and is often just as violent.<br>

  Abstract: Tristram Shandyis, at the very least, a clever and mildly salacious book. Moreover, it has the annoying trick of involving the reader, willy-nilly, in its salacities: he must grant, however unwillingly, that he knows, and that Sterne was safe in assuming he would know, what a nose is, or what “place” Mrs. Wadman has in mind. It is a disturbing book, then, for a polite age. The discomfort and irritation of the polite reader have broken out from the very beginning in invective against the alleged crudity and moral evasiveness of the book.

  Abstract: The Platonic dialogues are not treatises in disguise. They are protreptic and proleptic instruments, positioning the reader dispositionally and providing hints for the work of completing the direction of thought by attending to “the things themselves,” the phenomena to which human beings, properly attuned, have native access. Plato, I would contend, is a proto-phenomenologist whose dialogues yield significant coherent results when approached from that point of view.<br>

Plato is famous for his doctrine of Forms, of changeless eidetic features. He advises his readers, when carrying out eidetic analysis, to “carve along the joints” of what is given rather than hacking through like a<br>

  The Overrealized Expulsion in the Gospel of John from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Klink Edward W.<br>
  Abstract: When reading John 9, Martyn finds as blatantly anachronistic a key term in 9:22, ἀποσυνάγωγος (“from the synagogue”; also in 12:42 and 16:2a). Although in the narrative this term describes an event during Jesus’ earthly ministry, for Martyn (2003, 65) it is most certainly dealing with an event that could not have occurred until decades after Jesus’ life. Martyn is convinced that the first-century readers of the Fourth Gospel would have seen the “expulsion from the synagogue” term as an anachronistic insertion into the narrative. In many ways, the “expulsion from the synagogue” in 9:22 is the key to his<br>

However, Craig Carter recently wrote that “The biggest problem in Yoder interpretation arises with regard to Stanley Hauerwas.”² This is because many readers come to Yoder by way of Hauerwas and, as a consequence, impose an interpretive grid whereby the differences between the two are overlooked.<br>

  Book Title: Luther and Liberation-A Latin American Perspective<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Altmann Walter<br>
  Abstract: With the approach of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s inauguration of the Protestant Reformation and the burgeoning dialogue between Catholics and Lutherans opened under Pope Francis, this new edition of Walter Altmann’s Luther and Liberation is timely and relevant. Luther and Liberation recovers the liberating and revolutionary impact of Luther’s theology, read afresh from the perspective of the Latin American context. Altmann provides a much-needed reassessment of Luther’s significance today through a direct engagement of Luther’s historical situation with an eye keenly situated on the deeply contextual situation of the contemporary reader, giving a localized reading from the author’s own experience in Latin America. The work examines with fresh vigor Luther’s central theological commitments, such as his doctrine of God, Christology, justification, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology, and his forays into economics, politics, education, violence, and war. This new edition greatly expands the original text with fresh scholarship and updated sources, footnotes, and bibliography, and contains several additional new chapters on Luther’s doctrine of God, theology of the sacraments, his controversial perspective on the Jews, and a new comparative account with the Latin American liberation theology tradition.<br>

Beginning with the silent language of the divinatory lots, Werbner deciphers the everyday, metaphorical, and poetic language that is used to reveal their meaning. Through Werbner's skillful interpretations of the language of divination, a picture of Tswapong moral imagination is revealed. Concerns about dignity and personal illumination, witchcraft, pollution, the anger of dead ancestors, as well as the nature of life, truth, cosmic harmony, being, and becoming emerge in this charged African setting.<br>

  Abstract: The paradox of silence in literature has forever intrigued writers and philosophers. Among the many different types of silence, Beckett refers to the silence of what is being invoked indirectly, but not said explicitly, that is, the silence between phrases that we can hear in the intervals of a statement. This is a deeply literary silence not only because poetic language is generated by modes of indirection but also because, almost paradoxically, it is often this silence in the interstices of language that breathes life into literature, endowing it with the ability to engage readers with the limits of what<br>

The unorthodoxy of Wittgenstein emerges as much in his life as in his thought. For the reader unfamiliar with him, his writing<br>

  Abstract: This book is an exploration of sociological and psycho-social theories of the construction of whiteness vis-à-vis perceptions and imaginings of otherness. It has three main aims. First, to introduce the reader to the history and theoretical unfolding of contemporary studies of whiteness in North America and Europe. Second, to explore the structural facilitating factors of these constructions, through such institutions as the state and the media. Finally, the book synthesises a psycho-social perspective to look at the underlying mechanisms which fuel social exclusion and inclusion in society. Theory is never separated from practice and the book makes full use of<br>

  10  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p383">White Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: Our exploration of the themes of community and identity in provincial England is necessarily qualified. Our sample was relatively small and restricted to two cities. However, we suggest, in the light of further research, which admittedly focused on working-class respondents (Hoggett et al., 2008; Garner et al., 2009), that the discourses on community, Britishness and whiteness are generally applicable outside of some large metropolitan areas where Gilroy’s model of conviviality might be the dominant mode. The temptation for researcher and reader alike is to become absorbed into the details and start to lose track of the bigger picture. There are<br>

  Book Title: Mexico in Verse-A History of Music, Rhyme, and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): BEEZLEY WILLIAM H.<br>
  Abstract: The history of Mexico is spoken in the voice of ordinary people. In rhymed verse and mariachi song, in letters of romance and whispered words in the cantina, the heart and soul of a nation is revealed in all its intimacy and authenticity.
      Mexico in Verse, edited by Stephen Neufeld and Michael Matthews, examines Mexican history through its poetry and music, the spoken and the written word.Focusing on modern Mexico, from 1840 to the 1980s, this volume examines the cultural venues in which people articulated their understanding of the social, political, and economic change they witnessed taking place during times of tremendous upheaval, such as the Mexican-American War, the Porfiriato, and the Mexican Revolution. The words of diverse peoples-people of the street, of the field, of the cantinas-reveal the development of the modern nation. Neufeld and Matthews have chosen sources so far unexplored by Mexicanist scholars in order to investigate the ways that individuals interpreted-whether resisting or reinforcing-official narratives about formative historical moments.The contributors offer new research that reveals how different social groups interpreted and understood the Mexican experience. The collected essays cover a wide range of topics: military life, railroad accidents, religious upheaval, children's literature, alcohol consumption, and the 1985 earthquake. Each chapter provides a translated song or poem that encourages readers to participate in the interpretive practice of historical research and cultural scholarship. In this regard,Mexico in Verseserves both as a volume of collected essays and as a classroom-ready primary document reader.<br>

  Book Title: Interrogating Cultural Studies-Theory, Politics and Practice<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Bowman Paul<br>
  Abstract: This book presents an original and innovative new approach to the field of cultural studies in the form of a series of dynamically executed interviews with some of the world’s leading and some of the most challenging emergent cultural theorists, from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond: Professor Mieke Bal, Professor Catherine Belsey, Professor Steven Connor, Professor Simon Critchley, Professor Thomas Docherty, Dr Jeremy Gilbert, Professor Sue Golding, Professor Lynette Hunter, Dr Martin McQuillan, Professor John Mowitt, Professor Christopher Norris, Professor Griselda Pollock, Professor Adrian Rifkin, Professor Jeremy Valentine, Professor Julian Wolfreys, and Professor Slavoj Zizek are all included here. The book is framed by lively and informative introductions, which introduce the work of these thinkers, and which also introduce the reader to the crucial importance of the issues that the interviews address. The result is an entertaining and hugely useful introduction to the key ideas in the field, the strengths and problematic weaknesses of cultural studies as a discipline, allowing the reader to chart its development, and to identify emerging trends. This book is ideal for students of cultural studies and the interdisciplinary arts and humanities, and will be of great interest to teachers and researchers working within a very wide range of areas of cultural studies.<br>

  Book Title: Forbidden Fictions-Pornography and Censorship in Twentieth-Century French Literature<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Phillips John<br>
  Abstract: ‘Phillips discusses texts by Apollinaire, Pierre Loüys, Georges Bataille, Pauline Réage, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Tony Duvert, Elizabeth Barillé and Marie Darrieussecq, engaging in different levels of critical analysis so as to emphasize intertextual and parodic elements in one case, or points of possible identification in another.’ TLS French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than its Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Forbidden Fictions is the first English-language study devoted exclusively to the wide spectrum of French literary pornography in the twentieth century. John Phillips provides a broad history of the genre and the associated moral and political issues. Among the texts examined in detail – all selected for their literary or sociopolitical importance – are landmark works by Apollinaire, Louÿs, Bataille, Réage, Robbe-Grillet, Arsan, and Duvert. Phillips challenges current politically correct trends in literary criticism and stereotyped censoring discourses about pornography to provide a new reading of each text and to illustrate the genre’s potential for social subversion. Forbidden Fictions addresses the most controversial issues of contemporary sexual politics, such as objectification, sadomasochism, homoeroticism and paedophilia, with particular emphasis on the feminist debate on pornography. In the light of current controversy over the control of pornography, this is a timely and scholarly review of the ethical, moral and social arguments surrounding the censorship of sexually explicit material.<br>

  1  The Erotic Novel and Censorship in Twentieth-Century France from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18fs6m6">Forbidden Fictions</a><br>
  Abstract: French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than Anglo-Saxon culture. This impression is partly due to the large numbers of pornographic publications which have been imported from Paris since the sixteenth century, first into England and later into the United States, but also to the peculiarly French association of pornography and subversion, hence the fascination that the genre has held for well-known and highly regarded writers from Rabelais to Robbe-Grillet. The choice of modern French (as opposed to any other nation’s) pornography as object of study is, therefore, justified by the unique existence<br>

  Abstract: Emmanuelle Arsan’s first novel,
                  Emmanuelle, was published secretly in 1959 by Eric Losfeld in Paris, at a time of renewed public interest in erotic writing. Recent court cases in France had led to the unbanning of works by Henry Miller, Boris Vian and the Marquis de Sade. At the same time, the 1950s had seen the illicit and usually anonymous publication of many new erotic novels. In particular, Pauline Réage’sHistoire d’O(1954), Vladimir Nabokov’sLolita(1955) and Jean de Berg’sL’Image(1956); all of these, in their different ways, had prepared the ‘cultured’ French reader for the more explicit<br>

  Author(s): Reader Keith<br>
  Abstract: 'This beautifully written and lucidly argued study is the most persuasive account of Bourdieu's work yet to be published. Lane illuminates much that can puzzle a foreign readership by expertly situating Bourdieu within a French context. At the same time he points to those aspects of Bourdieu's writing which are of particular relevance to contemporary debates on questions of citizenship and globalization. He gives a fascinating account of Bourdieu's astonishingly prescient analyses of the impact of the expansion of higher education, the influence of the mass media, the growth of the culture industries, and the changing nature of political and social elites, not just in France, but in the western world.'

  Abstract: Since its inception, the intercultural Bible reading project had a dual aim: to serve the academic community with insight in the way ordinary readers read the Bible and to achieve a practical result in such communities through their participation (see De Wit 2004). Behind this lies the acknowledgment that grassroots communities in particular read the Bible “for life” and that their readings have (transformative) consequences. The project seeks to open up the community of readers by linking groups that would otherwise have no knowledge of one another, in the hope that this interaction would serve transformation through reading the Bible<br>

The Indonesian Metanoia group from Maumere, Flores, consisting of prisoners, read the story of the rape of Tamar together with the German partner group BibelWeltWeit (Bible World Wide).

  Abstract: Intercultural Bible reading assumes that one is able to see through the eyes of the other. The core question of the project regards what happens when small groups of readers of biblical texts from sometimes radically different contexts read the same Bible story and get involved in a dialogue about its meaning. Differing contexts are present not only in different countries but even among groups within the same city. In the present account, people familiar with living on the street were paired with a group of highly educated young Christians. These two groups from the same city, but with contexts<br>

  Author(s) Snoek Hans<br>
  Abstract: In the past fifteen years a small miracle has happened: dozens of reading groups, thousands of miles apart, have read the same Bible text and corresponded with one another about it. This gives the impression that the Bible is a universal book that, despite differences in cultures and beliefs, can stimulate readers to look at a text differently. Although the success of the project of intercultural Bible reading has been surprising, it would be too simple to state that the exchanges have always led to transformation.

  Author(s): Parcell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: For over twenty years, the Chora series has received international acclaim for its excellence in interdisciplinary research on architecture. The seven volumes of Chora have challenged readers to consider alternatives to conventional aesthetic and technological concepts. The seventy-eight authors and eighty-seven scholarly essays in the series have investigated profound cultural roots of architecture and revealed rich possibilities for architecture and its related disciplines. Chora 7, the final volume in the series, includes fifteen essays on architectural topics from around the world (France, Greece, Iran, Italy, Korea, and the United States) and from diverse cultures (antiquity, Renaissance Italy, early modern France, and the past hundred years). Thematically, they bring original approaches to human experience, theatre, architectural creation, and historical origins. Readers will also gain insights into theoretical and practical work by architects and artists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Peter Brook, Douglas Darden, Filarete, Andy Goldsworthy, Anselm Kiefer, Frederick Kiesler, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, and Peter Zumthor. Contributors to Chora 7 include Anne Bordeleau (University of Waterloo), Diana Cheng (Montreal), Negin Djavaherian (Montreal), Paul Emmons (Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center of Virginia Tech), Paul Holmquist (McGill University), Ron Jelaco (McGill University), Yoonchun Jung (Kyoto University), Christos Kakalis (Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture), Lisa Landrum (University of Manitoba), Robert Nelson (Monash University), Marc J Neveu (Woodbury University), Alberto Pérez-Gómez (McGill University), Angeliki Sioli (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education), Nikolaos-Ion Terzoglou (National Technical University of Athens), and Stephen Wischer (North Dakota State University).<br>

Written between 1225 and 1275, theRose’s success among medieval readers was extraordinary: well over two hundred manuscripts are extant, dating from a period of nearly three hundred years. Its influence was pervasive in late-medieval works both in and outside France. By the close of the fourteenth century, it had been translated into Italian, into Dutch, and into English. It was one of the only medieval vernacular texts to be cited and glossed in learnèd monastic treatises. Furthermore, its influence<br>

  Abstract: In the three volumes of

Yet, the undeniable indeterminacy with respect to the object of our lover-protagonist’s passion underscores a certain emptiness that appears to characterize this object, at least at this juncture in Guillaume’s poem.

  Book Title: Quiet Powers of the Possible: Interviews in Contemporary French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Author(s) Winter Jay<br>
  Abstract: My subject is public history, history outside the academy, linking historians to the broad population interested – sometimes passionately interested – in historical inquiry. Public history is defined by this extension of the domain within which the scholar operates. The audience for historical literature defines the discipline as much as the professional credentials of the practitioner. Public history is thus an attempt to flee from the increasing specialisation and decreasing readership of professional academic work, both in journals and in monograph form. It is also a recognition that historical scholarship is intrinsically tied to concepts of educating the public, and<br>

  Author(s) Wallace James Buchanan<br>
  Abstract: Whatever may have been the intentions of the author of Luke-Acts when composing the story of the ascension into heaven of Jesus Christ, and whatever may have been the antecedents foremost in his mind, the quotations above from the church fathers Justin Martyr and Tertullian provide sufficient warrant for exploring Greco-Roman ascension traditions as essential contexts for understanding the ascension of Jesus Christ in Luke-Acts. The first generations of readers would immediately have detected a similarity between Jesus Christ’s ascension into heaven and the countless tales of ascension into heaven told in Greek and Roman traditions.³ While Justin will go<br>

  The Walter Scott Experience: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c99996">Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism</a><br>
  Author(s) Goode Mike<br>
  Abstract: In July 1869, Jefferson Davis, the former president of the Confederate States of America, traveled to Scotland on a tour of sites associated with Walter Scott and Scottish history. Davis’s ambitious itinerary took in Edinburgh, Abbotsford (Scott’s estate), Dryburgh Abbey (the site of Scott’s tomb), the Trossachs (including Rob Roy’s grave), Glasgow, Oban, the Isle of Mull, Fort William, and, finally, Inverness and Culloden. Davis had been an ardent reader of Scott since his boyhood, and much of the tour amounted to a pilgrimage to honor the most beloved author among the planter class in the antebellum American South.¹ But<br>

  Willing Suspension of Disbelief, Here, Now from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c99996">Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism</a><br>
  Author(s) Spivak Gayatri Chakravorty<br>
  Abstract: Two pieces of practical advice. Like Aristotle in the
                     Poetics, Coleridge is giving advice on how to sell poetry. And Marx cautions against basing all analysis on people’s sense of things; rather one should investigate what worldly factors produce that sense. One is talking about producing a certain willingness in the readership. The other is saying that willingness is produced by material conditions bigger than the personal will. For Coleridge, the determinant is spiritual. For Marx, social. Let us call this these remote presuppositions of my argument.<br>

  Author(s) Gelley Alexander<br>
  Abstract: In
                     Ariadne’s Thread: Story Lines,¹ J. Hillis Miller begins with a fable of reading, a fable in which the reader, although presumably following a (straight) line, is continually sidetracked, led off course, and thus forced into labyrinthine byways. How did the reader get into this trap? He thought he was reading a story, but he finds he is that story and can’t get out: “These blind alleys in the analysis of narrative may not by any means be avoided. They may only be veiled by some credulity making a standing place where there is an abyss” (23).<br>

  Book Title: Machiavellian Rhetoric-From the Counter-Reformation to Milton<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kahn Victoria<br>
  Abstract: Historians of political thought have argued that the real Machiavelli is the republican thinker and theorist of civic virtù.
         Machiavellian Rhetoricargues in contrast that Renaissance readers were right to see Machiavelli as a Machiavel, a figure of force and fraud, rhetorical cunning and deception. Taking the rhetorical Machiavel as a point of departure, Victoria Kahn argues that this figure is not simply the result of a naïve misreading of Machiavelli but is attuned to the rhetorical dimension of his political theory in a way that later thematic readings of Machiavelli are not. Her aim is to provide a revised history of Renaissance Machiavellism, particularly in England: one that sees the Machiavel and the republican as equally valid--and related--readings of Machiavelli's work.<br>

  Abstract: THE EARLY Italian reception of
                     The Princeand theDiscoursesshows that, from the outset, Machiavelli’s readers recognized and responded to his distinctive rhetorical flair. They were shocked (or pretended to be) by his brutal examples of practical politics; they resented his exposure of the inefficacy of the traditional virtues. They saw that the dramatic effect of Machiavelli’s work depended on his subversion of the conventions of humanist treatises on politics.¹ And some, like Guicciardini, recognized that, precisely because of this, Machiavelli was more of a humanist than he would have his reader believe.<br>

  Abstract: MACHIAVELLI scandalized his Renaissance reader not because he advised the prince to use force and fraud but because he refused to cloak his advice in the rhetoric of scholastic or Christian humanist idealism. Instead, he insisted that the prince acts in a world in which there are “no prefigured meanings, no implicit teleology,”¹ in which order and legibility are the products of human action rather than the a priori objects of human cognition. To recognize this, he argued, is to acknowledge the truth of power, as opposed to an idealistic notion of truth conceived in terms of representation, as correspondence<br>

  CODA: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c99bcq">Machiavellian Rhetoric</a><br>
  Abstract: THIS BOOK began as a study of the “other” tradition of Renaissance rhetoric—not the tradition of dialogue, debate, and consensus but of conflict, disunion, and dissent. Familiar with the argument that Machiavelli courted and then mocked the assumptions of humanist political discourse, I assumed Machiavelli was disturbing to Renaissance readers in part because of his attack on the humanist rhetoric of consensus. And I assumed that Renaissance readers of Machiavelli would accordingly identify him both with the subversive or critical potential of rhetoric and with political dissent. I was not sure whether I agreed with Pocock that “the truly<br>

  Book Title: Freud's Moses-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: In
      Freud's
            Mosesa distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

  Abstract: It is an honor to introduce this new edition of Geoffrey Hartman’s
                  Criticism in the Wilderness. The book is a key text for understanding the “fate of reading” in the Anglophone world over the past fifty years. Coincidentally, it is also a key text for understanding the trajectory of Geoffrey Hartman’s career as a critic and reader, from his first book,The Unmediated Vision(1954), to his most recent one,The Geoffrey Hartman Reader(2004), which won last year’s Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism.Criticism in the Wildernessappeared in 1980, the midpoint—give or take a few months<br>

  Abstract: In the matter of art we cannot draw up a Guide for the Perplexed. We can only urge that readers, inspired by herrneneutic traditions, take back some of their authority and become both creative and thoughtful, as in days of old. It is true, of course, that today they are less

  The Recognition Scene of Criticism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cc2mjv">Criticism in the Wilderness</a><br>
  Abstract: Wallace Martin’s response to “Literary Criticism and Its Discontents” is anything but naive. Its most sophisticated device is to posit my invention of a “naive reader” and to suggest that I would place the New Critics and their heirs in that category. But when I see the movement of criticism after Arnold as exhibiting an anti-self-consciousness principle or being so worried about a hypertrophy of the critical spirit that that spirit is acknowledged only by refusing it seminal or creative force, I am not alleging naivete but “organized innocence,” or the privileged assignment of some given, intuitive (in that sense<br>

  Criticism, Indeterminacy, Irony from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cc2mjv">Criticism in the Wilderness</a><br>
  Abstract: “Indeterminacy” is a word with bad vibes. It evokes a picture of the critic as Hamlet, “sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.” It is often said to involve an attack on the communicative or edifying function of literature. A pseudoscientific or anti-humanist bias is ascribed to critics when they do not replace words by meanings quickly enough. We like to consume our literature. We like to think of critics as service stations that keep readers fueled for their more important business, refreshing them and speeding them on.<br>

  Book Title: Atheism for Beginners-A Coursebook for Schools and Colleges<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘atheism’ is derived from the Greek: a meaning ‘not’ is conjoined with theos meaning ‘god’. So atheism may be defined as follows: it is the belief that there is no God. Unfortunately definition of terms is rarely this straightforward. In this educational book, Michael Palmer undertakes to analyse, develop and discuss the complex and too often reduced notion of atheism. In spite of the consciously atheist point of view adopted by the author, the volume remains critical and objective, making religious, philosophical and political concepts around atheism understandable. Even though the book clearly addresses a young audience, any kind of reader will find food for thought in this vivid and detailed work.<br>

  Book Title: In the Fellowship of His Suffering-A Theological Interpretation of Mental Illness — A Focus on "Schizophrenia"<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Swinton John<br>
  Abstract: Schizophrenia is often considered one of the most destructive forms of mental illness. Elahe Hessamfar’s personal experience with her daughter’s illness has led her to ask some pressing and significant questions about the cause and nature of schizophrenia and the Church’s role in its treatment. With a candid and revealing look at the history of mental illness, In the Fellowship of His Suffering describes schizophrenia as a variation of human expression. Hessamfar uses a deeply theological rather than pathological approach to interpret the schizophrenic experience and the effect it has on both the patients and their families. Effectively drawing on the Bible as a source of knowledge for understanding mental illness, she offers a reflective yet innovative view of whether the Church could or should intervene in such encounters and what such an intervention might look like. Hessamfar’s comprehensive work will provoke powerful responses from anyone interested in the prominent social issue of mental illness. Her portrayal of the raging debate between treating “insanity" either pastorally or medically will enthral readers, be they Christians, medical students or those in the field of psychiatry and social sciences.<br>

  Author(s): Robbins C. Michael<br>
  Abstract: This second edition of An introduction to the New Testament provides readers with pertinent material and a helpful framework that will guide them in their understanding of the New Testament texts. Many new and diverse cultural, historical, social-scientific, sociorhetorical, narrative, textual, and contextual studies have been examined since the publication of the first edition, which was in print for twenty years. The authors retain the original tripartite arrangement on 1) The world of the New Testament, 2) Interpreting the New Testament, and 3) Jesus and early Christianity. An appropriate book for anyone who seeks to better understand what is involved in the exegesis of New Testaments texts today.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4mm1">An Introduction to the New Testament</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter we looked at NT books composed in a basic narrative framework: the four Gospels and Acts. Although they include large amounts of direct discourse, such as sayings, speeches, and dialogues, the Gospels and Acts mostly contain narrative materials (e.g., miracle stories and historical legends). Also, the direct discourse in these books is joined by narrative comments and summary statements that permeate each work. The epistolary literature is primarily direct discourse. Its small amount of narrative material is mostly autobiographical. Much of its hymns, sayings, and teaching material is part of a dialogue between author and reader.<br>

  10  The Historical Jesus from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4mm1">An Introduction to the New Testament</a><br>
  Abstract: We began in the previous chapter with the task of recovering a chronology of the life of Jesus with its challenges of minimal external points of reference, multiple calendrical systems within which to insert data, multicultural varieties of fixing days or holy days or years within an annual calendar, and the like. Knowing as much as possible about Jesus and his world certainly makes the venture worthwhile, but the writers of the early “biographies” of Jesus seemed little concerned about certain time issues and quite unsuspecting of the obsessions that we as their eighteenththrough twenty-first-century readers would entertain.<br>

  Abstract: The Bible, the sermon, and the congregation are all intricately related to the personal. Each is influenced by what is seen and heard and by how events and words are interpreted. The biblical text has a rich historical context in the ancient Near East that aids the reader in understanding what the text meant. However, this history is not a static history, locked in the past. Instead, it is a dynamic history of the divine acts of God that can be seen throughout the canonizing process as successive generations interpreted the tradition and text for their situations.

  Abstract: Reading Scripture with the Saints is a small museum. On its pages hang portraits of Christianity’s “masters of the sacred page": Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine of Hippo, Benedict of Nursia, Maximus Confessor, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther and Charles Wesley. Other, surprising figures also appear, such as Shakespeare, Washington and Lincoln. How did these figures from history interpret Scripture? What might their diverse approaches teach today’s readers of the Old and New Testaments? What is missing in contemporary biblical interpretation that an awareness of the history of exegesis might complete? Join C. Clifton Black as he traverses the Bible, Church History, systematic theology, Elizabethan drama and American politics. Reading Scripture with the Saints retrieves pre-modern insights for a post-modern world.<br>

  Book Title: Grace for the Injured Self-The Healing Approach of Heinz Kohut<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Randall Robert L.<br>
  Abstract: Grace for the Injured Self shows the reader how the 'self psychology' developed by Heinz Kohut can be an influential theory for pastoral care. The late Kohut affirmed that religion is not only an expression of the self, but can also sustain the self in the alliance between faith and grace, with self psychology and empathy. Cooper and Randall articulately explore Kohut's psychoanalytic perspective of 'self psychology', orientated towards pastoral care for parishioners. The authors ascertain how the human condition is affected by 'self injury', and the relationship between this and the traditional notions of sin. Two interviews with Kohut, never before published in the UK, give the reader unique insights into the psychoanalyst who many regard as the most important figure in psychology since Sigmund Freud.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdwgd">Grace for the Injured Self</a><br>
  Abstract: In this final chapter, we will respond to the previous interviews between Randall and Kohut, as well as offer some additional reflections on Kohut’s value for understanding the psychological functions of religion. While the entire chapter represents our combined and united work, we will respond individually to these issues. We believe this will provide the reader with a broader and more comprehensive analysis of Kohut’s potential as a dialogue partner with religion. Thus, Randall’s reflections will be followed by Cooper’s.<br>

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

As one reads the poems, one should refer back to the contextual explanations for the sources listed below in order to grasp more fully how, when, and why the poems were published. In some instances this will be more obvious than others. It is hoped that these contextual elaborations will assist the reader in the understanding<br>

  Author(s): Howell Brian C.<br>
  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. In this new work, Howell shows that instances of divine action should not automatically be reduced simply to theological categories such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, etc., nor to criteria such as personhood, life, and approachability. Rather, he introduced readers to two unique approaches to “anthropomorphic expressions".<br>

  Book Title: The Joshua Delusion?-Rethinking Genocide in the Bible<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Moberly R.W.L.<br>
  Abstract: Many Christians wrestle with biblical passages in which God commands the slaughter of the Canaanites - men, women, and children. The issue of the morality of the biblical God is one of the major challenges for faith today. How can such texts be Holy Scripture? In this bold and innovative book, Douglas Earl grasps the bull by the horns and guides readers to new and unexpected ways of looking at the book of Joshua. Drawing on insights from the early church and from modern scholarship, Earl argues that we have mistakenly read Joshua as a straightforward historical account and have ended up with a genocidal God. In contrast, Earl offers a theological interpretation in which the mass killing of Canaanites is a deliberate use of myth to make important theological points that are still valid today. Christopher J. H. Wright then offers a thoughtful response to Earl's provocative views. The book closes with Earl's reply to Wright and readers are encouraged to continue the debate.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hebbard Aaron B.<br>
  Abstract: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics sets out to read the book of Daniel as a narrative textbook in the field of theological hermeneutics. Employing such disciplines as historical criticism, literary criticism, narrative theology, and hermeneutics, this work seeks to maintain an interdisciplinary outlook on the book of Daniel. Two inherently linked perspectives are utilized in this reading of Daniel. First is the perception that the character of Daniel is the paradigm of the good theological hermeneut; theology and hermeneutics are inseparable and converge in the character of Daniel. Readers must recognize in Daniel certain qualities, attitudes, abilities, and convictions well worth emulating. Essentially, readers must aspire to become a Daniel. Second is the standpoint that the book of Daniel on the whole should be read as a hermeneutics textbook. Readers are led through a series of theories and exercises meant to be instilled into their theological, intellectual, and practical lives. Attention to readers is a constant endeavor throughout this thesis. The concern is fundamentally upon contemporary readers and their communities, yet with sensible consideration given to the historical readerly community with which contemporary readers find continuity. Greater concentration is placed on what the book of Daniel means for contemporary readers than on what the book of Daniel meant in its historical setting. In the end, readers are left with difficult challenges, a sobering awareness of the volatility of the business of hermeneutics, and serious implications for readers to implement both theologically and hermeneutically.<br>

                     Bare presented to the reader primarily by the Narrator with one remarkable story co-narrated by Nebuchadnezzar. Essentially the reader in Daniel 2–6 is being given the theoretical side of hermeneutics, which we shall deem here as the “undergraduate courses” in this Danielic school of hermeneutics.<br>

  Abstract: We have in this reading attempted to find the significance for the pistic, sophic, and interpretive community as it engages in the reading of Daniel
                  B. Therefore we have taken the time and effort to display how the contemporary ideal/competent reader might interact with DanielBas text along the way. We reach a point now when our reading of the text is completed and we must make some necessary comments regarding the general implications left for the reader. Rather than a reiteration of the reader’s interaction with smaller episodes, we need to make some broader and more sweeping generalizations about the<br>

  Book Title: Translating the English Bible-From Relevance to Deconstruction<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

  Chapter Five  Still looking for clues from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf395">Translating the English Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: We saw in Chapter Two that in his exposition of a Relevance Theory of Translation, Gutt introduces the idea of ‘communicative clues’ and ‘direct translation’ at a crucial point in his argument.¹ A communicative clue is a feature of an utterance or a text which guides the hearer or reader to how the communicator intends it to achieve relevance. Gutt proposes eight kinds of communicative clue, and suggests that what he names direct translation ‘calls for the preservation of all communicative clues … [B]y preserving all the communicative clues of the original, such translation would it make it possible for<br>

  Abstract: We ended the last chapter with the potentially disruptive finding that
                  anyfeature of a text may be a communicative clue, and may indeed turn out to be the most important clue to how a given text achieves relevance for a particular reader. As we have seen repeatedly, there is a longstanding practice in biblical translation of attending to only some of the clues to relevance, and this arises because the translator’s mind is clouded by the idea of ‘equivalence’. Because she or he thinks that her task is to produce a target text which is somehow equivalent (however that<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Saul's Progeny in the Reign of David-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Longman Tremper<br>
  Abstract: Cephas Tushima provides a thorough analysis of the fate of Saul's heirs, focussing on whether their tragedies were due to continuing divine retribution, coincidence, or Davidic orchestration. He concludes that David was unjust and calculating in his dealings with the Saulides and, like other Near Eastern usurpers, perpetrated heinous injustices against the vanquished house of Saul. Traditionally readers saw Saul as evil and David as a hero; but more recently scholars have written about Saul as a tragic character and David as a villain, turning the book of Samuel into deeply contested interpretive territory. Tushima provides analysis of the critical literature surrounding this contentious issue and contributes his own study that will prove important to the continuing debate. He assesses David's character by analysing how he treats the surviving children of his predecessor, drawing upon the provisions for justice in the covenant community in the book of Deuteronomy. He demonstrates a connection between Samuel and the Torah through themes and motifs, and develops theological conclusions from them on such issues as the impact of human conduct on the environment, marriage, monarchy and Zion theology.<br>

  Book Title: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond-Essays in Old and New Testament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Lundbom Jack R.<br>
  Abstract: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond' places before a broad audience of students and general readers theological essays on both the Old and New Testaments. Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

When confronted, pierre claimed that, in fact, he did “not want to live except according to god;” the problem was that his wife did “not want to do what he command[ed] her.” He further asserted that anthoyne insulted him, demonstrating that she “want[ed] to be the master.” in a strong assertion of patriarchal sovereignty that modern readers find appalling, he insisted that he<br>

The chapter impresses upon readers a picture of unthinkable reversal: the impossible has occurred and everything is the opposite of what it ought to be. Gold has lost its lustre, sacred jewels are worthless, and precious gold is broken like clay pots (4: 1–2). כהעמי is cruel, suckling infants thirst, and those used to rich delicacies starve for lack of food (4: 3–5).

  Book Title: Beyond Old and New Perspectives on Paul-Reflections on the Work of Douglas Campbell<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Adams Edward<br>
  Abstract: In his work 'Deliverance of God' Douglas Campbell presents what Chris Tilling considers a "complete rereading of Paul’s letters that genuinely offers a way beyond problems associated with old and new perspectives. And his resultant picture of Paul’s theology generally, and the Apostle’s soteriology particularly, is beautiful, liberating, consistent, exegetically rigorous, theologically aware and pastorally compelling. It captures, I think, the best of the old perspective, with its concern to speak energetically about the God who saves, and it takes seriously the concerns of the new perspective on Second Temple Judaism. But in remarkable and jarringly elegant ways, it moves beyond them both." This collection of essays is divided into two sections. Part One analyses key aspects of Campbell’s account of the problem confronting readers of Paul. Part Two analyses key aspects of Campbell’s proposed solution to to the current confused state of Pauline interpretation. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in the study of Paul.<br>

God’s use of precisely this collection of texts for self-mediation to readers is what makes Scripture unique, and all rules for reading should be developed from this assumption.Vanhoozer’s understanding of God’s speaking action through a clear, determinate canonical sense of Scripture, and de Lubac’s understanding of God’s speaking action through a three-fold spiritual sense of Scripture both arise from the same desire to articulate God’s present speaking action<br>

  Abstract: Philosophical Apprenticeshipsgathers fresh and innovative essays written by the next generation of Canada's philosophers on the work of prominent Canadian philosophers currently researching topics in continental philosophy. The authors--doctoral students studying at Canadian universities--have studied with, worked with, or been deeply influenced by these philosophers. Their essays present, discuss, and develop the work of their mentors, addressing issues such as time, art, politics, hermeneutics, and phenomenology. The result is a volume that introduces the reader to the work of current Canadian philosophers and to that of their successors, who will soon be making their own contributions to Canadian continental philosophy.Includes articles by Gabriel Malenfant on Bettina Bergo, Saulius Geniusas on Gary Madison, John Marshall on Samuel Mallin, François Doyon on Claude Piché, Stephanie Zubcic on Jennifer Bates, Alexandra Morrison on Graeme Nicholson, Scott Marratto on John Russon, and Jill Gilbert on John Burbridge.<br>

  Book Title: Northrop Frye-New Directions from Old<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

                  Double Vision, the only book in which Northrop Frye explicitly discussed the question of religion and the church as distinguished from literature, he described God as “a spiritual Other” (dv20). Although Frye’s engagement with religious and spiritual questions was certainly evident to careful readers of his work from the beginning, with the ongoing posthumous publication of his diaries and notebooks from 1996 onward, the religious aspect of his work has become that much more obvious. The notebooks contain uninhibited speculations on the nature of God, and they reveal how Frye’s theological vision grounded and guided<br>

Schematism with its tables and geometric diagrams, either implied or manifest, never seems to have found a happy place in English studies.

  Abstract: When the novelist experiments with narrative techniques the reader, necessarily, becomes actively engaged in the process of discerning patterns and perceiving meanings. Within the context of reader response theory this paper explores the narrative layering in the novels of Timothy Findley and the structuring of texts that consciously anticipate the role of the reader. Implicit in this reading of Findley’s work is a tripartite model of reader response theory that includes a self-consciously constructing writer, a self-referentially deconstructing reader, and the enigmatic text of their mutual exchange. While the theory of the reader’s response has tended to be based on<br>

In other words, we are aware that what dominates this account from beginning to end is the powerful and creative mind of its author.<br>

Insofar as these primers orient elementary readers into knowledge of Christian faith, they set out the major points for theological discussion and debate. Eschatology often becomes the major landing point for discussions of salvation because the question of salvation is often framed in terms of ultimate ends. Under the doctrine of eschatology, soteriological discussions will circle around Jesus’s saying,<br>

  Book Title: Ethos and Narrative Interpretation-The Negotiation of Values in Fiction<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Herman David<br>
  Abstract: Ethos and Narrative Interpretationexamines the fruitfulness of the concept of ethos for the theory and analysis of literary narrative. The notion of ethos refers to the broadly persuasive effects of the image one may have of a speaker's psychology, world view, and emotional or ethical stance. How and why do readers attribute an ethos (of, for example, sincerity, reliability, authority, or irony) to literary characters, narrators, and even to authors? Are there particular conditions under which it is more appropriate for interpreters to attribute an ethos to authors, rather than to narrators? In the answer Liesbeth Korthals Altes proposes to such questions, ethos attributions are deeply implicated in the process of interpreting and evaluating narrative texts.<br>

  [PART 1. Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d9nm18">Ethos and Narrative Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: The question of how and why readers would attribute an ethos to literary characters, narrators, or authors is part of the more general issue of how people make meaning from and with texts. Within the humanities, such issues are traditionally the province of hermeneutics, which encompasses the theory, the method (or the “art”), and the practice of interpreting texts. Alternately, interpretations and their underlying processes are studied from the perspective of literary and aesthetic phenomenology, the sociology of literature, discourse analysis, the reception history of literary works (
                  Wirkungsgeschichte), or empirical research on actual readers’ responses. Current literary and narrative studies<br>

  Abstract: The controversy surrounding frey’s
                  A Million Little Pieces, sparked by his passing off as factually correct and honest a memoir that rather creatively invented its truth, raises some central questions. What might the consequences be of framing a work as fiction, or rather as (to some extent) factual, and of experiencing our reading of such a novel as a communication with a fictional character, or rather with a narrator, or even an author? In what respect would our ethos attribution change? What made readers expect Frey to be authentic and truthful in his narration of his character’s tribulations? Can and<br>

  Abstract: Should the debunkers of Frey’s “fraud” have done their narratological homework better? Would any of the current branches of narratology, each of which claims to analyze how we make meaning from narrative texts, have helped explain the bewilderment that for some readers, like Oprah, followed from Frey’s exposure? Perhaps, to the extent that narratologies offer heuristic procedures and concepts to tease out stances conveyed in narratives. Not really, or not yet, because narratology, though concentrating on textual features, insufficiently takes into account the conventions through which these features are invested with narrative functionality and meaning.<br>

  Author(s) MAHER SUSAN N.<br>
  Abstract: Acknowledged as one of the most important twentieth-century American nature writers, Loren Eiseley was a widely admired practitioner of creative nonfiction, a genre that, in part due to his example, has flourished in recent decades. Contemporary nature writers regularly cite Eiseley as an inspiration and model. General readers, as well, appreciate Eiseley’s eloquent, complex, and informative essays; devoted readers have helped keep Eiseley continuously in print since his books first began appearing more than a half century ago. Clearly, Eiseley is a writer who matters.<br>

  Author(s) NIZALOWSKI JOHN<br>
  Abstract: In his essay “Loren Eiseley’s
                     Immense Journey,” Andrew J. Angyal celebrates the revered nature writer’s unconventional public stance: “As Eiseley warns his readers repeatedly, he is not a spokesman for conventional science. Instead, he is a poet-shaman, a wizard-alchemist who adopts the disguise of a changeling” (70). The roots of this unorthodox self-definition are found in the depth psychology of Carl Jung. There are two central tenets of Jung’s philosophical system that range throughout Eiseley’s writing: the importance of the collective unconscious in shaping the structures of human intelligence and the essential dualism of human culture and experience.<br>

  Abstract: In this book, I have offered an unlikely image of the novel within the contemporary media ecology. We would expect that media would create a sense of connection to social and cultural forms by reaching out to describe larger media systems directly. Instead, what we have seen is that the contemporary media novel emphasizes quite the opposite: the limits of writing. Instead of isolating novelists, characters, and readers, those limits are precisely what allow them to be aware of the world beyond themselves. In emphasizing media limits, these writers are able to embrace an agency that comes from being an<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Comics Storytelling-  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): KUKKONEN KARIN<br>
  Abstract: Applying a cognitive approach to reading comics in all their narrative richness and intricacy,
      Contemporary Comics Storytellingopens an intriguing perspective on how these works engage the legacy of postmodernism-its subversion, self-reflexivity, and moral contingency. Its three case studies trace how contemporary comics tie into deep traditions of visual and verbal storytelling, how they reevaluate their own status as fiction, and how the fictional minds of their characters generate complex ethical thought experiments. At a time when the medium is taken more and more seriously as intricate and compelling literary art, this book lays the groundwork for an analysis of the ways in which comics challenge and engage readers' minds. It brings together comics studies with narratology and literary criticism and, in so doing, provides a new set of tools for evaluating the graphic novel as an emergent literary form.<br>

                  Steve Canyonseries (1947–88) presents readers with a formidable density of narrative information: from patterns of black and white on the page, readers can construct an entire story.

And how can we harness insights into the cognitive processes involved when reading comics for analyzing them?

  Abstract: In December 1800, Jacob, “a valuable Waterman” and “an honest inoffensive negro,” committed suicide by “stab[bing] himself.” Because he was considered valuable, his enslaver, William Wilson, submitted a petition to the Virginia governor’s office seeking compensation for the loss of Jacob, whom he referred to as his “chief support.”¹ It might seem unusual to contemporary readers that a slaveholder would file for compensation on the death of his bondman, but this was common in the late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century United States. Today we think of compensation for the enslaved as reparations, but rarely do we think about payments being made<br>

  Abstract: Though lying is not the same as storytelling, the two are not entirely unrelated. Both involve the construction and communication of counterfactual propositions and narratives. The difference between the two is in both the intent of the speaker and the understanding of the audience. Liars know the truth and attempt to conceal it, usually to advantage themselves at the expense of their auditors. On the other hand, both storytellers and story hearers (or story readers) usually understand that a fictional story is something other than literal truth—rather than working against each other, they collaborate in a mutually beneficial form<br>

  Book Title: Violence in Francophone African and Caribbean Women's Literature-  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): KALISA CHANTAL<br>
  Abstract: Chantal Kalisa examines the ways in which women writers lift taboos imposed on them by their society and culture and challenge readers with their unique perspectives on violence. Comparing women from different places and times, Kalisa treats types of violence such as colonial, familial, linguistic, and war-related, specifically linked to dictatorship and genocide. She examines Caribbean writers Michele Lacrosil, Simone Schwartz-Bart, Gisèle Pineau, and Edwidge Danticat, and Africans Ken Begul, Calixthe Beyala, Nadine Bar, and Monique Ilboudo. She also includes Sembène Ousmane and Frantz Fanon for their unique contributions to the questions of violence and gender. This study advances our understanding of the attempts of African and Caribbean women writers to resolve the tension between external forms of violence and internal forms resulting from skewed cultural, social, and political rules based on gender.<br>

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

  Abstract: Stendhal’s irony is more radical than Jane Austen’s. His characters tend to be unstable compounds, and they demand a shifting and flexible response from the reader. That response is enacted for us by the narrator, who regards his hero from constantly varying distances and directions. Stendhal’s rhetoric recalls, in its shifts and dodges, the example of Byron’s
                  Don Juan. That poem, like Stendhal’s novels, is a work of an age of reaction and political repression, of institutionalized banality. Behind both lie the French Revolution and the remarkable career of Napoleon. The vitality of the revolution and of the young Napoleon<br>

  Book Title: The Postmodern Bible-The Bible and Culture Collective<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wuellner Wilhelm<br>
  Abstract: The burgeoning use of modern literary theory and cultural criticism in recent biblical studies has led to stimulating-but often bewildering-new readings of the Bible. This book, argued from a perspective shaped by postmodernism, is at once an accessible guide to and an engagement with various methods, theories, and critical practices transforming biblical scholarship today.Written by a collective of cutting-edge scholars-with each page the work of multiple hands-
      The Postmodern Bibledeliberately breaks with the individualist model of authorship that has traditionally dominated scholarship in the humanities and is itself an illustration of the postmodern transformation of biblical studies for which it argues.The book introduces, illustrates, and critiques seven prominent strategies of reading. Several of these interpretive strategies-rhetorical criticism, structuralism and narratology, reader-response criticism, and feminist criticism-have been instrumental in the transformation of biblical studies up to now. Many-feminist and womanist criticism, ideological criticism, poststructuralism, and psychoanalytic criticism-hold promise for the continued transformation of these studies in the future. Focusing on readings from both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, this volume illuminates the current multidisciplinary debates emerging from postmodernism by exposing the still highly contested epistemological, political, and ethical positions in the field of biblical studies.<br>

  Abstract: Along with reader-response criticism, structuralist and narratological criticism has offered biblical interpreters a crucial entryway into literary theory and the reading of the Bible. The theoretical models and language associated with structuralism and narratology, however, are quite distinct. Readers unfamiliar with these approaches may find the technical terminology complex and confusing. For this reason we concentrate our discussion on five key terms:
                  structuralism, formalism, semiotics, narratology, andpoetics. Their interrelations will be dealt with along the way. Suffice it to say here, by way of explaining the chapter title, that formalism and semiotics will be taken up in relation to<br>

It presents a range of feminist and womanist readings-readings that demonstrate how texts construct readers by imposing ideologies of gender and power and how readers can resist those constructions through a critical engagement withfeminismandwomanism.<br>

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

These tales are “literary” because they result from a specific author’s poetics.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kmm1">Inca Garcilaso and Contemporary World-Making</a><br>
  Author(s) Martínez Francisco A. Ortega<br>
  Abstract: Garcilaso de la Vega’s
                  The Royal Commentaries(1609) has enjoyed an everwider appeal since the early seventeenth century.¹ Such rising popularity has taken place despite fundamental changes in readers’ criteria of evaluation and appreciation of this work. Up to the late nineteenth century, Garcilaso’s account had been taken as the most accomplished historical depiction of the Inca, but the discovery of new written and archeological sources and the emergence of modern historiography source criticism led historians and anthropologists to challenge its truthfulness. As a result, Garcilaso’shistorylost credibility. At the same time, thenarrativewas hailed as possessing the<br>

  CHAPTER 4  THE INCOMPLETE TEXT AND THE INDEBTED AUTHOR from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kmnj">Indebted</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, my reading of Agnon’s
                  A Simple Storyended with emphasis on the closing dialogue between Hirshl and Mina. While it is true that, in the narrator’s words, “Hirshl and Mina’s story is over,” the novel itself does not conclude with their dialogue. In fact, instead of granting the reader a sense of closure, the novel ends with the narrator’s statement that Bluma’s story isnotover. The narrator also promises the reader that “everything that happened to Bluma Nakht would fill another book.”¹ This promise, however, was never fulfilled. Subsequently, it only adds to the reader’s<br>

  3  Platonic and Christian Hope from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kn48">The Quest for Meaning</a><br>
  Abstract: Even a superficial reading of the Gospels will suffice to convince the reader that incarnation is the alpha and—as resurrection of the flesh—the omega of Christian faith. And with the body, involvement in the human world and its history is part of God’s self-revelation in his Word through the Spirit. The Christian community, whose faith is corporeal, communicative, communitarian, and sacramental, participates in this involvement. None of its activities is possible in the ether of incorporeal ghosts or spirits. All prophecies and fulfillments are facts of language; the entire liturgy is visible, tactile, and resounding; rituals have the<br>

  12  The Significance of Levinas for Christian Thought from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kn48">The Quest for Meaning</a><br>
  Abstract: It is a fact that gives one pause for consideration that in Holland, Belgium, France, Italy, South America, and the United States the work of Emmanuel Levinas has found its greatest readership among Christian philosophers and theologians. Although this work is supported by a long Jewish tradition—even in its strictly philosophical elements—it has impressed many Christians by its orientation, which, despite its great originality, seems familiar to them.¹<br>

  Author(s) Attridge Harold W.<br>
  Abstract: Crafting a literary work does not happen in isolation. Imitation and creative adaptation of extant models are regular parts of the creative process. Imitation and adaptation result in the formation of literary “genres” or types that conform to certain patterns, generating expectations on the part of readers.¹ Genres are thus inevitable wherever literature is created.² In some contexts, generic patterns may be more formally recognized and described by theorists, but genres are operating whether formally recognized or not.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69w8s">How John Works</a><br>
  Author(s) Estes Douglas<br>
  Abstract: Narratives need time to tell their stories. In fact, without time, a narrative is not a narrative. This is because in order to tell a story, the storyteller must relay to the hearer or reader at least one process or event. For example, “Everett” is not a narrative. “Everett walks” is not much of a narrative, though the present tense “walks” in English implies a motion that occurs in time. A better narrative would be, “Everett drove the car to the store, picked up groceries, and came home.” This is the beginning of a “real” narrative because it entails multiple<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69w8s">How John Works</a><br>
  Author(s) Luther Susanne<br>
  Abstract: Space in the Gospel of John denotes narrative space, which is all the topographical and topological information given in the text that serves to create the setting for the narrative action as well as a narrative world in the reader’s mind.¹ Narrative space can be created through reference to geographical spaces like “Jerusalem” or “Galilee”; through the naming of concrete spaces like “synagogue,” “praetorium,” or “Jacob’s well”; or through descriptive (“inside,” “outside”) or deictic (“here,” “there”) expressions. However, only fragments of the narrated world are provided through the words of the narrator and the characters of the story. The reader<br>

  Abstract: Point of view “signifies the way a story gets told.”¹ It elaborates the relationship between the storyteller and the story and the reception of the story by developing the way the author or narrator presents the reader with the characters, dialogue, actions, setting, and events of the story.² It is a multifaceted concept that biblical critics avoid—perhaps because it seems confusing or even irrelevant to the text’s meaning—yet nothing could be more important to the study of a biblical narrative text than the way the story gets told and the mode or modes by which the reader receives<br>

  Author(s) Skinner Christopher W.<br>
  Abstract: Understanding John’s characters and the ways the Fourth Gospel employs characterization is crucial to appreciating both its story and Christology.¹ Studies of Johannine characterization have proliferated in recent years, and the result is that much helpful light has been shed on a previously overlooked topic.² This chapter is devoted to helping the reader come to terms with the function and significance of Johannine characters other than Jesus. Since Jesus is the protagonist of the story, we are given access to a tremendous amount of information about his background and identity (1:1–18), and we are occasionally told what he thinks,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69w8s">How John Works</a><br>
  Author(s) Lee Dorothy A.<br>
  Abstract: Images in literary works are words that appeal to the senses to conjure up a corresponding picture in the mind of the reader. By definition, such images appeal to the reader’s imagination, which has the capacity both to visualize and to interpret. The Gospel of John uses a remarkable number of sensory images to tell its story and express its unique perspective on faith. Many of these images, through the course of the Johannine narrative, take on the character of religious symbols: vehicles of the divine world. Appealing to the imagination, image and symbol make it possible for the implied<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69w8s">How John Works</a><br>
  Author(s) Myers Alicia D.<br>
  Abstract: That the Gospel of John is rhetorical is not debated among recent narrative and literary-minded interpreters. Pointing to the gospel’s thesis statement at 20:30–31, these readers often argue that the gospel’s rhetorical goal is to affirm that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of God.¹ Beginning with the acknowledgement of the gospel’s rhetorical nature enables us to ask more questions about the types of rhetoric the gospel uses as well as their potential impact on the gospel audience. The present chapter will focus primarily on John’s relationship to classical rhetoric, meaning the tools of rhetoric used by speakers<br>

  Abstract: John’s Gospel is an inherently persuasive narrative text. Toward the end of the gospel story, the narrator famously explains his purpose in writing his account of Jesus’s life: “Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you [pl.] may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name” (John 20:30–31).¹ To assist its readers in believing, the gospel narrative employs a variety of literary and rhetorical techniques.

  Abstract: As even the casual reader knows, there is something different about John’s Gospel. No, there are lots of things about it that are different. Many of the literary traits that help make John’s Gospel what it is and which serve to differentiate it from other books and even from other gospels have been identified and explored in the present volume. Genre, style, time and space, imagery, characterization, protagonist, plot, point of view, use of Scripture, rhetoric, persuasion, closure, audience: each plays a part in shaping the story of the gospel, helping to reveal “how John works.”<br>

  Abstract: As he begins the work, Augustine presents his

But to know where we are as readers of Augustine—to know where we stand when encountering a mind across the distances of time and culture, and across the personal (although for the author of

It was never my desire to try to present the Trinity to my readers, to present Godas such. It is my hope, however, that this work might instead serve as an exercise in phenomenological theology, whereby the reception of the gift of love can be explored in the transformation it effects within us.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjkw6">Marxism and Form</a><br>
  Abstract: For Western readers the idea of Georg Lukács has often seemed more interesting than the reality. It is as though, in some world of Platonic forms and methodological archetypes, a place were waiting for the Marxist literary critic which (after Plekhanov) only Lukács has seriously tried to fill. Yet in the long run even his more sympathetic Western critics turn away from him in varying degrees of disillusionment: they came prepared to contemplate the abstract idea, but in practice they find themselves asked to sacrifice too much. They pay lip service to Lukács as a figure, but the texts themselves<br>

  Abstract: All of Modiano’s eighteen novels to date, except for one,¹ are narrated in the first person. It is always the same kind of first person: tall, dark, reserved and slightly bumbling, he is also always engaged in a search for something in the past, either his own or someone else’s. He is the likeable if rather underconfident guide who takes the reader through the plot and on this search, which also always ends in relative failure.²<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  Unreal Stories: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6dst">Patrick Modiano</a><br>
  Abstract: It is often assumed that Modiano is a ‘realist’. One reason for this is that his prose is representational, full of small and precise details in the manner of the Barthesian ‘effet de réel’. Many of these facts, moreover, have been discovered to be real; they are precise locations in Paris, or a particular brand of cigarette commonly smoked in France. Their authenticity has convinced some readers that the narrative which contains them must be a mimetic one. Another commonly held reason for considering Modiano a ‘realist’ is the combination of readability and alleged non-experimentation which characterises his novels; in<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Being Playful: from:

  Abstract: We have now seen numerous instances of Modiano at his most subversive. The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be playful subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

  Abstract: Narrators of very different kinds can elicit feelings of strangeness in the audience. Over the course of this book we will run into a number of “strange” narrators—where the scare quotes highlight, here and throughout, that a narrator cannot be strange in and of itself: strangeness is always a matter of experiential and interpretive negotiation between particular readers and particular texts. However, feelings of strangeness are not completely unpredictable either, because readers within a certain interpretive community—or within neighboring communities—tend to share a large number of cultural assumptions and templates for defining “normality” (for instance, in relation<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gr7dkd">Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: I stressed in the prologue that defamiliarization is far from being a purely cognitive process of belief change, since it is always accompanied by an emotional “feel,” which may span a wide affective gamut of curiosity, puzzlement, hesitation, and unease. This chapter focuses on the feelings of strangeness that underlie readers’ engagements with characters by using as case studies two novels, Haruki Murakami’s
                  Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World(2011; originally published in Japanese in 1985) and Martin Amis’sTime’s Arrow(2003; first edition 1991). Both texts play on a triangulation between the reader and two narrators (Murakami)<br>

However for other readers, familiar with the extravagant mission of the counter-culture and the shrivelling of revolutionary – or pseudo-revolutionary – politicking, the ‘spirit of the 60s’ may be thought of as beyond resuscitation.

To be sure, nothing can dispel the tale’s unsettling violence; nevertheless, it has become possible to appreciate how the narrative’s use of metaphor and gender allowed its ancient readers<br>

  Publisher: The Gingko Library<br>
  Author(s): Ormsby Eric<br>
  Abstract: In
      Rethinking Islam, Katajun Amirpur argues that the West's impression of Islam as a backward-looking faith, resistant to post-Enlightenment thinking, is misleading and-due to its effects on political discourse-damaging. Introducing readers to key thinkers and activists-such as Abu Zaid, a free-thinking Egyptian Qur'an scholar; Abdolkarim Soroush, an academic and former member of Khomeini's Cultural Revolution Committee; and Amina Wadud, an American feminist who was the first woman to lead the faithful in Friday Prayer-Amirpur reveals a powerful yet lesser-known tradition of inquiry and dissent within Islam, one that is committed to democracy and human rights. By examining these and many other similar figures' ideas, she reveals the many ways they reject fundamentalist assertions and instead call for a diversity of opinion, greater freedom, and equality of the sexes.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Abstract: “Irish” spaces in the United States are constructions of memory, tradition, and identity that can inhabit both physical and psychic realms. The New York–based

Irish cultural festivals around the country deploy identifiable markers of US Irishness (live Irish music, beer, Irish dancing, Irish gifts, genealogy kits) to draw crowds of Irish and other Americans. But Gaelic Park, on the northern edge of New York City, offers a physical, visceral opportunity inaccessible elsewhere. Gaelic Park is an<br>

  Author(s) GIBBONS LUKE<br>
  Abstract: In his early review of
                  A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Ezra Pound noted in passing that Joyce’s work acquired an additional currency for readers in the aftermath of the Easter Rising of 1916: “If more people had readA Portraitand certain stories in Mr Joyce’sDublinersthere might have been less recent trouble in Ireland. A clear diagnosis is never without value” (Pound 1970, 83). For Pound, it is as if Joyce is writing in the prose ofcounter-insurgency, diagnosing the ills that should have been redressed to prevent revolution, but for others his writing<br>

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible in the near future.

  Book Title: A Poetics of Unnatural Narrative-  Publisher: Ohio State University Press<br>
  Author(s): RICHARDSON BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: A Poetics of Unnatural Narrativeoffers a collection of foundational essays introducing the reader to the full scope of unnatural narrative theory: its meaning, its goals, its extent, its paradoxes. This volume brings together a distinguished group of international critics, scholars, and historians that includes several of the world's leading narrative theorists. Together, they survey many basic areas of narrative studies from an unnatural perspective: story, time, space, voice, minds, narrative levels, "realism," nonfiction, hyperfiction, and narrative poetry. Rarely have these fundamental concepts been subjected to such an original and thoroughgoing reconceptualization. Much of the book is directed toward an investigation of experimental and antirealist work. Each essay focuses on texts and episodes that narrative theory has tended to neglect, and each provides theoretical formulations that are commensurate with such exceptional, albeit neglected, works.A Poetics of Unnatural Narrativearticulates and delineates the newest and most radical movement in narrative studies. This anthology will be of great interest to students and scholars of narrative studies and of the history and theory of modern fiction.<br>

  Abstract: In the aftermath of Mayhew, representations of the urban poor become prominent features of journalistic discourse in the 1860s and 1870s.

  Abstract: That prosopopoeic synecdoche for spectral legions of amateur researchers of independent means, the “elderly gentleman of scientific attainments” with whom we concluded the previous chapter, is associated with light and with illumination, in several ways. The first association has to do with literal light. As we have seen, the empirical fact of its appearance is separated from the misinterpretation that arises from it. This separation leads to a moment of epistemological enlightenment, however dubious or risible this may appear to the reader through the focus offered by Boz. This in turn survives beyond the event to become a scientific “paper”<br>

  INTRODUCTION. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kk665x">Revelation and Convergence</a><br>
  Author(s) Bosco Mark<br>
  Abstract: Flannery O’Connor’s fiction stands as a singular achievement of twentieth-century American literature, yet scholars and enthusiasts of her novels and short stories have been inevitably drawn to her posthumously published critical essays,
                  Mystery and Manners(1969), and to her personal letters to friends and colleagues,The Habit of Being(1979). Reading these texts one gleans further insight into the extraordinary clarity of vision that inspired and focused O’Connor’s talent. InMystery and Mannersone appreciates the context of O’Connor’s southern Catholic experience, allowing the reader to connect the dots between her erudite statements about the craft of fiction with the<br>

  Abstract: In his 1925 book
                  Trois réformateurs(Three Reformers: Luther, Descartes, Rousseau), in the section devoted to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jacques Maritain denounced the modern fiction writer’s “shameless” claim to provide the reader with knowledge of the secret and innermost interiority of a human being’s “heart,” in the biblical sense of the term. Such knowledge of another’s heart, writes Maritain, is “hidden from the angels, and open only to the priestly knowledge [la science sacerdotale] of Christ.” Maritain continues: “A Freud to-day attempts to violate [these secrets] by psychological tricks.

  Abstract: We cannot answer the question of what makes mythology so attractive to writers and readers of modern literature if we remain with structure and semiotics alone and ignore myth’s talent for arguing for the numinous signifier and the validity of the supernatural. But, not surprisingly, that has been a much avoided question in modern literary criticism. The safest way of showing the relationship between the sacred and art, for example, has long been to emphasize art’s reference to or use of religious and mythological (meaning archetypal) motifs. Art becomes the transition between the numinous and the everyday. But as I<br>

  III  SEEING INTO MYSTERY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m323xn">Flannery O'Connor and the Language of Apocalypse</a><br>
  Abstract: O’Connor’s metaphors, particularly her characteristic
                  as if, release a power, often violent and threatening, that demands the death of the understanding before the reader can begin to evolve a new consciousness. The power exists in man and in external nature, but it remains hidden to those who seeasand notas if. Onnie Jay Holy, inWise Blood, could represent all those literalists who cling to the assurance of the understanding: “You don’t have to believe nothing you don’t understand and approve of. If you don’t understand it, it ain’t true, and that’s all there is to it. Nojokers<br>

  Abstract: It is not hardto account for the note of barely restrained impatience audible in Coleridge’s refutation of Wordsworth’s notions of poetic language and form. In the Preface toLyrical Balladsthe almost casual dismissal of meter and related aspects of prosodic structure affronted Coleridge’s dearest experiences as reader and poet as much as they clashed with his reasoned ideas about poetry. No aspect of the poet’s art interested him more than its technique. Virgil, whose versification he admired “beyond measure,” delighted him for that reason alone.

  Abstract: Of Wordsworth’s declarationsthat the language of good poetry is ideally derived from rustic speech, and that there is no essential difference between the languages of poetry and prose, Coleridge provided the readers of theBiographia Literariawith a bi-level refutation. On the first level, which has received the bulk of critical attention since, are several more or less direct denials of these assertions themselves or of assumptions they seem to entail. Thus he retorts that the best part of any language comes not from the countryman’s daily communion with nature but from the intellectual and imaginative activity of educated<br>

  Author(s) Clark David<br>
  Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena to appear in Irish literature since the late 1990s has been the rise of ‘homegrown’ crime fiction. Irish crime narrative has been strong, historically, as a sub-genre, but until the 1990s had largely been concerned with the representation of fictional crime in non-Irish settings, usually the US or the UK. Since the period immediately prior to the economic boom commonly known as the Celtic Tiger, however, a number of circumstances have given rise to a situation in which, for the first time, Irish readers are demanding novels and other narratives which portray Irish crime<br>

  Author(s) Ash Kate<br>
  Abstract: Canonised in 1250, Queen Margaret of Scotland is perhaps one of the most familiar Scottish saints to modern readers, yet surprisingly little material relating to her life (beyond brief mentions in chronicles) survives from the Middle Ages. Furthermore, there has been little scholarly consideration of the literariness of representations of Margaret. What work has been done focuses on Margaret as a historical figure, or uses material relating to her sanctity as evidence for the existence of particular sites of veneration within Scotland. These studies are useful for understanding Margaret’s role in Scotland in historical and religious terms, and suggest avenues<br>

  Book Title: Sin and Evil-Moral Values in Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PAULSON RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The confusion of sin and evil, or religious and moral transgression, is the subject of Ronald Paulson's latest book. He calls attention to the important distinction between sin and Evil (with a capital E) that in our times is largely ignored, and to the further confusion caused by the term "moral values." Ranging widely through the history of Western literature, Paulson focuses particularly on American and English works of the eighteenth through twentieth centuries to discover how questions of evil and sin-and evil and sinful behavior-have been discussed and represented.The breadth of Paulson's discussion is enormous, taking the reader from Greek and Roman tragedy, to Christian satire in the work of Swift and Hogarth, to Hawthorne's and Melville's novels, and finally to twentieth-century studies of good and evil by such authors as James, Conrad, Faulkner, Greene, Heller, Vonnegut, and O'Brien. Where does evil come from? What are "moral values"? If evil is a cultural construct, what does that imply? Paulson's literary tour of sin and evil over the past two hundred years provides not only a historical perspective but also new ways of thinking about important issues that characterize our own era of violence, intolerance, and war.<br>

  Book Title: Who Was Jacques Derrida?-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): MIKICS DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Who Was Jacques Derrida?is the first intellectual biography of Derrida, the first full-scale appraisal of his career, his influence, and his philosophical roots. It is also the first attempt to define his crucial importance as the ambassador of "theory," the phenomenon that has had a profound influence on academic life in the humanities. Mikics lucidly and sensitively describes for the general reader Derrida's deep connection to his Jewish roots. He succinctly defines his vision of philosophy as a discipline that resists psychology. While pointing out the flaws of that vision and Derrida's betrayal of his most adamantly expounded beliefs, Mikics ultimately concludes that "Derrida was neither so brilliantly right nor so badly wrong as his enthusiasts and critics, respectively, claimed."<br>

  Abstract: Walking has played a fundamental role in all animal species throughout evolution. When aquatic life gave way to terrestrial life, a whole set of problems had to be resolved, beginning with integrating the four elements of walking: posture, locomotor rhythm, gaze, and gesture. To the reader who might think that we are about to launch into a question of restricted and basic motor physiology, that is, far removed from cognitive function, I would say that posture is none other than “preparation to act,”¹ and locomotion is not only about making successive steps but also navigating in space.

They are units that constitute intellectual fashions, which in turn create predispositions toward the reception and digestion of their own and other books’ content. Books, especially famous books, possess auras that may enwrap them long before most of their readers open them. The social<br>

He was a pioneer in demonstrating that the linguistic signs of which a text is composed carry complex webs of associations to the contexts from which they emerged, thus communicating multiple and hidden significations to different listeners and readers. Freud was much more than a natural scientist—he always wished to be, and was, also a humanist.¹ In his “Autobiographical Study” Freud recalled that neither in his youth, “nor indeed in my later life, did I feel any particular predilection for the career of a doctor.

On the other hand, mega-novels also contain text that, though appearing to be cruft, turns out to be quite important. Letzler posits that this cruft requires readers to develop a sophisticated method of attentional modulation, allowing one to subtly distinguish between text requiring focused attention and text that must be skimmed or even skipped to avoid processing failures.
      The Cruft of Fictionshows how the attentional maturation prompted by reading mega-novels can help manage the information overload that increasingly characterizes contemporary life.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pc5fzd">The Cruft of Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: I mean a certain type of big book: the extremely literate, erudite tomes around which one must plan one’s life for a month; the books one hesitates to approach without the assistance of a university course, a reading circle, or at least a reader’s guide; the books whose spines stare down from bookshelves, holding dominion over entire rooms; the books that inspire fanatical devotion and revulsion in equal parts, even though both seem exaggerated well beyond even the books’ own elephantine materiality. I mean the books Frederick R. Karl calls “mega-novels,”<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pc5fzd">The Cruft of Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: Unique among the generic categories structuring this book, the term
                  dictionary novelhas not, to my knowledge, been generally used to describe mega-novels.¹ This, I believe, is an oversight, because at least one strain of mega-novel shares with the dictionary its most distinctive characteristic: the desire to expand the boundaries of language. Dictionaries, after all, especially those in English, have long been used to increase their users’ linguistic aptitudes. The original English dictionaries were bilingual translating references, and the first ones written entirely in English were designed mainly to enlarge readers’ vocabularies with “hard” words, a function that can still<br>

  4  The Menippean Satire from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pc5fzd">The Cruft of Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: Though the previous chapters have used mega-novels’ relationships to several nonfictional genres to examine how their detailed accumulation of the facts of real life can overload readers’ attention capacities and subsequently prompt them to modulate their methods of text processing, cruft is not limited to the small-scale cases of the incoherent word, the irrelevant datum, the passing moment of consciousness. The following three chapters will examine how mega-novels’ incorporation of elements from other literary genres produces more extensive but equally pointless cruft, inducing the same characteristic frustration and boredom to provoke a similar reorientation of attention. We will begin by<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

  Abstract: The Workgroup on Constructive Theology, founded in 1975 at Vanderbilt University, has served as an organizational center for the development of constructive theology and a place where its key methodological and thematic proposals have been nurtured and propagated. Most basically, the Workgroup is a collection of prominent theologians that, in various configurations, have gathered periodically over the last forty years and collaboratively published four textbooks and one historical theology reader. Throughout its history, the Workgroup on Constructive Theology has variously defined itself, though never in very stark terms. This is partly intentional as one defining feature of constructive theology is<br>

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  3  READING TO BELONG: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwtdjf">Textual Silence</a><br>
  Abstract: The presence and importance of unreadability in the sense of a direct relationship between the reader and the text becomes more intricate and convoluted in writings by second-generation Holocaust authors who often document their quest to discover or write a “readable” narrative of their parents’ wartime experiences.¹ In the absence of this text, second-generation writers bear a more complex relation to even the idea of text than do eyewitnesses or other first-generation writers. Whereas eyewitness authors record their memories or at least try to put fragmented memories together and then read them, authors who identify themselves as “second-generation” writers search<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwtdjf">Textual Silence</a><br>
  Abstract: Second-generation authors are also readers of inherited memory, recognizing the presence of the unreadable through aligning themselves with their audience.¹ Part of the drive behind second-generation authors wanting to document their relationship with their parents is to read and touch the material presence offered by a text that they have been largely deprived of through a range of destructive and traumatic means. By their own recounting, second-generation memoirists acknowledge the push and pull of two incongruous forces: a desire to read—to handle, to contain—the experience of their eyewitness parents and, at the same time, a desire to understand<br>

  5  AMERICAN FICTION AND THE ACT OF GENOCIDE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwtdjf">Textual Silence</a><br>
  Abstract: Paradoxically, the more time that separates the Holocaust from the present, and so the less available the Holocaust is in terms of eyewitness testimony, the more accessible it becomes to readers and writers of Holocaust fiction and the more it becomes historically normalized.¹ Whereas eyewitness authors overtly acknowledge the impossibility of reading their texts in the truest sense of the word—a consequence of reaching the limits of language and representation—contemporary authors, often in an effort to shorten the distance between themselves and the historical event at hand, create a version of the Holocaust that is increasingly available as<br>

  Abstract: Holocaust fiction written by authors who are themselves distanced from the authority of survivor testimony and its inheritance lead readers to question the very value and meaning of the term “Holocaust literature.”¹ In his defense of Holocaust fiction more generally, Lawrence Langer notes that its significance can be found in “its ability to evoke the atmosphere of monstrous fantasy that strikes any student of the Holocaust, and simultaneously to suggest the exact details of the experience in a way that forces the reader to fuse and reassess the importance of both. The result is exempted from the claims of literal<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q1xs0v">Divination and Human Nature</a><br>
  Abstract: In contrast to Plato, the surviving portion of Aristotle’s corpus is made up of his esoteric works—lectures, essays, and sometimes apparently just notes, meant for an audience already at the advanced stage. One salutary aspect is immediately apparent. Aristotle has little use for dramatic irony and deals with issues more directly and systematically than Plato does. On the other hand, the particular challenges for Aristotle’s readers are apparent as well. Whereas Plato could be said to present sometimes too many words, elaborating long and intricate lines of argument in which his investment remains indeterminate, Aristotle nearly always presents too<br>

  2  Magic Realism, Social Protest, and the Irrepressibility of Language from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q6073">Stories of the Middle Space</a><br>
  Author(s) URQUHART JANE<br>
  Abstract: If looking at
                  Midnight’s Childrenas historiographic metafiction brings into focus the complex relationship between history, textuality, and authorial location, looking atMidnight’s Childrenas magic realism produces a quasi-religious comic novel in which the nature of language itself is problematized in the service of readerly responsibility. The presence of nonrational, magical elements in an otherwise apparently realistic, rational world serves as a rejection of the overwhelmingly scientific, rational approach to life which has been characterized as the dominant Western post-Enlightenment view (Harrison,Rushdie55). Rushdie himself, interviewed in 1985, made very clear why he considered a turn away from<br>

  Abstract: The dentist as healer and friend: This notion is likely to evoke cynical disbelief among many readers. Surely this must be a jest or mistake. The title of this volume itself—
                  The Health Care Professional as Friend and Healer—is itself a bit implausible, but not beyond belief. The imaginative reader can probably picture an amicable, old-style family practitioner who knows inside-and-out the members of the families for whom he or she cares.

  1  The Compatibility of Art and Religion for Willa Cather: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1qv5psc">Cather Studies, Volume 11</a><br>
  Author(s) SHIVELY STEVEN B.<br>
  Abstract: The touchstone for this essay is Godfrey St. Peter’s statement to his students in
                  The Professor’s House(1925) that “Art and religion (they are the same thing, in the end, of course) have given man the only happiness he has ever had” (69). The Professor asserts that art and religion are compatible, that they are—or at least have the potential to be—equal and complementary forces for finding meaning in life. Many readers and critics believe this linking of religion and art expresses not only Godfrey St. Peter’s thinking but also that of Willa Cather, who said almost the<br>

  Abstract: Complaining of prototype hunters to her lifelong friend Carrie Miner Sherwood, Willa Cather muttered, “You can never get it through people’s heads that a story is made out of an emotion or an excitement, and is

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1qv5r30">Early Jewish Writings</a><br>
  Author(s) Grossman Maxine L.<br>
  Abstract: The religious world represented in the sectarian Dead Sea Scrolls is one that assumes distinctive roles for women and men, as well as very particular understandings of acceptable gender dynamics and sexual norms. a feminist critical reading of these texts “against the grain,” however, reveals some surprising possibilities for women’s presence, participation, and authority in the communities associated with these texts. Such a reading also reveals significant dynamics of contestation around these social roles. awareness of the apparent power dynamics in the sectarian scrolls suggests that readers must be cautious in making historical claims with regard to the textual evidence.<br>

  Book Title: Identity and Control-How Social Formations Emerge (Second Edition)<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): White Harrison C.<br>
  Abstract: In this completely revised edition of one of the foundational texts of network sociology, Harrison White refines and enlarges his groundbreaking theory of how social structure and culture emerge from the chaos and uncertainty of social life. Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro,
      Identity and Controlpresents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.<br>

  Book Title: Natal Signs-Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting<br>
  Publisher: Demeter Press<br>
  Author(s): BURTON NADYA<br>
  Abstract: Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production. The chapters in this collection pose questions, unsettle assumptions, and generate broad imaginative spaces for thinking about representation of pregnancy, birth, and parenting. They demonstrate the ways in which practices of consuming and using representations carry within them the productive forces of creation. Bringing together an eclectic and vibrant range of perspectives, this collection offers readers the possibility to rethink and reimagine the diverse meanings and practices of representations of these significant life events. Engaging theoretical reflection and creative image making, the contributors explore a broad range of cultural signs with a focus on challenging authoritative representations in a manner that seeks to reveal rather than conceal the insistently problematic and contestable nature of image culture. Natal Signs gathers an exciting set of critically engaged voices to reflect on some of life’s most meaningful moments in ways that affirm natality as the renewed promise of possibility.Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production.

Beginning with the site of the First Party Congress in Shanghai (yida huizhi一大会址) and ending with Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the eight photographs gave readers a virtual tour of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) history. Designed to celebrate the party’s July anniversary, the images were paired with eight poems in the format of a traditional tourist’s itinerary of eight vistas.

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

On one hand, the novel’s debt to late Ming fiction,Shuihu zhuan水滸傳 in particular, leads to an ending that appears to nullify all that has gone before. Accordingly, Wu Zetian’s 武則天 regime and its support of female learning seem to crumble at the end of the book. Yet, as inShuihu,this arrangement is unstable, leaving readers uncertain whether Li Ruzhen 李汝珍 (1763–1830) was or was not supportive of the<br>

  Book Title: Transmitters and Creators-Chinese Commentators and Commentaries on the Analects<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Makeham John<br>
  Abstract: The Analects (Lunyu) is one of the most influential texts in human history. As a putative record of Confucius’s (551–479 B.C.E.) teachings and a foundational text in scriptural Confucianism, this classic was instrumental in shaping intellectual traditions in China and East Asia until the early twentieth century. But no premodern reader read only the text of the Analects itself. Rather, the Analects was embedded in a web of interpretation that mediated its meaning. Modern interpreters of the Analects only rarely acknowledge this legacy of two thousand years of commentaries. How well do we understand prominent or key commentaries from this tradition? How often do we read such commentaries as we might read the text on which they comment? Many commentaries do more than simply comment on a text. Not only do they shape the reading of the text, but passages of text serve as pretexts for the commentator to develop and expound his own body of thought. This book attempts to redress our neglect of commentaries by analyzing four key works dating from the late second century to the mid-nineteenth century (a period substantially contemporaneous with the rise and decline of scriptural Confucianism): the commentaries of He Yan (ca. 190–249); Huang Kan (488–545); Zhu Xi (1130–1200); and Liu Baonan (1791–1855) and Liu Gongmian (1821–1880).<br>

In light of the complexities of the meaning of Kierkegaardian faith, this chapter demonstrates how

  Abstract: Raimon Panikkar presents many non-Catholic readers with a set of challenging theological and inter-religious options. What follows in this chapter intends to affirm, to interact with and, in places, to complement and even expand aspects of Panikkar’s thought.¹ Apart from occasional hints, critical comment is reserved for the next chapter. There are, of course, Protestants who are wholly sympathetic with, for example, the radical pluralism advocated by Panikkar. But, on the whole, even academic Protestants who are concerned about interreligious issues are likely either to be unacquainted with his writings or unappreciative of his thought—despite his very considerable reputation<br>

  Abstract: The New Testament is thoroughly familiar with the Domination System, and has specific terms for describing it. In this chapter we examine three terms whose real meaning has sadly been obscured for many readers of the Bible. They are the Greek words
                     kosmos(world),aiōn(age), andsarx(flesh). With these terms the biblical writers named the Domination System and thus stripped it, for those who understood, of its invisibility and legitimacy.<br>

  2.  The Discourses of Jesus as Rhetoric from:

  Abstract: The goal of this study is to hear the discourses of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark as first-century audiences would have heard them. Though attempting to read the Gospel in terms of its own cultural/literary milieu, we are, of course, nonetheless employing a contemporary reading model that we find compatible with our goals and with the text under consideration.¹ We assume a reading model similar to that generally proposed by the reader-response critics, especially by Wolfgang Iser in his seminal

  Book Title: Antropologia-  Publisher: John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Faculty of Philosophy<br>
  Author(s): JANECZEK Ks. Stanisław<br>
  Abstract: Antropologia [Anthropology] is a gateway to the series of volumes devoted to particular disciplines of philosophy, taking into account their relationship with the Christian worldview and recognizing the need to include the philosophical and ideological diversity of contemporary culture. Antropologia covers Thomist tradition, enriching its achievements with other perspectives, especially Karol Wojtyla's personalism. Increasing influence of "third culture thinking", where the humanities are carried out in the context of the natural sciences, justifies the need to take up the difficult task of demonstrating complex problems of philosophical and natural anthropology. Anthropological considerations force us to realize the multifaceted nature of classical discussions on the nature of man, including theirs scientific and ideological facets, and to demonstrate them in a well-balanced manner. In this context, it enables readers to gain guidance in the debate on the philosophy of mind, providing ways of understanding and assessing the problem of the human soul (concerning the mind-body problem).<br>

  Book Title: God's Creativity and Human Action-Christian and Muslim Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MARSHALL DAVID<br>
  Abstract: A record of the 2015 Building Bridges Seminar for leading Christian and Muslim scholars, this collection of essays explores the nature of divine and human agency through themes of creation's goal, humankind's dignity and task, and notions of sovereignty. Part I sets the context for the book with "Human Action within Divine Creation: A Muslim Perspective" by Mohsen Kadivar of Duke University and "On the Possibility of Holy Living: A Christian Perspective" by Lucy Gardner of Oxford University. The rest of the book includes paired essays-one from a Muslim perspective, one from a Christian perspective-that introduce scriptural material with commentary to aid readers in conducting dialogical study. In her conclusion, coeditor Lucinda Mosher digests the illuminating small-group conversations that lie at the heart of the Building Bridges initiative, conversations that convey a vivid sense of the lively, penetrating but respectful dialogue for which the project is known. This unique volume will be a valuable resource to scholars, students, and professors of Christianity and Islam.<br>

  Abstract: Providing contemporary literary studies with the most adequate and compelling theory of genre available, Ralph Cohen has made accessible to scholars everywhere a systematic historical procedure for generating reliable explanatory narratives of literary, artistic, and cultural change. Such an extraordinary claim may seem extravagant and he would never have made it himself. Yet he would urge readers to weigh its legitimacy, a challenge now made possible with the collection of these transformative essays, eight of which are published here for the first time.<br>

  Do Postmodern Genres Exist? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xtv6">Genre Theory and Historical Change</a><br>
  Abstract: Critics and theorists who write about postmodern texts often refer to “genres” as a term inappropriate for characterizing postmodernist writing. The process of suppression results from the claim that postmodern writing blurs genres, transgresses them, or unfixes boundaries that conceal domination or authority, and that “genre” is an anachronistic term and concept. When critics offer examples of postmodern novels, for example, they cite omniscient authors who are parodied or undermined. They point to selfconscious addresses to the reader in

  Author(s) Holmes Diana<br>
  Abstract: As earlier chapters have pointed out, ‘popular’ is a capacious and slippery word. On the one hand, popular novels are simply the novels read and appreciated by a very large number of readers, as opposed to those that are canonised by critics and by literary histories but actually read by a relatively small élite. On the other hand, the ‘popular’ novel conjures up – if somewhat vaguely – a particular kind of fiction, raising the question of the aesthetic and philosophical specificity of the popular: do ‘popular’ novels conform to particular models of narrative? Do they deploy specifically ‘popular’ strategies?<br>

  Abstract: In his recent book
                     Democracy Matters, Cornel West names James Baldwin as the “black American Socrates.” “A blues-inflected, jazz-saturated democrat,” Baldwin, in West’s words, exercises “a powerful and poignant selfexamination—always on the brink of despair, yet holding on to a tragicomic hope,” bespeaking “a rare intellectual integrity and personal anguish.” Like Socrates, Baldwin infects others with perplexity, forcing his readers to grapple with the difficulties of “trying to be a decent human being and thinking person in the face of the pervasive mendacity and hypocrisy of the American empire.”¹<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Nature-Hope at the Heart of Ecological Loss and Grief<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): LANDMAN KAREN<br>
  Abstract: We are facing unprecedented environmental challenges, including global climate change, large-scale industrial development, rapidly increasing species extinction, ocean acidification, and deforestation – challenges that require new vocabularies and new ways to express grief and sorrow over the disappearance, degradation, and loss of nature. Seeking to redress the silence around ecologically based anxiety in academic and public domains, and to extend the concepts of sadness, anger, and loss, Mourning Nature creates a lexicon for the recognition and expression of emotions related to environmental degradation. Exploring the ways in which grief is experienced in numerous contexts, this groundbreaking collection draws on classical, philosophical, artistic, and poetic elements to explain environmental melancholia. Understanding that it is not just how we mourn but what we mourn that defines us, the authors introduce new perspectives on conservation, sustainability, and our relationships with nature. An ecological elegy for a time of climatic and environmental upheaval, Mourning Nature challenges readers to turn devastating events into an opportunity for positive change. Contributors include Glenn Albrecht (Murdoch University, retired); Jessica Marion Barr (Trent University); Sebastian Braun (University of North Dakota); Ashlee Cunsolo (Labrador Institute of Memorial University); Amanda Di Battista (York University); Franklin Ginn (University of Edinburgh); Bernie Krause (soundscape ecologist, author, and independent scholar); Lisa Kretz (University of Evansville); Karen Landman (University of Guelph); Patrick Lane (Poet); Andrew Mark (independent scholar); Nancy Menning (Ithaca College); John Charles Ryan (University of New England); Catriona Sandilands (York University); and Helen Whale (independent scholar).We are facing unprecedented environmental challenges, including global climate change, large-scale industrial development, rapidly increasing species extinction, ocean acidification, and deforestation – challenges that require new vocabularies and new ways to express grief and sorrow over the disappearance, degradation, and loss of nature.

  Formalism and Historicity Reconciled in Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones from:

The novel’s justly-celebrated plot with its twists and turns and surprises seems to involve for readers a series of uncertainties about the ultimate fates of its characters. And yet Fielding’s plot is distinct from what we now think of as ‘plot’. For one thing, the narrative unfolds in a supremely leisurely and digressive<br>

  Author(s) Regan Stephen<br>
  Abstract: One of the familiar conventions of autobiography is its revelation of an individual life through a compelling first-person narrative voice. To work upon its readers most effectively, autobiography needs to present the life in question as both unique and typical; it must offer an appealing account of an existence that is special enough and significant enough to warrant attention, but it must also sustain that attention through an insistence on common human dilemmas and a shared sense of endeavour. At the same time as presenting a single life as unfolding and uncertain, shaped by that which can only be dimly<br>

  Abstract: We have listened to reflections on the drama of hope, to the Bible, to exegetes, and to a good number of philosophers and theologians, principally Thomas Aquinas, John Henry Newman, and Bernard Lonergan. So I assume my readers are ready for an actualization of Christian faith in accordance with the concerns, hesitancies, worries, and questions about affective fulfillment, the meaning of human life, and truth, which were described in the introduction and in chapter 1. With respect to Lonergan’s levels of intentionality, I situate affective fulfillment on the fourth level, meaning on the second, and truth on the third.<br>

  Abstract: Immanuel Kant’s commitment to the self-congruence of character, with its pervasive impact on his moral thought in particular, may surprise some readers. Much more surprising, however, is his belief that the cultivation of character also requires incongruence. Despite his well-known prohibition against lying and a related distaste for hypocrisy, Kant often recommends something strikingly similar to both. Specifically, he recommends both
                  dissimulation(concealing one’s thoughts and feelings) andsimulation(pretending to be something one is not). Just as surprising—and just as revealing of his ambivalence toward self-congruence—is the subject of this chapter’s latter half: Kant’s occasional recommendation of<br>

  Abstract: Like Immanuel Kant before him, Søren Kier kegaard exhibits modernity’s acute ambivalence toward self-congruence. Kierkegaard’s opposition to incongruence reveals itself in his career-long indictment of hypocrisy. Caught in the crosshairs of much of Kierkegaard’s work are the pretentious ambitions of Hegelian philosophy, whose practitioners claim to know more than they do,¹ and the insincere conformity of the Danish state church, whose members claim to believe more than they do.² Kierkegaard’s works (published and unpublished, pseudonymous and signed, philosophical and religious) exhort the reader to shun incongruence. Instead, they encourage the reader to be true to the actual, existing “single individual,”<br>

  4.  HIDDEN LIVES, IRONIC SELVES: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wvwdtb">Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticity</a><br>
  Abstract: Kierkegaard’s deep-seated ambivalence toward self-congruence and theatricality extends beyond his pseudonymous works, and into his signed religious discourses, written, as the title page to each indicates, by ”S. Kierkegaard.” What’s more, the career-long oscillation between pseudonymous and nonpseudonymous works (published in a more or less alternating pattern from 1843 to 1849) dramatizes the depths of that ambivalence. While pseudonymity—what Kierkegaard elsewhere calls ”polyonymity” (
                  SV7:545/CUP625)—cautions readers against the assumption of sincerity (i.e., that any particular claim is necessarily Kierkegaard’s own), nonpseudonymity renews questions about sincerity. One rightly wonders if a signed work represents Kierkegaard’s own sincerely held<br>

  Abstract: The book is organized into four areas of inquiry: "Language and Logic," "The Self and the Other," "Temporality and History," and "Finitude and Mortality." In each, Dastur guides the reader through a series of phenomenological questions that also serve to call phenomenology itself into question, testing its limits and pushing it in new directions. Taking a cue from Merleau-Ponty, Dastur sees phenomenology not as a doctrine, a catalogue of concepts and catchphrases authored by a single thinker, but rather as a movement in which several thinkers participate, each contributing to and inflecting the movement in unique ways.<br>

  Book Title: Spiritual Grammar-Genre and the Saintly Subject in Islam and Christianity<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Thatamanil John<br>
  Abstract: Spiritual Grammar identifies a genre of religious literature that until now has not been recognized as such. In this surprising and theoretically nuanced study, F. Dominic Longo reveals how grammatical structures of language addressed in two medieval texts published nearly four centuries apart, from distinct religious traditions, offer a metaphor for how the self is embedded in spiritual reality. Reading The Grammar of Hearts (Nahw al-qulūb) by the great Sufi shaykh and Islamic scholar 'Abd al-Karīm al-Qushayrī (d. 1074) and Moralized Grammar (Donatus moralizatus) by Christian theologian Jean Gerson (d. 1429), Longo reveals how both authors use the rules of language and syntax to advance their pastoral goals. Indeed, grammar provides the two masters with a fresh way of explaining spiritual reality to their pupils and to discipline the souls of their readers in the hopes that their writings would make others adept in the grammar of the heart.<br>

The two texts that are the focus of the present study are works that school readers in “the way.” Their authors, both master wayfarers, hoped to make “the way” easier and clearer for those who followed. My study of their texts has led to the discovery of “spiritual grammar,” a genre of religious literature that until now has not been recognized as such.<br>

  Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe’s failure as a poet appears to be a matter of consensus among his English and American readers, who find it difficult to account for his exalted status in France. Yet he is best placed in a transatlantic context, for his failure—and his success—directly stem from his American displacement. Poe not only inaugurates a species of estheticism that modulates into Symbolism, but sounds an abiding inflection of American poetic language, which is heard in the modernism of T. S.

  Abstract: There is a long, if somewhat sporadic, history of scholarship acknowledging both Whitman and Dickinson as humorists.¹ Still, these poets’ exaggerated or hyperbolic claims are often read seriously, making Whitman seem egotistical and Dickinson depressed or without self-esteem. In this essay, we argue that the figure of hyperbole is both intrinsically linked with humor and a key element in what makes both poets’ work at once colloquially familiar and radically disorienting. For Whitman and Dickinson the use of hyperbole extends other features of their work that defamiliarize and disorient readers’ values, perceptions, and cognitive processes, while simultaneously creating the effect<br>

  Book Title: The Spirit of God-Short Writings on the Holy Spirit<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Clifford Catherine E.<br>
  Abstract: Yves Congar was the most significant voice in Catholic pneumatology in the twentieth century. This new collection of short pieces makes his thought accessible to a broad range of readers - scholars, teachers, ecumenists and laity - and thus helps to ensure that an important theological voice, one that influenced many of the documents of the Second Vatican Council, continues to be heard.
      The Spirit of Godbrings together for the first time eight of Yves Congar's previously untranslated writings on the Holy Spirit composed after Vatican II (from 1969 to 1985). Two of these selections offer general overviews of Congar's pneumatology, a pneumatology based upon Scripture and the Tradition of the Church, but articulated in conversation with philosophers, ecumenical partners and non-believers. Other articles make clear the historical context of Vatican II's pneumatology and the Holy Spirit's crucial influence upon the unfolding of history and upon the moral life, the efficacy of the sacraments and, especially, upon ecclesial life.The writings inThe Spirit of Godhave been translated and edited by a team of scholars familiar with the work of the French Dominican theologian. An introduction situates each of the writings historically and highlights its theological significance. A bibliography lists Congar's publications on the Holy Spirit, the major articles and books written about his pneumatology, and the major scholarly resources to which Congar made reference in the notes that accompanied these writings. An index of biblical references and of personal names is also included.<br>

To the extent that it has been possible to do so, we have supplemented Congar’s notes by giving complete publication data and by noting, in square brackets, where passages to which he refers would be found in English translations. For those writings of St. Thomas Aquinas that are cited frequently enough to appear in our list of abbreviations, we<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 18, part 1 of
                  Anna Karenina, some seventy pages from the beginning of the novel, Tolstoy introduces Anna to the reader for the first time in person. The scene is a Moscow railroad station. Stepan Oblonsky is there to meet his sister Anna who is arriving from St. Petersburg; Vronsky, to meet his mother who is arriving on the same train. All four meet, exchange amenities, and prepare to leave the station; momentarily, a disturbing incident draws their attention: a railroad guard has been crushed by one of the cars.

  Uzhas in the Subtext: from:

  Abstract: “Andreyev says, ‘Boo!’ but I am not afraid,” Leo Tolstoy once remarked apropos of some of Leonid Andreyev’s tales of horror and death. Tolstoy had a very keen sense of the distinction between melodrama and drama. His
                  Death of Ivan Ilych(Smert’ Ivana Il’icha,1886) is a case in point. There are disturbing moments in this tale’s treatment of illness and death, but the elements of horror or terror (uzhas)² in the story do not belong to melodrama. Tolstoy’s purpose is not to say “Boo!” to the reader, that is, to frighten him to death, but rather to wake him<br>

  Abstract: Many of us know this famous passage from The Gift. Quite aside from its stylistic fireworks it has served as exhibit #1 in the ongoing debate about where Nabokov comes down on the issue of intelligent design (ID) and evolutionary theory. Depending on one’s epistemological point of departure, readers have tried now for some time to “get at” VN’s strategy for mixing and matching scientific and artistic observation. According to this strategy the artist must be able to observe and name the phenomenal world like the naturalist, the naturalist must be able to integrate different planes of reality like the<br>

  Abstract: For a prodigiously gifted
                  homo scribenssuch as Vladimir Nabokov, there is nothing more precious or distinctive about his constructed persona than his style. Indeed, the written trace is, to a degree potentially disturbing to some readers, that aspect of personhood Nabokov most valued. It was whatremained behind,always under his control, to be wielded with consummate elegance and grace even as the enemy, time itself, took from him his homeland, his loved ones, and eventually his own life. “Summersoomerki—the lovely Russian word for dusk.

  Abstract: One of the more fascinating aspects of Nabokov’s artistic method is the way he “covers his tracks” when referring to potential intertextual sources or “ influences.” He prefers his readers to believe that each work has emerged fully formed from the broad forehead (as opposed to dark loins) of his Zeuslike consciousness. Or so the prefaces to his novels, with their disclaimers as to matters of genealogy and their repeated references to the “Viennese delegation,” would have us think. It is not that Nabokov hesitates to engage in intertextual punning or name-dropping, which practice clearly enriches the links within his<br>

                  The Name of the Rose(1980), followed byFoucault’s Pendulum(1988) andThe Island of the Day Before(1995), has been accompanied by an increasing amount of attention given to the author’s writings on interpretation vis-à-vis his views on semiotics, textual analysis, narratology, postmodernism, and reader response theories. In North America, Eco’s role among contemporary theorists of literary criticism became noticeable after the publication ofA Theory of Semiotics(1975; 1976) andThe Role of the Reader(1979).

  Abstract: Only a very naive reader of

But the most important clue to Eco’s thinking while he composed this difficult work is infrequently cited by his critics. It is a theoretical introduction to a collection of Italian essays on esoteric interpretations of Dante from the nineteenth century–L’idea deforme: interpretazioni esoteriche di Dante(1989,The Distorted Idea: Esoteric Interpretations of Dante)–research carried out by Eco’s students in a seminar<br>

                  The Name of the Rosehad been chock full of more semiotic theories than most competent readers could ever hope to discern. Did this mean that the more helpfully namedFoucault’s Pendulumwould come complete with long discourses on sexuality, knowledge, and power? It was true that Eco had not often mentioned Michel Foucault by name in his theoretical work before this, but the tide was certainly directive, was it not? Then we began to read the novel.

Here I propose a semiotic model for understanding the dynamic of autobiographical writing during the course of per sis tent, brutal, and massive trauma, as experienced by victims of the Holocaust and other events of mass vio lence and harsh discrimination. The model I have used is based on concepts borrowed from the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, which may not be intuitive to some readers, but which I have sought to make accessible even to those who are not conversant with this discourse.<br>

These analyses also perform additional functions that, in order to orient the reader, require articulation here. Along with anchoring and instantiating the theory as developed in the first half of this volume, they expand and develop this theory further, exemplify its scope and range of application, and reveal the role of narrative considerations within a larger hermeneutic agenda. The following considerations, then, should be kept in mind when<br>

  Book Title: Novelas españolas ambientadas en Italia-Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar; Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez<br>
  Publisher: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca<br>
  Author(s): SANTOS M.ª ALMUDENA MATEOS<br>
  Abstract: Las fuentes en las que se fundamenta la novela histórica proporcionan, además de una ambientación correcta de la acción, la veracidad necesaria para que el lector reconozca el trabajo llevado a cabo por el autor. Este estudio se centra en descubrir las fuentes históricas, literarias, artísticas, religiosas y culturales de dos novelas muy diferentes que comparten un marco común, el Renacimiento Italiano. Mientras que en Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar (1877-1879) la exactitud histórica se presenta sólo en determinados capítulos que parecen ralentizar la acción, en Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), lo histórico está tan integrado que es difícil detectar qué parte se corresponde con la historia y cuál con la ficción. Las fuentes consultadas por los autores e incorporadas al texto narrativo proporcionan laexhaustividad necesaria para que el ambiente histórico recreado sea preciso. Al confrontar dichas fuentes con el texto literario se observa cómo, además, el marco creado ayuda a delimitarla psicología de los protagonistas, pues, aunque son personajes históricos, los autores crean una vida de ficción a partir de los hechos históricos. Por otro lado, las referencias literarias (correspondientes a un periodo que va desde los siglos XV y XVI hasta el presente de los autores) aportan el marco necesario para que los protagonistas sean portadores de una nueva inmortalidad. La exactitud de las descripciones, la configuración de los caracteres tanto renacentistas como contemporáneos, las perspectivas artísticas o religiosas, configuran estas dos obras en una serie de coincidencias difíciles de obviar.The sources, which the historical novel is based on, provide the correct setting of the action and the necessary truthfulness for the reader to recognise the work carried out by the author. This research focuses on discovering the historical, literary, artistic, religious and cultural sources of two very different novels that share common framework of the Italian Renaissance. In Fra Filippo Lippi by Emilio Catelar (1877-1879) the historical accuracy is presented only incertain chapters, and slow down the action, whereas in Bomarzo by Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), historical facts are integrated in such a way that it is difficult to detect which parts belong to fiction or non-fiction. The sources consulted by the authors and which are incorporated into the narrative text provide the necessary detail for the recreated historical environment to be accurate. Additionally, when comparing these historical sources with the literary text, it is obvious how the historical facts help to demonstrate the psychology of the main characters because, although they are historical characters, the authors create a living fiction based on historical events. The literary references, belonging to a period that covers the fifteenth and sixteenth century to the present of authors contribute the necessary details so that the main characters are bearers o fa new immortality. The accuracy of descriptions, the representation of both Renaissance and Contemporary characters and artistic and religious perspectives present us with a series of coincidences too obvious to ignore.<br>

  General Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2050vqm">Eve and Adam</a><br>
  Abstract: Observers of American popular culture may recognize Genesis 1-3 as a text hotly defended by scientific creationists who want the “biblical account of creation” to be taught alongside evolutionary theories in the public schools. Long before Genesis 1-3 sparked debates about the teaching of science, however, interpreters were turning to—and arguing about—other foundational issues raised by the text. For centuries, the biblical account of creation has prompted readers to propose very different notions about what it means to be a man or to be a woman.<br>

The biblical story of the first man and woman became for many readers a blueprint for relationships between all men and women.

No aspect of Genesis 1-3 escapes scrutiny and rabbinic comment; no gap in the story line goes unfilled. Modern readers of these compilations are likely to be overwhelmed by the plethora of opinions offered and the dissonance between authoritative rabbinic “voices.”<br>

That approach does not derogate from critical study, on which it relies, though a postcritical purpose inherently assumes that readers from later contexts can bring new questions to the text as well as submit to its otherness.

We do not wish to imply that the language of the poems of Hopkins and Eliot, in and of itself, makes our (or anyone else’s) readings happen.

  Book Title: Mirages and Mad Beliefs-Proust the Skeptic<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Prendergast Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Proust was long the object of a cult in which the main point of reading his great novel
      In Search of Lost Timewas to find, with its narrator, a redemptive epiphany in a pastry and a cup of lime-blossom tea. We now live in less confident times, in ways that place great strain on the assumptions and beliefs that made those earlier readings possible. This has led to a new manner of reading Proust, against the grain. InMirages and Mad Beliefs, Christopher Prendergast argues the case differently, with the grain, on the basis that Proust himself was prey to self-doubt and found numerous, if indirect, ways of letting us know. Prendergast traces in detail the locations and forms of a quietly nondogmatic yet insistently skeptical voice that questions the redemptive aesthetic the novel is so often taken to celebrate, bringing the reader to wonder whether that aesthetic is but another instance of the mirage or the mad belief that, in other guises, figures prominently inIn Search of Lost Time. In tracing the modalities of this self-pressuring voice, Prendergast ranges far and wide, across a multiplicity of ideas, themes, sources, and stylistic registers in Proust's literary thought and writing practice, attentive at every point to inflections of detail, in a sustained account of Proust the skeptic for the contemporary reader.<br>

  Author(s) Wootten Hal<br>
  Abstract: The material in this chapter arises out of some practical experiences of the way the Australian state has negotiated claims for the protection of Indigenous ′sacred′ places that were threatened by private or public claims to exploit or remake the landscape in pursuit of wealth or public safety or amenity. For many readers this topic will bring to mind the unhappy experience of the Hindmarsh Bridge affair, where such a conflict dragged out through inquiries and litigation over some seven years and left behind bitter recrimination about the genuineness of Indigenous claims, the appropriateness of processes for evaluating them, and<br>

  Abstract: Through all the twists and turns the
                  Arabian Nightshave undergone, the central theme remains, and remains known to every hearer and every reader: Shahrazad has been sentenced to die in the morning by the Sultan Shahriyar who, in revenge for the infidelity of his Sultana (he found her and all her handmaidens cavorting with slaves), has decided to marry a virgin every night and cut off her head in the morning.

In its primary and traditional sense,interpretationmeans textual interpretation, that is, the encounter between a reader and a text. In this encounter, something has to happen, some work has to be done: the reader needs to discover the meaning of the text, which is usually far from self-evident. The difficulty of the work is increased in the case of temporal or spatial distance: when the reader wishes to understand a text from another age or in a different language.

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jcrpr">The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film</a><br>
  Author(s) Palmer R. Barton<br>
  Abstract: A defining feature of science fiction is that such works of imaginative realism (a potent stylistic brew of perhaps irreconcilable elements) speculate about some future age or alternative, extraterrestrial world. That imagined place and time is characterized essentially by “advancements” in science that plausibly explore the consequences of what is now known and actively researched (in such areas as artificial intelligence, genetic manipulation, space travel, pharmacology, and so forth). The difference between the reader’s implied present and the postulated alternative results from the technological manipulation of the natural environment and human experience that such acquired knowledge makes possible.<br>

  Abstract: These twelve essays have several things in common. For one, they are eminently original. The authors have plumbed their inimitable subjectivities in ways that make them accessible to the reader. This volume is a case of the multiplication of the loaves or, to mix metaphors, an instance of what can be produced when a haunting is moved by a hunting that can locate its catch with words. I read these authors through a theological lens and do so unapologetically.

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Did Freud present a scientific hypothesis about the unconscious, as he always maintained and as many of his disciples keep repeating? This question has long prompted debates concerning the legitimacy and usefulness of psychoanalysis, and it is of utmost importance to Lacanian analysts, whose main project has been to stress Freud's scientific grounding. Here Jacques Bouveresse, a noted authority on Ludwig Wittgenstein, contributes to the debate by turning to this Austrian-born philosopher and contemporary of Freud for a candid assessment of the early issues surrounding psychoanalysis. Wittgenstein, who himself had delivered a devastating critique of traditional philosophy, sympathetically pondered Freud's claim to have produced a scientific theory in proposing a new model of the human psyche. What Wittgenstein recognized--and what Bouveresse so eloquently stresses for today's reader--is that psychoanalysis does not aim to produce a change limited to the intellect but rather seeks to provoke an authentic change of human attitudes. The beauty behind the theory of the unconscious for Wittgenstein is that it breaks away from scientific, causal explanations to offer new forms of thinking and speaking, or rather, a new mythology.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tvc5d">Faulkner</a><br>
  Abstract: The pronouncement of the nineteenth century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche as transmitted through the deconstructive spirit of Jacques Derrida and the casual remark of the contemporary American poet Tom Whalen on a writer’s pleasure in role-playing mark the wide range of this book’s theme. It contains cognitive, ethical, and aesthetic aspects, centering on masks and metaphors and comprising the sociopsychic implications for Faulkner’s readers of his personae and his imagery. Nietzsche’s replacement of truth by metaphor accords well with his conviction that the modern artist can best be understood as a wearer of masks (“around every complex spirit a mask continually<br>

  Abstract: In chapters 3 and 4, images of the artist have confirmed the profound affinity between masks and metaphors suggested by the introductory chapters on role-playing in photographs, letters, and interviews and also posited by the theoretical chapter. The analogy between the role-playing artist and the reader, who participates in the metaphorizing process, lies in the fact that both engage in an act of the imagination whose object is nothing less than to negotiate the tension between identity and difference.<br>

  Abstract: One of the most bewildering perspectives thrown open by the new

While this new approach leads to a better understanding of Faulkner’s fusion of regionalism and modernism, readers still have to be as flexible in their reactions to the widely varying metaphoric forms as the role-playing author. In addition to identifying with the artist as “countryman” and sharing with him the metaphoric implications of eyes “the color of a new axe blade” (756) and of a “sagging broken-backed cabin” (746), one should be able to catch the<br>

  Author(s) Lamb Matthew L.<br>
  Abstract: In commenting on John 3:24 “For he gives the Spirit without measure,” Aquinas makes the startling affirmation that the grace of Christ is not only more than sufficient to save the entire world, but that it is more than sufficient to save “even many worlds, if they were to exist” (
                  Ioan. 3, lect. 6, n. 544). To understand the concrete universality of Jesus Christ, the reader must overcome an all too contemporary tendency, rooted in nominalism, to oppose the universal and the particular, the metaphysical and the historical, as if one was only “conceptual” and the other “concrete.” In trinitarian<br>

  Book Title: Genuine Multiculturalism-The Tragedy and Comedy of Diversity<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): FOSTER CECIL<br>
  Abstract: While many modern societies are noted for their diversity, the resulting challenge is to determine how citizens from different backgrounds and cultures can see themselves and each other as equals, and be treated equally. In Genuine Multiculturalism, Cecil Foster shows that a society's failure to bridge these differences is the tragedy of modern living and that pretending it is possible to mechanically develop fraternity and solidarity among diverse groups is akin to seeking out comedy. Arguing that genuine multiculturalism is the search for social justice by individuals who have been trapped by ascribed identities or newcomers who have been shut out of perceived ethnic homelands, Foster details how this process, in essence, is the story of the Americas. Reconceptionalizing the terms of multiculturalism, he offers an intervention into Canada's claim that its definition and practice are based on recognizing equality of citizenship. Identifying genuine multiculturalism as an ongoing work in progress, rather than a tightly defined policy position, Foster challenges readers to imagine a greater and more harmonious ideal. A necessary theoretical reconsideration of diversity within society, Genuine Multiculturalism refocuses the debate about ideals and practices in modern societies.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b7h7">Truth Matters</a><br>
  Author(s) VAN RYS JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Of all literary genres, historical fiction is perhaps the most problematic and the most promising in relation to difficult questions of truth. Ostensibly rooted in some form of historical veracity in the traces of actual events or people, its fictional dimensions (from invented narrative to poetic qualities) nevertheless impress upon readers an imaginative truthfulness. In this way, historical fiction becomes a site of contention over truth; in its modern and postmodern manifestations, the genre becomes an exploration of the nature of truth itself.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric and Hermeneutics in Our Time-A Reader<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hyde Michael J.<br>
  Abstract: This thought-provoking book initiates a dialogue among scholars in rhetoric and hermeneutics in many areas of the humanities. Twenty leading thinkers explore the ways these two powerful disciplines inform each other and influence a wide variety of intellectual fields. Walter Jost and Michael J. Hyde organize pivotal topics in rhetoric and hermeneutics with originality and coherence, dividing their book into four sections: Locating the Disciplines; Inventions and Applications; Arguments and Narratives; and Civic Discourse and Critical Theory.Contributors to this volume include Hans-Georg Gadamer (one of whose pieces is here translated into English for the first time), Paul Ricoeur, Gerald L. Bruns, Charles Altieri, Richard E. Palmer, Calvin O. Schrag,.Victoria Kahn, Eugene Garver, Michael Leff, Nancy S. Streuver, Wendy Olmsted, David Tracy, Donald G. Marshall, Allen Scult, Rita Copeland, William Rehg, and Steven Mailloux.For readers across the humanities, the book demonstrates the usefulness of rhetorical and hermeneutic approaches in literary, philosophical, legal, religious, and political thinking. With its stimulating new perspectives on the revival and interrelation of both rhetoric and hermeneutics, this collection is sure to serve as a benchmark for years to come.<br>

On the other hand we seek to set forth general lines of inquiry and argument that are explored in the chapters that follow and that we hope will stimulate readers of this book to further questions and inquiries of their own.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bdtt">Rhetoric and Hermeneutics in Our Time</a><br>
  Author(s) Leff Michael<br>
  Abstract: “Hermeneutical rhetoric” is the counterpart of Steven Mailloux’s “rhetorical hermeneutics.” In an article bearing that title and more extensively in his book
                  Rhetorical Power, Mailloux offers an “anti-theory theory” of interpretation that situates literary hermeneutics within the context of rhetorical exchange.¹ Traditional literary theory, Mailloux argues, relies upon a general conception of interpretation as the basis for justifying particular interpretative acts. Such “theory” takes two forms—“textual realism,” where meaning is found in the text, and “readerly idealism,” where meaning is made through intersubjective agreements among a community of interpreters. As theories, these positions are diametrically opposed, but, Mailloux maintains<br>

  Abstract: For Milton’s seventeenth-century readers this passage, introducing one of the more prominent of the fallen angels, would have been immediately recognizable as a brief but trenchant essay on the art and character of the rhetorician. Indeed in these few lines Milton has managed to gather and restate with great rhetorical force (a paradox of which more later) all of the traditional arguments against rhetoric. Even Belial’s gesture of rising is to the (negative) point: he catches the eye even before he begins to speak, just as Satan will in Book IX when he too raises himself and moves so that<br>

However, the termuniversalitypresents a challenge, as it were—one that indicates not so much a philosophical position as a philosophical task.

There are at least five possible views that these hermeneutic thinkers may be holding.² I organize these five views around the hermeneuts’ position on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations.

  Abstract: The semiotic study of a literary text is not wholly unlike traditional interpretation or rhetorical analysis, nor is it meant to replace these other modes of response to literary works. But the semiotic critic situates the text somewhat differently, privileges different dimensions of the text, and uses a critical methodology adpated to the semiotic enterprise. Most interpretive methods privilege the “meaning” of the text. Hermeneutic critics seek authorial or intentional meaning; the New Critics seek the ambiguities of “textual” meaning; the “reader response” critics allow readers to make meaning. With respect to meaning the semiotic critic is situated differently. Such<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bzwz">The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes</a><br>
  Abstract: A proper literary reading of Qohelet must first deal with the problem of how to translate the word הֶבֶל (
                  hebel) in Qohelet and how this relates to the carpe diem ethic in the book. The frame narrator has supplied the reader with the leitmotif of the book: הֲבֵל הֲבָלִים הַבּׁל הָבֶל (“Vanity of vanities; everything is vanity”) (1:2; 12:8). In addition, הֶבֶל is used thirty-eight times in Qohelet, out of seventy-three in the entire Hebrew Bible, which reinforces this. אֶלׁהִים is used forty times in Qohelet, indicating that the relationship between the two is probably significant.

  Abstract: Several recent studies focus on translations in order to deconstruct notions of the other and, thereby, to reveal the foreign originary light filtered through the domesticating (here read colonizing, racist, sexist, etc.) lenses of a translating self. Such studies that rigorously locate translations in the moments and places of their translation (rather than in some translatable essence) may expose some general presumptions of lay readers who overlook the translated-ness of a translation. In doing so, however, they obviate the possibility of not only translation, but also reading. That is to say, in finding difference, in explicating the ways in which<br>

  Author(s): Desjarlais Robert<br>
  Abstract: Desjarlais shows us not anonymous faces of the homeless but real people.While it is estimated that 25 percent or more of America's homeless are mentally ill, their lives are largely unknown to us. What must life be like for those who, in addition to living on the street, hear voices, suffer paranoid delusions, or have trouble thinking clearly or talking to others.
      Shelter Bluesis an innovative portrait of people residing in Boston's Station Street Shelter. It examines the everyday lives of more than 40 homeless men and women, both white and African-American, ranging in age from early 20s to mid-60s. Based on a sixteen-month study, it draws readers into the personal worlds of these individuals and, by addressing the intimacies of homelessness, illness, and abjection, picks up where most scholarship and journalism stops.Robert Desjarlais works against the grain of media representations of homelessness by showing us not anonymous stereotypes but individuals. He draws on conversations as well as observations, talking with and listening to shelter residents to understand how they relate to their environment, to one another, and to those entrusted with their care. His book considers their lives in terms of a complex range of forces and helps us comprehend the linkages between culture, illness, personhood, and political agency on the margins of contemporary American society.Shelter Bluesis unlike anything else ever written about homelessness. It challenges social scientists and mental health professionals to rethink their approaches to human subjectivity and helps us all to better understand one of the most pressing problems of our time.<br>

  Book Title: Beyond the Red Notebook-Essays on Paul Auster<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Barone Dennis<br>
  Abstract: The novels of Paul Auster-finely wrought, self-reflexive, filled with doublings, coincidences, and mysteries-have captured the imagination of readers and the admiration of many critics of contemporary literature. In
      Beyond the Red Notebook, the first book devoted to the works of Auster, Dennis Barone has assembled an international group of scholars who present twelve essays that provide a rich and insightful examination of Auster's writings. The authors explore connections between Auster's poetry and fiction, the philosophical underpinnings of his writing, its relation to detective fiction, and its unique embodiment of the postmodern sublime. Their essays provide the fullest analysis available of Auster's themes of solitude, chance, and paternity found in works such asThe Invention of Solitude,City of Glass,Ghosts,The Locked Room,In the Country of Last Things,Moon Palace,The Music of Chance, andLeviathan. This volume includes contributions from Pascal Bruckner, Marc Chenetier, Norman Finkelstein, Derek Rubin, Madeleine Sorapure, Stephen Bernstein, Tim Woods, Steven Weisenburger, Arthur Saltzman, Eric Wirth, and Motoyuki Shibata. The extensive bibliography, prepared by William Drenttel, will greatly benefit both scholars and general readers.<br>

  Author(s) Finkelstein Norman<br>
  Abstract: Paul Auster the novelist came into print later than Paul Auster the poet, essayist, and translator, and presently eclipses all of his other personae, at least in the eyes of a general literary audience. 
                  The New York Trilogy has tantalized readers for some time now; more recent novels have also been well received. But while Auster notes that the poet and the writer of prose grew up together (personal correspondence, 15 October 1988), perhaps like the protagonist and Fanshawe, his alter ego in The Locked Room, the last book of the Trilogy, we can say with equal confidence that Auster<br>

  The Detective and the Author: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhp21">Beyond the Red Notebook</a><br>
  Author(s) Sorapure Madeleine<br>
  Abstract: Readers of detective fiction typically admire the interpretive skill of the detective, who, in the midst of mysterious, misleading, and disparate clues, is able to discern logical and necessary connections leading invariably to the solution of the mystery. Part of the strong appeal of detective fiction, critics have suggested, is that readers can identify with the detective and achieve interpretive victory alongside him, or closely on his heels. Glenn W. Most, for example, comments that the detective serves as “the figure for the reader within the text, the one character whose activities most closely parallel the reader’s own” (348). In<br>

  Auster’s Sublime Closure: from:

  Author(s) Bernstein Stephen<br>
  Abstract: In 
                  The Locked Room, as in the other novels of Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy, the path the reader follows diverges considerably from what might be expected in conventional detective fiction. This is due to what are, by this stage in the trilogy, predictable recourses to narratorial unreliability, epistemological uncertainty, and existential contingency. As these strategies come into play in the trilogy’s final volume, the trail leads neither toward nor away from a corpse, but instead into postmodern meditations on subjectivity, sexuality, sublimity, and silence. By engaging with the text’s thematization of these concepts, we can begin to understand both<br>

  Abstract: The moment has arrived to put into practice the idea that a translation of an oral narrative should be presented as a performable script. But if I were to follow the normal practice of anthropologists, linguists, and folklorists, I would now send you, dear reader, to an appendix or else to a separate volume—a memoir, a monograph, or the annual report of some institution. That kind of separation may be appropriate when stories are treated as raw products, as ores to be mined for motifs, archetypes, social charters, or mythemes, rather than as events that might be reexperienced through<br>

  Book Title: Dreams of Fiery Stars-The Transformations of Native American Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Rainwater Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Selected by
      Choicemagazine as an Outstanding Academic Book for 1999 Since the 1968 publication of N. Scott Momaday'sHouse Made of Dawn, a new generation of Native American storytellers has chosen writing over oral traditions. While their works have found an audience by observing many of the conventions of the mainstream novel, Native American written narrative has emerged as something distinct from the postmodern novel with which it is often compared. InDreams of Fiery Stars, Catherine Rainwater examines the novels of writers such as Momaday, Linda Hogan, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, and Louise Erdrich and contends that the very act of writing narrative imposes constraints upon these authors that are foreign to Native American tradition. Their works amount to a break with-and a transformation of-American Indian storytelling. The book focuses on the agenda of social and cultural regeneration encoded in contemporary Native American narrative, and addresses key questions about how these works achieve their overtly stated political and revisionary aims. Rainwater explores the ways in which the writers "create" readers who understand the connection between storytelling and personal and social transformation; considers how contemporary Native American narrative rewrites Western notions of space and time; examines the existence of intertextual connections between Native American works; and looks at the vital role of Native American literature in mainstream society today.<br>

  Chapter Two  Imagining the Stories: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhrv1">Dreams of Fiery Stars</a><br>
  Abstract: As we have seen in Chapter One, narrative management exploiting power may frustrate narrativity, the process by which a reader constructs a story based upon expectations and textual cues. Such experience, in turn, might generate in the reader an expanded repertoire of semiotic practices pertaining to texts and world. We have also seen how highly resistant narrative such as Momaday’s 
                  House Made of Dawn might drive the reader’s effort to decode the work beyond the margins of the text to extratextual references. Momaday’s is a useful technique for transforming the actual reader as thoroughly as possible into a projected, biculturally<br>

  Abstract: What kind of “other” was the resident alien within the various discursive fields of the early Roman Empire? What might a designation of “alien,” “sojourner,” or “foreigner” have meant to various audiences or readers in this context? In the second century C.E., Lucian of Samosata (or whoever the author of this epigraph may be) could offer a straightforward remark about the reproach of alien status with no need for further argument or explanation, confident that his readers would understand and agree. But what sort of reproach? Was the category of the alien a relatively neutral civic descriptor—in which case<br>

  Book Title: Detecting Texts-The Metaphysical Detective Story from Poe to Postmodernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Susan Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to
      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

  Author(s) Irwin John T.<br>
  Abstract: Let me start with a simple-minded question: How does one write analytic detective fiction as high art when the genre’s basic structure, its central narrative mechanism, seems to discourage the unlimited rereading associated with serious writing? That is, if the point of an analytic detective story is the deductive solution of a mystery, how does the writer keep the achievement of that solution from exhausting the reader’s interest in the story? How does one write a work that can be reread by people other than those with poor memories?<br>

  Abstract: The detective novel is often analyzed in terms of its metafictional and metaphysical appeal. Whether consciously or unconsciously, the genre comments upon the process of sifting through signs, and ultimately upon the possibility of deriving order from the seeming chaos of conflicting signals and motives. The unraveling work of the detective within the story mirrors and assists the work of the reader, as both try to piece together the disparate signs that might eventually solve the mystery. The reader of the detective novel comes, metafictionally, to identify with the detective, because both reader and detective are bound up in the<br>

  Author(s) Ramsay Raylene<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1950s, Alain Robbe-Grillet’s writings and films have influenced that body of French literary investigative work which reflects the “suspicion” (in Nathalie Sarraute’s sense) that the real world and natural language might be arbitrary constructions. Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

  Abstract: Special EURO 10,- discount for our ABG readers: now EURO 24,50 instead of EURO 34,50Performing the Past is an investigation of the multiple social and culture practices through which Europeans have negotiated the space between their history and their memory over the past 200 years. In museums, in opera houses, in the streets, in the schools, in theatres, in films, on the internet and beyond, narratives about the past circulate today at a dizzying speed. Producing and selling them is big business; if the past is indeed a foreign country, there are tens of thousands of tourist agents, guides, and pundits around to help us on our way, for a fee, to be sure.This collection of essays by renowned scholars from, among others, Yale, Columbia, Amsterdam Oxford, Cambridge, New York University and the European University Institute in Florence, is essential reading for anyone interested in today's memory boom. Drawing on different national and disciplinary traditions, the authors ultimately engage us with the ways in which Europeans continue a venerable tradition of finding out who they are, and where they are going, by performing the past.<br>

  Book Title: Poetry as Survival-  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.<br>

Adorno later linked his misgivings about poetry after the Holocaust to his objection to the aesthetic pleasure the reader (or spectator) experiences upon contemplating works of art that portray physical suffering: “the so-called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people being beaten to the ground by rifle-butts contains, however remotely, the power to elicit<br>

  Abstract: English printing in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries is of immense importance to the King James Bible and is perhaps one of the most overlooked or oversimplified aspects of the Bible’s origin. Of course, it is not difficult to understand why this is the case.

  The Role of the Metatexts in the King James Version as a Means of Mediating Conflicting Theological Views from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Naudé Jacobus A.<br>
  Abstract: Translations of sacred texts have often been accompanied by metatexts, which function to guide the reader in interpreting the text. The King James Version as it was originally published in 1611 included various kinds of metatexts. This paper examines three metatexts—two metatexts consisting of the two prefaces found in the preliminaries, and the set of marginal notes accompanying the translation. One preface was a three-page dedication to the king. A second, eleven-page preface to the translation articulated the aims and goals of the translators with great clarity. It also carefully specified the nature of the marginal notes as metatexts<br>

                  Eloquence, a term often associated with oratory, perhaps especially delivered orally, suggests a powerful marshalling of the resources of language to produce a persuasive effect, and that quality is manifested in verse after verse of the 1611 translation.

I continue to view it as a puzzle that admits of no simple or general answer. The very oddness of the theme ought to have inspired creative explorations, whereas, in fact, it has often given rise to evasive maneuvers. The elaboration of admittedly positive features of the disciples is, of course, very much to the point. But it has not<br>

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

  Abstract: All of Modiano’s eighteen novels to date, except for one,¹ are narrated in the first person. It is always the same kind of first person: tall, dark, reserved and slightly bumbling, he is also always engaged in a search for something in the past, either his own or someone else’s.

One reason for this is that his prose is representational, full of small and precise details in the manner of the Barthesian ‘effet de réel’. Many of these facts, moreover, have been discovered to be real; they are precise locations in Paris, or a particular brand of cigarette commonly smoked in France. Their authenticity has convinced some readers that the narrative which contains them must be a mimetic one. Another commonly held reason for considering Modiano a ‘realist’ is the combination of readability and alleged non-experimentation which characterises his novels; in<br>

  Abstract: We have now seen numerous instances of Modiano at his most subversive. The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be postmodern subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

  Author(s) Maart Rozena<br>
  Abstract: This chapter situates the subject of fiction, and the subject as writer of fiction, simultaneously. Between the two, a third emerges – the subject as critic – offering the reader a triple reading of a triple writing. It is a moment whereby to trace the trace, to trace the historical trajectory of a historical trajectory, requires that both the subject of the fiction and the subject as writer of fiction lay themselves bare on the page – reveal everything – and the critic binds and unwinds, untying the strings of history at different threads, unraveling the hidden, the forbidden, and the repressed that lie<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjcgf">Ciaran Carson</a><br>
  Abstract: The publication in 2008 of Ciaran Carson’s
                  Collected Poems, timed to coincide with the poet’s sixtieth birthday, is an obvious milestone along the way of his development as a writer. Leafing through its nearly 600 pages, which include work from eight principal collections produced over a period of more than thirty years, the reader is likely to be struck by the extraordinary scope and resourcefulness of Carson’s writing. Experimental rather than self-consciously avant-garde, Carson’s poetry exhibits a remarkable linguistic inventiveness, formal complexity, and intellectual daring, always making a concerted effort to communicate with the reader yet also foregrounding the resistances<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  Imaginative Geographies: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjcgf">Ciaran Carson</a><br>
  Abstract: The singularity of a literary work, argues Derek Attridge, is best understood as an event in which the reader experiences both inventiveness and alterity. Each reading constitutes ‘an appreciation, a living-through, of the invention that makes the work not just different but a creative reimagination of cultural materials’.¹ My contention is that the singularity of Ciaran Carson’s writing rests upon his far-reaching imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place, and particularly urban spatiality in an Irish context. It is the purpose of this chapter to set out a critical framework for exploring these engagements in their widest manifestations. Carson’s<br>

  Abstract: At the end of Volume VI of
                  The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, GentlemanLaurence Sterne’s eponymous author-narrator pauses to review his progress so far, presenting the reader with a series of visual diagrams representing the course taken by his narrative in the preceding volumes. In each of these a series of turns and detours, loops and spirals indicate the various digressions, whimsical flourishes, and redundant elaborations he has made along his meandering and pointedly non-linear way from beginning to middle to end. Moreover, in a characteristically Sternean irony, it is during this digression upon his tendency to digress<br>

  Author(s) Leservot Typhaine<br>
  Abstract: How does one introduce Maryse Condé to the uninitiated reader? Condé’s centrality to Francophone studies and her popularity outside academic circles make this question more than merely rhetorical. Indeed, her fame has spread beyond the academic circle of scholars and students in Francophone studies – far beyond, in fact. English, German, Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish translations of her work testify to her growing global audience. Her oeuvre has earned her a number of accolades that reflect her widespread appeal: the French government named her Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2001 and Chevalier de la<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Assia Djebar: from:

  Author(s) Harrison Nicholas<br>
  Abstract: Readers of a book called
                  Postcolonial Thought in the French-speaking World willexpect it to contain chapters on Fanon, Glissant, Césaire and Senghor. The reasons for including or resituating other figures as postcolonial thinkers will be clear enough. Assia Djebar, however, has written only one book that might be labelled theoretical,Ces voix qui m’assiègent … en marge de ma francophonie(Djebar, 1999b).¹ That collection, not yet translated into English, deserves to be better known, but it is primarily as a novelist that Djebar is a significant figure.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjgq5">Sympathetic Ink</a><br>
  Abstract: Although Paul Muldoon’s poetry is renowned for its erudition, allusiveness and formal precision, it is also notorious for being enigmatic and unforthcoming. A ‘Muldoonian’ poem is described thus: ‘confessional but reticent, lucid but ambiguous, idiomatic but classically formed, artless but supremely erudite, confident but self-effacing, approachable but unknowable’.² Two main strands of thought fuel the accusation that he is ‘simply’ a playful technician. First, some critics focus unduly on the Barthesian nature of his work whereby the author’s ashes rest peacefully in a well-wrought urn and authority (in every sense) passes on to the reader: ‘Far from placing writerly control<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjgq5">Sympathetic Ink</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout this monograph I have argued that for a comprehensive appreciation of Paul Muldoon and Medbh McGuckian’s poetry the reader must unearth labyrinthine networks of intertextual relations. While Muldoon’s intrusive literary allusions demand the reader’s attention, his poetry would remain opaque and open to the charge of pretentiousness if their functions and effects were not properly understood. The same is not true of McGuckian’s poetry: unaware of its true dialogism, the reader is likely to detect only disembodied voices. This work has not only introduced the reader to the capacious intellectual resources in which their poetry is grounded, it has<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Reader Keith<br>
  Abstract: Teaching and research in French cinema has developed rapidly in a relatively short time since the mid- to late 1970s. At that time, teaching was confined to the occasional course unit in a handful of universities, and research was only just starting to emerge from work aimed at cinephile rather than academic readerships. This chapter starts by considering the ways in which teaching has evolved over that time, and then gives an account of developments in research, with a strong focus on the UK, but also taking into account work done in France and the USA.<br>

  Gender and Artfulness in Rochester’s ‘Song of a Young Lady to Her Ancient Lover’ from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjm6q">Reading Rochester</a><br>
  Author(s) WILCOX HELEN<br>
  Abstract: This essay arises primarily out of the experience of discussing Rochester’s work with readers who possess plenty of ‘Youth, Fire, Wit and Discernment’, namely, fascinated but perplexed undergraduates. How does Rochester, they ask, achieve that astonishing rational directness, that surprisingly delicate lyric grace? Why does he so regularly challenge these, and his readers, with cynicism and obscenity? Is his wit sharpened in anger or love? Is it concerned or dispassionate? Is there a consistent perspective underlying and shaping the variety of poetic masks worn in and by the texts? More particularly, as a male author did he regard the human<br>

  ‘Upon Nothing’: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjm6q">Reading Rochester</a><br>
  Author(s) BARLEY TONY<br>
  Abstract: Because of its knowing exhibitionism, because of its flair, because of its mock-solemn pride in its own achievement, Rochester’s poem ‘Upon Nothing’ brushes aside the kind of readerly interrogation invited by similarly impressive metaphysical displays. If Donne’s ‘Lecture on the Shadow’ or ‘A Nocturnall upon S. Lucie’s Day’ or Marvell’s ‘Definition of Love’, provide a recent generic pedigree for ‘Upon Nothing’, Rochester’s salient improvisation on non-entity requires of its readership qualitatively less imaginative effort to succumb to its arguments and admire its paradoxes. ‘Upon Nothing’ asks, supposing it asks anything of its readers, for a take-it-or-leave-it sense of delightedly amused<br>

  1  ‘Mission Impossible?’ from:

  Abstract: V. Y. Mudimbe famously referred to Jean-Paul Sartre as ‘an African philosopher’ (
                  IoA, 83) and a ‘philosophe nègre’ (CB, 69). This unilateral africanisation of the Paris-born phenomenologist compels the reader to pause and think about the many fault lines but also intellectual and imaginary overlaps between Africa and Europe. Where does the former start and where does the latter stop? There are of course objective geographical facts and undeniable ethnic markers to corroborate the idea that Africa and Europe are distinct entities with neatly defined boundaries.

  Conclusion: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjnck">V. Y. Mudimbe</a><br>
  Abstract: ‘Reading Mudimbe’, argues Kai Kresse, ‘means engaging in an intellectual space where African studies just cannot happen in splendid isolation from other disciplines, in disjunction from the European history of the study of humanities’.¹ Indeed, V. Y. Mudimbe conjures up the image of a

The adverb ‘fabulously’ is used here to reiterate the author’s belief that essays and exegeses are also fables, that is,attemptsto translate what can, at best, only be transformed.

  Abstract: Readers of the Hebrew Bible are interested readers, bringing their own perspectives to the text. The essays in this volume, written by friends and colleagues who have drawn inspiration from and shown interest in the scholarship of David Clines, engage with his work through examining interpretations of the Hebrew Bible in areas of common exploration: literary/exegetical readings, ideological-critical readings, language and lexicography, and reception history.

  Author(s) Gillingham Susan E.<br>
  Abstract: “I stand to be corrected, but I believe that every interpretation of and commentary on this psalm ever written adopts the viewpoint of the text, and, moreover, assumes that the readers addressed by the scholarly commentator share the ideology of the text and its author.” So writes David Clines in his “Psalm 2 and the MLF (Moab Liberation Front).” ¹ A study of the reception history of this psalm undoubtedly bears this out: David is indeed one of very few to question the ideological stance of the psalmist.² He looks at Ps 2 from the point of view of its<br>

  Abstract: What do biblical scholars mean when they say that the Old Testament speaks of Yhwh as a God of pathos or passion?¹ What does this imply when God is simultaneously considered a character in the plot of a religious classic, that is, the Bible? In the studies of biblical theology by Walter Brueggemann and Jack Miles,² the God of pathos belongs to the writer’s religious dictionary. Brueggemann strongly emphasizes the idiom that the Bible is “speech about God.” In his view this means that “Yahweh lives in, with, and under this speech”; and we, its readers, should feel urged to<br>

In this essay I will engage with only two versions of the argument and make some observations on the relationships between them. In one version, which might be termed

This issue may look like a mere technicality, of no interest for exegesis, history of religion, and literary criticism, but actually it is of highest importance, for it relates to the status of the speaking characters. On the face of it, the matter seems rather trivial: when the participants in the dialogue are unknown to the reader, they are to be mentioned by name and/or title, for the sake of clarity; but when it is clear whose move it is, no explicit indication is necessary.

  Author(s) Benton Steve<br>
  Abstract: In his classic study
                  Love and Death in the American Novel(1960), literary critic Leslie Fiedler famously describes Washington Irving’s “Rip Van Winkle” (1819) as the foundational text of American literature because the civilization-shunning character it celebrates is the “typical male protagonist of our fiction.” That protagonist, Fiedler claims, is typically “a man on the run, harried into the forest and out to sea, down the river or into combat—anywhere to avoid ‘civilization.’ ”¹ As Fiedler points out, civilization-scorners like Irving’s Rip have long evoked sympathy in American readers because we are suspicious of intellectuals and other fancy-pants civilizers.<br>

The transit prison with its abusive guards was a genuine ordeal; life in exile turned out to be less hard.

  Abstract: All authors confront an empty page that needs to be filled with words, just as all struggle from paragraph to paragraph in deciding how much information the reader requires to understand settings, plots, and characters. Tolstoy was different from most in his extensive use of that which cannot be said or written as the negative space against which his fiction takes shape. For example, in

  Abstract: Tolstoy’s authorial personality, even in the antipoetic guise quoted above, was the fruit of much thought and creative imagination. He considered how his fiction created a public perception of him, and realized that perception would affect how people read his fiction. A work of literature invariably presents some kind of image of the author to the reader, and publication is an opportunity for authors to shape and manage their presentation of a self. What kind of self does Tolstoy craft for his reader? Neither an entirely accessible, unmediated essence (an ideal of the diary), nor an opaque and impersonal source<br>

  6  The Recovery of Childhood from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkwn0">Leo Tolstoy and the Alibi of Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: Tolstoy’s early stories use misdirection, diversion, in order to create the experience of real presentness for the reader, who, happily distracted, passes into a world of fiction perhaps without realizing it. The late stories, on the contrary, often feign the simplicity of pure readerly experience, while alienating that experience through complex narrative structures. In the former, Tolstoy struggles against the alibi of narrative, continually collapsing the distance between “elsewhere” and the present “here.” In the latter, however, Tolstoy raises a narrative barrier to purely present meaning; and though his stories often contain what should be a simple moral meaning, they<br>

Everything seems “dreadful” and “incomprehensible” to her as she loses herself in feelings of loneliness and estrangement.

Although her writing is well known for its difficulty, Morrison has given enough explanatory interviews to fill two volumes, both extensively cited despite the humble, homey “conversations” intimated by their titles.¹ Morrison’s “conversational” appearances on the Oprah Winfrey show also dramatize an anxious negotiation of readers’ desire to know and the author’s will to tell.² With stunning audacity, Morrison even interpreted her own novels in her Tanner lecture at the University of Michigan in 1988.

I pursue this question through Jonathan Safran Foer’s 2005

Does the writer intend for the reader to understand that the willful placement of words, sentences, paragraphs, and even chapters are themselves valuable insights to the meaning of the text as a whole? For example, does rereading Numbers 19 and 20 provide a “
                  remez”—a hint—of a deeper meaning of these enigmatic chapters? In Numbers 19 we read of theparah adumah, the Red Heifer, a paradoxical ritual that need only be described as achok, a biblical commandment that has no rationale except being<br>

  Abstract: The Book of Jeremiah is unique among the prophetic books insofar as it presents the oracles and activities of the only one of the prophets to live through the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem. Other prophets may have lived through such catastrophe, for example, Ezekiel received the news of Jerusalem’s fall while living in Babylonian exile, and Isaiah lived at the time of Samaria’s fall to the Assyrian empire, but Jeremiah is the only prophetic book to give its readers a glimpse of life in the doomed city and the struggles in which its inhabitants engaged as they faced<br>

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: Without these detailed case studies of the impact of sentimental postmodernism upon readers and viewers, an analysis of the politics of this hybrid style would be incomplete and highly speculative. My contextual and empirical work with audiences is crucial to the conclusion that much of the political power of sentimental postmodernism can be found in the intense identifications that it fosters both within and across sexual identities, genders, and ethnicities. Much of the current critical work about identification has been produced by textual scholars writing from psychoanalytic perspectives. While these textual theorists have given us valuable insights concerning the ambivalent<br>

  Chapter Four  Writing from:

  Abstract: Writing simultaneously celebrates and questions the metaphysical foundations of Western thought. It asserts the tangibility of the subject that performs the act of writing but it also exposes the limitations of this very subjectivity. When we talk about writing we speak of a corporality mediated through ideas and inscribed in language. We do not see the author who writes, we only hear and listen to the language resonating on the page. The concrete meeting we experience as readers is with the author's language. It is indeed instructive that recent critical trends in literary study—in particular in the study of<br>

  Book Title: Japanese Philosophy-A Sourcebook<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Maraldo John C.<br>
  Abstract: With
      Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook,readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time.TheSourcebookeditors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition-not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics.An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index.Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use,Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebookwill be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come. It will be an essential reference for anyone interested in traditional or contemporary Japanese culture and the way it has shaped and been shaped by its great thinkers over the centuries.24 illus.<br>

These stories explain particular histories by juxtaposing public events with private experiences, to reveal the ways families construct (or reconstruct) identity within the experience of diaspora. Giving a sense of cohesion and closure to the lives of grandparents and parents can establish a sense of authority and meaning to the writer’s own life story.

  Book Title: On Diary-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DURNIN KATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: On Diary is the second collection in English of the groundbreaking and profoundly influential work of one of the best-known and provocative theorists of autobiography and diary. Ranging from the diary’s historical origins to its pervasive presence on the Internet, from the spiritual journey of the sixteenth century to the diary of Anne Frank, and from the materials and methods of diary writing to the question of how diaries end, these essays display Philippe Lejeune’s expertise, eloquence, passion, and humor as a commentator on the functions, practices, and significance of keeping or reading a diary. Lejeune is a leading European critic and theorist of diary and autobiography. His landmark essay, "The Autobiographical Pact," has shaped life writing studies for more than thirty years, and his many books and essays have repeatedly opened up new vistas for scholarship. As Michael Riffaterre notes, "Lejeune’s work on autobiography is the most original, powerful, effective approach to a difficult subject. . . . His style is very personal, lively. It grabs the reader as scholarship rarely does. Lejeune’s erudition and methodology are impeccable." Two substantial introductory essays by Jeremy Popkin and Julie Rak place Lejeune’s work within its critical and theoretical traditions and comment on his central importance within the fields of life writing, literary genetic studies, and cultural studies.<br>

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences. The book moves from a description of the roles of xian and xian-seekers to an account of how individuals filled these roles, whether by their own agency or by others’—or, often, by both. Campany summarizes the repertoire of features that constituted xian roles and presents a detailed example of what analyses of those cultural repertoires look like. He charts the functions of a basic dialectic in the self-presentations of adepts and examines their narratives and relations with others, including family members and officials. Finally, he looks at hagiographies as attempts to persuade readers as to the identities and reputations of past individuals. His interpretation of these stories allows us to see how reputations were shaped and even co-opted—sometimes quite surprisingly—into the ranks of xian. Making Transcendents provides a nuanced discussion that draws on a sophisticated grasp of diverse theoretical sources while being thoroughly grounded in traditional Chinese hagiographical, historiographical, and scriptural texts. The picture it presents of the quest for transcendence as a social phenomenon in early medieval China is original and provocative, as is the paradigm it offers for understanding the roles of holy persons in other societies.<br>

With one arm they coax the readers, imploring them to read on, promising treasures in the pages that stretch ahead. With the other arm, they pull back, warning that the offerings are frail, that they falter here or there. Hubris makes her claims, just as humility softens, or even retracts, them.

  Abstract: On the back cover of the English edition of
                  The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below(2000), Alberto Moreiras characterizes Jose María Arguedas’s novel as “epochal” and “intense enough to arrest our world, and any world.” Today few critical readers would object to that description, but when the novel was published in 1971, reactions were mixed. The novel’s form and content, the wild proliferation of unpredictable characters, and what was perceived as a deep-seated pessimism were all difficult to reconcile with the image of Arguedas as a major cultural icon of progressive Peruvian culture.

  Author(s): Rigby Kate<br>
  Abstract: One of the more frequently lodged, serious, and justifiable complaints about ecocritical work is that it is insufficiently theorized.
      Ecocritical Theoryputs such claims decisively to rest by offering readers a comprehensive collection of sophisticated but accessible essays that productively investigate the relationship between European theory and ecocritique. With its international roster of contributors and subjects, it also militates against the parochialism of ecocritics who work within the limited canon of the American West. Bringing together approaches and orientations based on the work of European philosophers and cultural theorists, this volume is designed to open new pathways for ecocritical theory and practice in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KORT WESLEY A.<br>
  Abstract: Given its affinity with questions of identity, autobiography offers a way into the interior space between author and reader, especially when writers define themselves in terms of religion. In his exploration of this "textual intimacy," Wesley Kort begins with a theorization of what it means to say who one is and how one's self-account as a religious person stands in relation to other forms of self-identification. He then provides a critical analysis of autobiographical texts by nine contemporary American writers-including Maya Angelou, Philip Roth, and Anne Lamott-who give religion a positive place in their accounts of who they are. Finally, in disclosing his own religious identity, Kort concludes with a meditation on several meanings of the word

  3  DISCLOSING A RELIGIOUS IDENTITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrjgw">Textual Intimacy</a><br>
  Abstract: We should not be surprised, while reading the autobiographies of fellow Americans, to encounter religious self-disclosures. After all, roughly 85 percent of Americans self-identify as religious. In addition, religion is so pervasive in our society that the life of any American is likely to include references to religion in some form and degree or other. American autobiographies that include religious disclosures are not exceptional, then. Conversely, autobiographies that include religious self-disclosures are potentially engaging to American readers because they themselves are likely to have had to deal with religion as part of their pasts, their current interactions, or their thoughts<br>

  Book Title: Doing Justice to Mercy-Religion, Law, and Criminal Justice<br>

  Author(s): Jung Kevin<br>
  Abstract: It is often assumed that the law and religion address different spheres of human life. Religion and ethics articulate complex systems of moral reasoning that concern norms, deliberation of ends, cultivation of disposition, and transformation of moral agency. Law, in contrast, seeks to govern human conduct through procedural justice, rights, and public good. Doing Justice to Mercy challenges this assumption by presenting the reader with an urgent conversation between the law and religion that yields a constructive approach, both theoretically and practically, to the complex role of mercy in our legal process.<br>

The 1850s were, after all, a grim period of political reentrenchment following the failures of the revolutions of 1848, and the time was ripe for the sour pessimism and disillusionment with reason expressed in his philosophy of the irrational will.

  CHAPTER 6  Aesthetic Solutions from:

  Abstract: As writers, the Historians of Religions presented readers with a model impossible to copy. That is, while their creations were “about” religion, neither their writings nor the forms of religion they described were, in any direct sense, replicable by the reader. This irreproducibility, I suggest, echoes their very modernity as writers. The History of Religions, in form and in content, positioned itself to be unparalleled, unique, autonomous, a species of one—just as did modern art and the modern artist. This parallel is particularly significant because it was on this basis that the foundational claim for the autonomy of religion<br>

  Abstract: A stumbling block often encountered by new readers of Mircea Eliade is the discovery that the History of Religions oddly is defined by its opposition to history. Gershom Scholem’s version of History of Religions seemed to obviate this dilemma, inasmuch as he championed historical research and the historical method. Henry Corbin used a variety of terms, such as “imaginal” and “prophetic,” to characterize his stridently antihistoricist Islamic studies. But all three shared a developed interest in metahistory. Both Scholem and Corbin thus spoke of “historiosophy.” They also spoke of their own work in terms of a kind of “counter-history.”¹ Corbin<br>

  Book Title: The Undivine Comedy-Detheologizing Dante<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): BAROLINI TEODOLINDA<br>
  Abstract: Accepting Dante's prophetic truth claims on their own terms, Teodolinda Barolini proposes a "detheologized" reading as a global new approach to the
      Divine Comedy. Not aimed at excising theological concerns from Dante, this approach instead attempts to break out of the hermeneutic guidelines that Dante structured into his poem and that have resulted in theologized readings whose outcomes have been overdetermined by the poet. By detheologizing, the reader can emerge from this poet's hall of mirrors and discover the narrative techniques that enabled Dante to forge a true fiction. Foregrounding the formal exigencies that Dante masked as ideology, Barolini moves from the problems of beginning to those of closure, focusing always on the narrative journey. Her investigation--which treats such topics as the visionary and the poet, the One and the many, narrative and time--reveals some of the transgressive paths trodden by a master of mimesis, some of the ways in which Dante's poetic adventuring is indeed, according to his own lights, Ulyssean.<br>

Yet it is one of the paradoxes of the poem that, in the very aftermath of Satan’s success, the poem manages to detach itself from the dominance of Satan, and continues thereafter as a very different, and what some readers find a much duller, poem. The change happens in Book 10. The two plots, divine and earthly, linked in Book 9, now diverge, and we see by contrasts. While Satan returns in<br>

  Abstract: In Welsh's book, readers are invited on Freud's journey, to pause at each concealed pass in his seminal work and ask where the guide is taking them and why. Along the way, Welsh shows how Freud's arbitrary turnings are themselves wishful, intended to persuade by pleasing the reader and author alike; that his interest in secrets and his self-proclaimed modest ambition are products of their time; and that the book may best be read as a romance or serial comedy. "Some of the humor throughout," Welsh notes, "can only be understood as a particular kind of fine performance." Welsh offers the first critical overview of the argument in Freud's masterpiece and of the author who presents himself as guide.<br>

  Abstract: Though trained psychoanalysts often say that chapter 7 delivers the important lessons of

One of the ways Freud most pleases—however testily he complained about supposed indiscretions—is by confession of his own dreams. These dreams, with the background and analysis he provides, are absorbing in themselves and partially linked up as autobiography. Only the naive or the doctrinaire, however, can suppose that the success of this broken narrative is due to its honesty per se. Confessions are by definition formally honest, since unless they reveal what<br>

  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

  8  THE PENNY PRESS AND ITS READERS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ssdz">Cultures in Flux</a><br>
  Author(s) Brower Daniel R.<br>
  Abstract: In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the Russian penny press became a cultural bridge between writers and the urban population. It was a far more visible presence than the chapbooks, which until then had been the sole print medium to reach large numbers of readers. The penny press was an innovation both because it threw out a daily barrage of images, stories, and news reports, and because it cast an inquisitive, at times accusatory light on public and private behavior in the capitals and in provincial cities. The message was often sensationalist, invariably personalized and localized, and usually<br>

  Book Title: The Harmony of Illusions-Inventing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Young Allan<br>
  Abstract: This book is part history and part ethnography, and it includes a detailed account of everyday life in the treatment of Vietnam veterans with PTSD. To illustrate his points, Young presents a number of fascinating transcripts of the group therapy and diagnostic sessions that he observed firsthand over a period of two years. Through his comments and the transcripts themselves, the reader becomes familiar with the individual hospital personnel and clients and their struggle to make sense of life after a tragic war. One observes that everyone on the unit is heavily invested in the PTSD diagnosis: boundaries between therapist and patient are as unclear as were the distinctions between victim and victimizer in the jungles of Southeast Asia.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sz2j">Anthropos Today</a><br>
  Abstract: This book is proposed as a meditation on Michel Foucault’s claim that “equipment is the medium of transformation of logos into ethos.” A good deal of work is required, however, to grasp what such a claim might mean. The difficulty in part lies in the fact that the terms “equipment” and “meditation” are used in a distinctive technical sense. Furthermore, why one would want to transform “logos” into “ethos” equally requires explanation. Hence the reader is alerted that reading this book will require a certain patience. Additionally, and unexpectedly, the book addresses the reader as a friend. Initially this appellation<br>

  CHAPTER EIGHT  Heil to the Chief: from:

  Abstract: In this chapter I compare Sinclair Lewis’s
                  It Can’t Happen Here, published in 1935, with Philip Roth’sThe Plot Against America, published in 2004.¹ The former looks ahead to the 1936 presidential election and the victory of the fictional fascist Senator Buzz Windrip over President Franklin Roosevelt. The latter looks back to the 1940 election to imagine Roosevelt’s defeat by aviator Charles A. Lindbergh, whose administration is isolationist abroad and anti-Semitic at home. The two authors conjure up “fascist” regimes for different purposes, and reviewers—and presumably readers—responded to them differently. The two novels only address international relationsen<br>

  Abstract: THIS INQUIRY into the referential aesthetic of autobiography attempts to answer a question that has haunted me for a long time: why should it make a difference to me that autobiographies are presumably based in biographical fact? This is really another way of asking why people read autobiographies, a question intimately linked to the question of why people write them. There seems to be no doubt that readers do read autobiographies differently from other kinds of texts, especially from works they take to be “fictions.” All who have studied the reading of autobiography agree that reference lies at the heart<br>

  Book Title: Mappings-Feminism and the Cultural Geographies of Encounter<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): FRIEDMAN SUSAN STANFORD<br>
  Abstract: In this powerful work, Susan Friedman moves feminist theory out of paralyzing debates about us and them, white and other, first and third world, and victimizers and victims. Throughout, Friedman adapts current cultural theory from global and transnational studies, anthropology, and geography to challenge modes of thought that exaggerate the boundaries of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and national origin. The author promotes a transnational and heterogeneous feminism, which, she maintains, can replace the proliferation of feminisms based on difference. She argues for a feminist geopolitical literacy that goes beyond fundamentalist identity politics and absolutist poststructuralist theory, and she continually focuses the reader's attention on those locations where differences are negotiated and transformed.<br>

  Abstract: Helping people makes you feel good. This is the message we hear again and again from volunteer agencies and fund-raisers. A Christian magazine with a large national circulation recently carried an advertisement by a well-known international relief agency. At the top was the familiar face of a needy child, dark-skinned, with large, sad eyes. Beside her picture in bold, black, underlined letters half an inch high was the word sponsorship. Below this, filling up nearly a quarter of the page in equally huge letters, were the words

  1  The Language of Love: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zsk3">Writing Lovers</a><br>
  Abstract: In his essay “On Love,” Adam Phillips observes that since the language of love borrows its referents from the discourses of theology and epistemology, it is at once relentlessly redemptive and insistently enlightening (40). The lover, like the mystic or the paranoiac, is a reader of signs and wonders: all are terrorized and bewitched by an experience that, in the absence of a transcendental signifier, displaces our contemporary version of the sublime. If this comparison is to provide a useful analogy, then it is possible to concede that we have, in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, enshrined literature<br>

At the same time the reader learns that the murder of an unknown girl has taken place, a murder that is never resolved but that serves as a warning against all unknown “prowlers.” YetThe Prowleris also, indeed mostly, about love as what Gunnars’ narrator names that “vulnerable territory”<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  Poetic Argument from:

  Abstract: This book is a defence of reason in poetry. It does not follow the “moralistic” and “absolutist” principles proposed by Yvor Winters in
                  In Defense of Reason; it is closer to the cautionary critique of avant-garde “unreality” offered more recently by Gerald Graff inLiterature Against Itself. My main purpose is to trace the fate of reason as it engages in and is challenged by the arguments of modernist poetry. Such poetry argues with itself, within itself, with its resources, with its author, and with its readers. As I intend to show, it grows argumentative by making paradoxical demands of<br>

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  CHAPTER TEN  Play with Closure in Petrushevskaia’s “The New Robinsons” and Kabakov’s “The Deserter” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztgwq">Russian Experimental Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: Meta-utopian fiction written since 1987 is, as might be expected, more radically reductive than its forebears, finding naked coercion behind all but the most locally defined ideologies. It exposes a similar matrix of responses as the critical discussion about utopia. On the one hand, it harbors the same fear of the abyss as the only real alternative to stable, if oppressive, order, while, on the other, it is strongly concerned with reopening language to untried possibility, with reexamining deep social scripts, and with probing automatized readerly expectations.

  Abstract: The epic poet builds a world into his poem and makes it palpable through passages of varying emotional timbre, now pastoral, now contemplative, now devotional, now celebratory, now tragic. But he builds that world as understandable in terms of the best information or knowledge available to him. Epic places human beings within a cosmos; Milton writes for an audience interested in that cosmos not simply as a storehouse for metaphor but as a structure under investigation by the liveliest minds of his age. He designs his diffuse epic to engage the interest of the seventeenth-century reader in geography, medicine, astronomy,<br>

  Book Title: Poetry, Word-Play, and Word-War in Wallace Stevens-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): COOK ELEANOR<br>
  Abstract: In the first full-length study of Wallace Stevens's word-play, Eleanor Cook focuses on Stevens's skillful play with grammar, etymology, allusion, and other elements of poetry, and suggests ways in which this play offers a method of approaching his work. At the same time, this book is a general study of Stevens's poetry, moving from his earliest to his latest work, and includes close readings of three of his remarkable long poems--Esthetique du Mal, Notes toward a Supreme Fiction, and An Ordinary Evening in New Haven. The chronological arrangement enables readers to follow Stevens's increasing skill and changing thought in three areas of his "poetry of the earth": the poetry of place, the poetry of eros, and the poetry of belief.<br>

  Abstract: I need to say a number of things all at once, because readers come to word-play with such different assumptions. So I shall say them briefly, then speak in a general way about word-play, before proceeding to an outline of this book, and then to some specialized matters. First, the simple and important point that Stevens liked word-play because it is often wonderfully funny. We sometimes read him a shade solemnly.

  Abstract: The insights presented in the volume are many and wide-ranging, recognizably in tune with the subtlest modern discussions of desire (such as triangulation. or loving what others love), yet offering new solutions to old problems, like the proper interpretation of Plato's Phaedrus. On the frequently discussed effect of literacy on Greek civilization, the book offers a fresh view: it was no accident that the poets who invented Eros were also the first readers and writers of the Western literate tradition.<br>

  Abstract: ‘Letters’ (
                  grammata) can mean ‘letters of the alphabet’ and also ‘epistles’ in Greek as in English. Novels contain letters of both kinds, and offer two different perspectives on the blind point of desire. Letters in the broad sense, that is to say the floating ruse of the novel as a written text, provide erotic tension on the level of the reading experience. There is a triangular circuit running from the writer to the reader to the characters in the story; when its circuit-points connect, the difficult pleasure of paradox can be felt like an electrification. Letters in the narrower sense,<br>

  Abstract: From the time of its earliest use the technique of writing and reading was appreciated by the ancients as an apparatus of privacy or secrecy. All communication is to some extent public in a society without writing. Certainly a message sent by herald and declaimed in the open air is a less private communiqué than a letter written for your eyes alone to read. Early readers and writers seem to have been intensely aware of this difference. There is an ancient riddle, attributed to Sappho, that expresses their attitude:<br>

  Abstract: The static blooms of Adonis provide us with an answer to our question ‘What would the lover ask of time?’ As Plato formulates it, the answer brings us once again to the perception that lovers and readers have very similar desires. And the desire of each is something paradoxical. As lover you want ice to
                  beice and yet not melt in your hands. As reader you want knowledge tobeknowledge and yet lie fixed on a written page. Such wants cannot help but pain you, at least in part, because they place you at a blind point from<br>

In Sokrates’ view, a truelogoshas this in common with a real love affair, that it must be lived out in time. It is not the same backwards as forwards, it cannot be entered at any point, or frozen at its acme, or dismissed when fascination falters.

  Book Title: Poetics of Reading-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMMERS INGE CROSMAN<br>
  Abstract: What happens when we read novels and how do we make sense of them? Inge Wimmers explores these questions by developing a flexible poetics of reading that generously opens up the interpretive space between reader and text, while drawing on current theories of reading and combining rhetorical, pragmatic, and phenomenological approaches. "Poetics," here, is extended beyond the study of purely textual features to structures of exchange between text and reader. In a discussion of four major French novels from the seventeenth century to the present, the author not only sets up a broad-based poetics but also makes important contributions to contemporary issues in the study of narrative. Wimmers introduces the concept of multiple, interlocking frames of reference that allows for the integration of diverse critical perspectives. Analyzing La Princesse de Cleves, Madame Bovary, A la recherche du temps perdu, and Projet pour une revolution a New York, she shows how texts provide some frames of reference, while others are produced by the reader's disposition and cultural milieu.<br>

The question seemed straightforward enough to me at first, though I knew that to define reading I would have to extricate myself from a jungle of conflicting theories.

  Abstract: When
                  La Princesse de Clèveswas first published in March 1678, it gave rise to lively discussions. Of major interest in these first responses to the book was the behavior of its central character, the princess. A telling example is the poll organized byLe Mercure Galantthat asked its readers whether Mme. de Clèves was right to tell her husband about her love for the due de Nemours. The majority thought not. Her conduct seemed implausible, since according to social custom (the well-established code ofbienséance), such behavior was not sanctioned.¹ Readers of the time did not ask themselves<br>

  THREE  Madame Bovary or the Dangers of Misreading from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv2nc">Poetics of Reading</a><br>
  Abstract: Though the novel’s title focuses the reader’s attention on what he may well expect to be its central subject, such expectations are frustrated from the start, since the opening chapters focus on Charles, not Emma. Nor is this narrative focus a stable one, as soon becomes evident when other disconcerting hurdles are encountered. Through jarring contrasts and shifting perspectives, Flaubert’s reader is soon drawn into a more active, hermeneutic reading; the central question is no longer “What will happen next?” but, rather, “Why are things told that way?” This heightened attention to narrative form takes us beyond the story world<br>

  Abstract: What is it to read novels? This is the question asked at the outset of this study. It is clear by now that there is no one simple answer. Readings differ depending on the kind of novel being read and the reader’s purpose, interests, and ideology. By opening the interpretive space between reader and text to include both text interpretation and self-interpretation, the frames of reference that come into play are multiplied. Moreover, the emphasis in recent theories of reading on emotional response—in particular the enjoyment readers get from taking an active part—opens up new directions for a<br>

Thus references to reality in fiction have their function in a poetics of fiction that might aim at reality and the collective experience of reality to a greater or lesser degree.

  Abstract: After a long period when the Real (I prefer Actual) Author had been enthroned by criticism, his every “laundry-list” (as Pound called biography) scrutinized, he was, in true carnivalesque fashion, unthroned, the wild and happy crowd of Actual Readers taking over—but, as is the way with carnival, only for a time. Extremes bring natural reactions, and the two polarities, called at the time the Intentional and the Affective Fallacies, seem to have compromised on a safe buffer state called The Text as Object, an apparently autonomous unit that encodes both its author (implied), or addresser, and its reader (implied),<br>

  Do Readers Make Meaning? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv3jc">The Reader in the Text</a><br>
  Author(s) Crosman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The question is itself annoyingly vague and ambiguous, yet it is as close as I can get to expressing what seems to me the central issue of literary theory today. When Jonathan Culler calls for a “theory of reading,” when Stanley Fish speaks of “reading communities” and “reading strategies,” when Jacques Derrida announces that “the reader writes the text,” they are all, in varying degrees, answering in the affirmative. And when other theorists—Wayne Booth, E. D. Hirsch, and a host of others—see solipsism and moral chaos in such an answer, they too are testifying to the importance of<br>

  Toward a Sociology of Reading from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv3jc">The Reader in the Text</a><br>
  Author(s) Suleiman Susan R.<br>
  Abstract: When raising the question of the reader’s status in the text, we may have in mind two sets of problems. According to one approach, the reader is thought of as an end conceived by the writer, whose work, accordingly, may be read in reference to the idea we have of that reader. A certain number of studies have enriched the history of literary criticism in this way, showing that the expectations of a particular public aimed at by the writer were determinative down to the most secret strata of the text (Jauss’s
                     Erwartungshorizontfor example).<br>

  Author(s) Prince Gerald<br>
  Abstract: Reading is an activity that presupposes a text (a set of visually presented linguistic symbols from which meaning can be extracted), a reader (an agent capable of extracting meaning from that text), and an interaction between the text and the reader such that the latter is able to answer correctly at least some questions about the meaning of the former.

  Author(s) Beaujour Michel<br>
  Abstract: In order to avoid the kind of frivolity that holds ethical concerns to be irrelevant in a discussion of the reader in (of) texts, it may be wise to revisit briefly the Russian critical tradition. This tradition has entertained with high seriousness the notion—somewhat disreputable in the West—that literature, and particularly fiction, must be held accountable, since it encodes messages which affect not only the subjective world view of readers, but their attitudes and actions. Novels are presumed capable of endangering (or reinforcing) the structure of society and the legal order.¹ Rufus Mathewson’s analysis of Russian radical poetics<br>

  Abstract: A critic interested in how we read nouveaux romans might very well be allergic to terms like
                  convention, naturalhation,andliterary competence.Being institutional, conventions rest upon a foundation that smacks uncomfortably of the “dominant ideology” so often decried by Ricardou and his disciples. Naturalization involves constructing “communicative circuits”¹ into which we can fit a literary text; the nouveau roman officially rejects the idea of literature as communication.² And although the reader’s intertext has been invoked as an important factor in processing a given text,³ the model of literary competence has been challenged by that of performance, presumably less<br>

  AFTERWORD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv4x4">The Skeptic Disposition</a><br>
  Abstract: The Skeptic Dispositionwas written in the early eighties during the heyday of deconstruction and reader-centered criticism. The scene has changed, but the critical orientation represented by these “movements” has not disappeared. Rather it has been sublimated and to an extent transformed in the “ideology critique” that dominates literary studies at this moment. The most enduring effect of deconstruction has been the subversion of all universalist or foundationalist claims to truth. In the Marxist canon, ideology has as one of its principal meanings “false consciousness,” which is a kind of universalizing thought that conceals the particular, self-interested (class) motives that<br>

  Abstract: Great books are less written than they are read. That is, designations of qualitative status (good, bad, indifferent, classic, or a waste of trees) are less simple descriptions of the facts of authorial achievement than they are evocations of the expectations and criteria of judgment the reader brings to bear upon a text. These constitute what, I shall call
                  appraisive fields. On occasion we may find such fields specific to a discipline or activity in which we place a book—hence we do not read a viticultural treatise as we would a pastoral idyll. Commonly, however, our expectations are abridged<br>

  Abstract: Much has happened in Dinesen criticism in North America since Robert Langbaum launched his ground breaking study
                     The Gayety of Visionin 1964.This book opened up the academic world in North America to an interest in the fiction of Danish writer Karen Blixen whose chosen pen name for her English speaking readers was Isak Dinesen. It is beyond the scope of this brief introduction to list the considerable amount of criticism published since then, but for the purposes of situating the resent collection of Dinesen criticism in context, the following important factors should be mentioned.<br>

  Methods of Narratology and Rhetoric for Analyzing Isak Dinesen’s “The Blank Page” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvc7">Isak Dinesen and Narrativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Halsall Albert W.<br>
  Abstract: The principal problem posed by Dinesen's story, “The Blank Page” is one of
                  ethos. Put very simply, and as Dinesen quite accurately foresaw, in my view, the story's credibility or plausibility is the problem most likely to trouble readers whose ideological presuppositions do not commit them to reading it as a tract, feminist or otherwise. To prove my thesis, I will have recourse to two critical methods which should, I hope, function as symbiotic agents of analysis. Formal narratology, of the sort developed by French Structuralists like Barthes, Genette and theÉcole de Paris, enables one to describe the text's<br>

  The Silent Tale: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvc7">Isak Dinesen and Narrativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Kemp Mark A.<br>
  Abstract: In his analysis of a short narrative text which ends ambiguously,Umberto Eco concludes that the story being told is actually the story of the reader’s failure in reading the story.¹ This “naive” reader’s complacent acceptance of narrative conventions and ideological assumptions deliberately inscribed in the text leads to an impasse in interpretation. Instead of the expected denouement there is an impossible, or paradoxical, outcome. Only a critical reading, such as the one performed in “
                  Lector in Fabula,” can overcome the frustrated conventional reading and detect the “pragmatic strategy” in the text. By self-critical I mean both the text's criticism of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvc7">Isak Dinesen and Narrativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Gheorghe Cristina<br>
  Abstract: The paper explores the ironic narrative strategies used by Isak Dinesen to construct and deconstruct, authenticate and disauthenticate her fictional world, as illustrated by the short story “The Monkey.” In examining this short story and through reference to instances from other stories, I will point out Dinesen's disauthenticating technique in light of Derrida's philosophic strategy of deconstruction. My main concern here is, however, possibleworld semantics. The term deconstruction will be used as authorialde construction, applied by Dinesen in her specific narrative technique, and lectorial deconstruction—this reader's response to Dinesen's deconstructive technique which reveals in her literary discourse analogies to<br>

  Chapter 3  COGNITION AND CULT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvdgf">History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance</a><br>
  Abstract: Thus far, we have asserted that digesting history employed ways of thinking common to the arts of imagination. We have identified some characteristics of those patterns of thought in the mutual reflection of verbal and visual images, an interplay that enabled readers to construct unity in the gaps between the fragments that made up the text. In this way, we have begun to recover some invisible “transitions” like those which John Scotus Eriugena considered as providing a hidden framing structure in some parables (see Preface, n. 2). We are now in a position to examine, more precisely, the acts of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvdgf">History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance</a><br>
  Abstract: Historical texts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries are, on the whole, accumulations of anecdotes. They lack the fundamental elements of narrative wholeness—a beginning, middle, and end—and they flagrantly defy the canons of proportion and clarity. And yet I have argued in this study concerning the Kingdom of God, their segmented and directionless mode of discourse was possible because it was, for the authors and the intended readers, informed by a general esthetic, namely, an esthetic of cult, which presupposed much that was unsaid in the said, including an acceptance of violence (beginning with sacrifice) as a medium<br>

  Abstract: Thus far we have concentrated on the epistemological and psychological basis of Blake’s symbols. We shall now move toward an examination of the myth in which he organized them, and raise more directly the problem of interpretation in its dual form: Blake’s understanding of his symbols’ meaning, and the various kinds of understanding that modern readers bring to them. I propose to begin by considering some representative modern theories of symbolism, taking care at each point to note essential differences from Blake’s theory, but at the same time establishing perspectives that will help to illuminate the peculiar difficulties of his<br>

  Book Title: Neverending Stories-Toward a Critical Narratology<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

  FOUR  MOCKING A MOCK-BIOGRAPHY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvn6q">Neverending Stories</a><br>
  Author(s) Rieckmann Jens<br>
  Abstract: When steven millhauser’s first novel,
                  Edwin Mullhouse: The Life and Death of an American Writer (1943–1954), by Jeffrey Cartwrightwas published in 1972, several reviewers remarked on its Nabokovian qualities and pointed toPale Fireas the most likely model for Millhauser’s mock-biography.¹ The very tide of Millhauser’s novel, however, seems to point to another possible model: Thomas Mann’sDoctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkühn, as Told by a Friend.In fact, a comparison of these two fictional witness biographies leads this reader to conclude that Millhauser’s novel, in some of its themes and motives<br>

  Abstract: Wolfgang hildesheimer’s latest book,

But its unconventionality is not without pitfalls, and thus it presents us with a difficult case for interpretation and evaluation. This only becomes completely clear if we put ourselves in the position of a reader fifty or one hundred years hence, when it is no longer possible to set up television interviews with the author, or indeed to ask him any<br>

  Author(s) Stanzel Franz K.<br>
  Abstract: It is, of course, the king’s nonchalant presupposition that “the end” requires no further definition that encapsulates one of the most intractable problems of narrative theory: what is a proper ending of a story, and what does it do to the reader? Since Frank Kermode’s

  Abstract: Once upon a time, fictional narrators freely dispensed moral, aesthetic, and philosophical insights for readers who readily attributed these to the authors. But Henry James, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and other modernist followers of Flaubert muzzled their narrators and dissociated themselves from the narrative voice.<br>

  FOURTEEN  NO NO NANA: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvn6q">Neverending Stories</a><br>
  Author(s) Mickelsen David<br>
  Abstract: Nana, Emile Zola’s 1880 portrayal of courtesan life during the Second Empire, is a novel dominated by sustained waiting. Readers of novels, especially nineteenth-century readers and readers of nineteenth-century novels, have been schooled to seek closure—to overcome gaps, domesticate the unfamiliar, establish connections and coherence, understand motives, and anticipate climax. InNanaone can indeed engage these goals, but only at a relatively general level; the text prevents a narrower application of that understanding, despite the personal focus implied by eponymy. For all its proliferation of data, this novel expands without quite filling out a portrait of Nana herself.<br>

  Abstract: Most readers naturally assume that all autobiographies are based on the verifiable facts of a life history, and it is this referential dimension, imperfectly understood, that has checked the development of a poetics of autobiography. Historians and social scientists attempt to isolate the factual content of autobiography from its narrative matrix, while literary critics, seeking to promote the appreciation of autobiography as an imaginative art, have been willing to treat such texts as though they were indistinguishable from novels. Autobiographers themselves, of course, are responsible for the problematical reception of their work, for they perform willy-nilly both as artists and<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Henry James and the Autobiographical Act from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvs6h">Fictions in Autobiography</a><br>
  Abstract: Roy Pascal has observed that autobiography involves an interplay or collusion between the past and the present, that indeed its significance is more truly understood as the revelation of the present situation of the autobiographer than as the uncovering of his past.¹ As readers of autobiography we ordinarily do need to be reminded of this obvious truth, even though Freud and his followers have shaken our faith in the ability of memory to provide reliable access to the contents of the past. When we settle into the theater of autobiography, what we are ready to believe—and what most autobiographers<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Francis-Noël<br>
  Abstract: In an age of authorless, contextless, deconstructed texts, Francis-NoÃ«l Thomas argues that it is time to re-examine a fundamental but neglected concept of literature: writing is an action whose agent is an individual. Addressing both general readers and scholars, Thomas offers two cases, Bernard Shaw's
         Saint Joanand Marcel Proust'sA la recherche du temps perdu, read against the background of the authors' large, eccentric, and surprisingly similar claims about their texts as acts. He examines what happens when we take these claims seriously enough to find out why the authors made them in the first place and what bearing they have on the texts themselves.<br>

  Abstract: A
                  la recherche du temps perduis so unconventional that there is no danger of mistaking it for an “ordinary” novel. The demands it makes of its readers are so great that Proust is almost obliged to promise more than the ordinary aesthetic pleasures of fiction as a condition for finding readers at all. He does promise more and has apparently fulfilled his promise. Early critics who accused his book of being formless, chaotic, and self-indulgent have long since given way to those who see it as a distinguished and serious work, not only a great work of fiction but<br>

The haunting question that arises for the critic and the historian as well as for the theoretician of literature and those who study the anthropological, psychological, and sociological aspects of imagination is that of the resilience of myths. How is it that these ancient narratives – very often Greek myths in the case of the literatures of the West – survive and revive with ever-renewed meaning for writers, readers, and spectators of subsequent periods?

Thomson draws the reader into the largely uninhabited space between philosophy and literature, providing new critical strategies that allow text and reader to respond to the very distance they share. These strategies involve a reconceptualization of distance that recognizes the productive and affirmative nature of separation.<br>

  Abstract: At the heart of Bronwen Wallace’s poetics is a profound sense of the way our lives take shape in narrative relation to other people’s stories and their reciprocal responses to ours. As a result, she developed a poetic voice that was immediate, down-to-earth, and always caught in the act of offering up a good story. Her distinctive gesture is the direct address of the talking lyric, calling a community of readers into narrative filiation and response-ability. Significantly, she attributes her talking lyric to forms that, for her, constitute female popular knowledge and culture – gossip and storytelling.¹ In a number of<br>

However, it is description that I want to discuss, first briefly in this introduction and then at considerable length over the course of what follows. As it is generally used in regard to contemporary poetry, the word “descriptive” is drab at best and more often derogatory. Applied casually to Bishop, it expresses something that<br>

  Book Title: Knight-Monks of Vichy France-Uriage, 1940-1945<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): HELLMAN JOHN<br>
  Abstract: In The Knight-Monks of Vichy France John Hellman describes the founding, operation, transformation, and demise of the school, details the institution's ideological and political struggles with other segments of French society, and deals with the remarkable rise of Uriage ideas and alumni in postwar France. By focusing on the social, philosophical, and psychological concepts propounded by the staff of the school, Hellman has produced the first study that shows the École Nationale des Cadres d'Uriage to have been an original educational and group experience which inspired French youth from very different backgrounds to abandon the liberal democratic tradition for a new political and social vision. Drawing on a variety of sources, including interviews, newly available archival material, Vichy publications, correspondence, and diary entries, Hellman contributes to the current, lively debate concerning the phenomenon of collaboration and the response of the French population to fascism and to the occupation during the Second World War. This book will be of particular interest to readers concerned with the intellectual and political life of modern France, modern religious thought and experience, fascism and the Vichy regime, changes in France in the prewar and postwar periods, and the "third way" political option in contemporary Europe.<br>

  Author(s) TUHKUNEN TAÏNA<br>
  Abstract: Among the attempts to give shape to a republic, a state in which supreme power is held by the people and not by a pre-eminent ruler, Carol Shields’s novel
                  The Republic of Loveis undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary essays at voicing one’s wish to live in peaceful, yet not necessarily placid, coexistence with one’s fellow creatures, even in our bleak and boastful modern times. Both a serious meditation on love and a playful, novelistic exposé of one of the least beloved subjects of artistic expression – that of an ordinary happy life – Shields’s novel leaves the reader<br>

  10  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80wsr">Aphorism in the Francophone Novel of the Twentieth Century</a><br>
  Abstract: Aphorism, while constituting a literary genre
                  per se,can function concomitantly with a different genre — for example, the novel. Aphorisms deployed along with another genre serve both as a component of the overall text and as text in and of themselves. Given their differentiated identity, aphorisms display idiosyncratic powers of evocation peculiar to the genre. Because of its peculiar behaviour in relation to the narrated chain of events, aphorism often demands the reader’s focused attention. Once a reader becomes conscious of their rhetorical and semantic content, a novel’s aphorisms might do little more than support a traditional reading of the<br>

                  Disgracerefuses to foreground its complex and at times bafflingly oblique relation to its own historicity, leaving readers with the task of reading the text into its context, its contemplation of the possibility of forgiveness constitutes a complex engagement with the political realities of the post-apartheid era.

  Abstract: In a brief study of melancholia and depression (recently expanded into a book,
                  Black Sun) Julia Kristeva posits a general theory of the usefulness of literature, and states that literary representation is a “staging of affects” which “possesses a real and imaginary efficacy that, cathartic more than of the order of elaboration, is a therapeutic method utilized in all societies through the ages.”¹ Though this statement as a generalization about all literature might make the reader sceptical, it may be accurately applied to the specific genre of elegy: elegyisa verbal presentation or staging of emotion, wherein the detached<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 2 I argued that Gallant figures the elegiac in her fiction in a variety of ways, including the use of plot as trope, experimentation with contrasting points of view, and the subversion of sequential chronology. The work of mourning is demonstrated in Gallant’s stories to be a form of “narrative thinking,” which, according to John Robinson and Linda Hawpe, “consists of creating a fit between a situation and the story schema. Establishing a fit, that is, making a story out of experience, is a heuristic process,” they continue, “one which requires skill, judgment, and experience.”¹ The reader, too,<br>

  5  Munrovian Melancholy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt818sp">Figuring Grief</a><br>
  Abstract: I have been arguing that Munro’s fiction, with its emphasis on loss and on the importance of story-telling as a method of gaining knowledge of the past, reveals and enacts a poetics of elegy. Munro, like Gallant, insists that the past must be evaluated and re-evaluated and that memory — though not equivalent to truth — is the most important source of knowledge, of a necessarily fictional truth. Gallant’s characters often learn very little of the lessons she urges her readers to learn; we acquire insights about memory, history, truth, and writing by interpreting the ironic narrative stance employed in her fiction.<br>

  Book Title: Augustine's Theology of Preaching-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): SANLON PETER T.<br>
  Abstract: Scholarship has painted many pictures of Augustine—the philosophical theologian, the refuter of heresy, or contributor to doctrines like Original Sin—but the picture of Augustine as preacher, says Sanlon, has been seriously neglected. When academics marginalize the Sermones ad Populum, the real Augustine is not presented accurately. In this study, Sanlon does more, however, than rehabilitate a neglected view of Augustine. How do the theological convictions that Augustine brought to his preaching challenge, sustain, or shape our work today? By presenting Augustine’s thought on preaching to contemporary readers Sanlon contributes a major new piece to the ongoing reconsideration of preaching in the modern day, a consideration that is relevant to all branches of the twenty-first century church.<br>

  Book Title: By Bread Alone-The Bible through the Eyes of the Hungry<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Pilarski Ahida Calderón<br>
  Abstract: Important ecclesiastical documents have stressed the urgency of world hunger and put in the foreground its natural and historical causes, from famine to global austerity measures and welfare. These concerns have not always affected the way the biblical texts themselves have been read, however. Here, inspired by calls, from Dorothee Sölle and Kathleen O Connor, biblical scholars apply a "hermeneutics of hunger" to the Bible, taking readings of texts from the Old and New Testaments alike on the premise that human hunger and want are urgent concerns that rightly shape the work of interpretation. Too often, however, as the authors show, biblical texts—like Jesus' well-known words that humans do not live "by bread alone"—have been used to marginalize such concerns within religious communities. Their essays here explore the dynamics of hunger and its causation in ancient Israel and the Greco-Roman world and challenge readers to take seriously the centrality of hunger concerns in the Bible.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Reading is one of the basic skills a student needs. But reading is not just an activity of the eyes and the brain. Reading Theologically, edited by Eric D. Barreto, brings together eight seminary educators from a variety of backgrounds to explore what it means to be a reader in a seminary context--to read theologically. Reading theologically involves a specific minset adn posture towards texts and ideas, people and communities alike. Reading theologically is not just about academic skill building but about the formation of a ministerial leader who can engage scholarship critically, interpret Scripture and tradition faithfully, welcome different perspectives, and help lead others to do the same. This brief, readable, edited volume emphasizes the vital skills, habits, practices, and values involved in reading theologically. Reading Theologically is a vital resource for students beginning the seminary process and professors of introductory level seminary courses.<br>

  Abstract: The simple, vivid story of the
                  Unjust Stewardin Luke 16:1-9 is generally, albeit surprisingly, assessed as “the most difficult of the parables.”¹ Its original meaning is either considered to be completely lost,² so that Luke too was perplexed,³ or the parable is thought to convey a complex message that is hard to perceive at first reading. The reason for the bafflement is obvious: by presenting his hearers with a deceitful man as a role model Jesus appears to commend immoral behavior. For most religious and academic readers this is unacceptable. Moreover, it is difficult to combine the unethical parable<br>

  Book Title: The Future of the Word-An Eschatology of Reading<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

  Abstract: The Joseph of the book of Genesis is both a dreamer and dream-reader, and even the briefest page-through of his tale suggests that the latter is more useful—certainly more lucrative—than the former. In his early life, Joseph dreams two big dreams, the grasping subconscious desire of which is obvious—and offensive—to all those around him: one night, he dreams that his brothers’ sheaves of wheat bow down to his sheaf, and another night, he dreams that the sun, moon, and eleven stars bow down to him.

  Abstract: In the gospel accounts, John the Baptist’s ministry rides the line between the necessity and difficulty of judgment. He is a baptizer known for unflinching denunciations and unhesitating warnings (Matt. 3:7). Yet when confronted with Jesus’ request for baptism, John almost refuses to perform it, because he knows of his own need for forgiveness. That double bind, between the rock of inevitable, necessary judgment and the hard place of our incapacity for just execution, is where we too are left in the wilderness as readers for the future of the word. When we encounter texts and read, even as would-be<br>

  Book Title: Antiochene Theoria in the Writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret of Cyrus-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Perhai Richard J.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical scholars have often contrasted the exegesis of the early church fathers from the eastern region and “school” of Syrian Antioch against that of the school of Alexandria. The Antiochenes have often been described as strictly historical-literal exegetes in contrast to the allegorical exegesis of the Alexandrians. Patristic scholars now challenge those stereotypes, some even arguing that few differences existed between the two groups. This work agrees that both schools were concerned with a literal and spiritual reading. But, it also tries to show, through analysis of Theodore and Theodoret’s exegesis and use of the term theoria, that how they integrated the literal-theological readings often remained quite distinct from the Alexandrians. For the Antiochenes, the term theoria did not mean allegory, but instead stood for a range of perceptions—prophetic, christological, and contemporary. It is in these insights that we find the deep wisdom to help modern readers interpret Scripture theologically.<br>

One is to help correct the misperceptions of some who affirm what they believe to be an Antiochene<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 2, the terms

I concluded that both of these Antiochenes understoodtheōriaandtheōreōin their hermeneutical aspects as the contemplative interpretive process enabled by the Holy Spirit and applicable for OT prophets, NT apostles, and postcanonical contemporaries who have faith to see. The secondary literature reviewed in chapter 3 supports this, describing Antiochenetheōriaas a process by which these two bishops linked OT passages to Christ in the NT and made application to their readers.<br>

  Book Title: Stardom in Postwar France-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Holmes Diana<br>
  Abstract: The 1950s and 1960s were a key moment in the development of postwar France. The period was one of rapid change, derived from post-World War II economic and social modernization; yet many traditional characteristics were retained. By analyzing the eruption of the new postwar world in the context of a France that was both modern and traditional, we can see how these worlds met and interacted, and how they set the scene for the turbulent 1960s and 70s. The examination of the development of mass culture in post-war France, undertaken in this volume, offers a valuable insight into the shifts that took place. By exploring stardom from the domain of cinema and other fields, represented here by famous figures such as Brigitte Bardot, Johnny Hallyday or Jean-Luc Godard, and less conventionally treated areas of enquiry (politics [de Gaulle], literary [Francoise Sagan], and intellectual culture [Levi-Strauss]) the reader is provided with a broad understanding of the mechanisms of popularity and success, and their cultural, social, and political roles. The picture that emerges shows that many cultural articulations remained or became identifiably "French," in spite of the American mass-culture origins of these social, economic, and cultural transformations.<br>

  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

  Book Title: Negotiating Justice-Progressive Lawyering, Low-Income Clients, and the Quest for Social Change<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Shdaimah Corey S.<br>
  Abstract: While many young people become lawyers for the big bucks, others are motivated by the pursuit of social justice, seeking to help people for whom legal services are financially, socially, or politically inaccessible. These progressive lawyers often bring a considerable degree of idealism to their work, and many leave the field due to insurmountable red tape and spiraling disillusionment. But what about those who stay? And what do their clients think? Negotiating Justice explores how progressive lawyers and their clients negotiate the dissonance between personal idealism and the realities of a system that doesn't often champion the rights of the poor.Corey S. Shdaimah draws on over fifty interviews with urban legal service lawyers and their clients to provide readers with a compelling behind-the-scenes look at how different notions of practice can present significant barriers for both clients and lawyers working with limited resources, often within a legal system that many view as fundamentally unequal or hostile. Through consideration of the central themes of progressive lawyering - autonomy, collaboration, transformation, and social change - Shdaimah presents a subtle and complex tableau of the concessions both lawyers and clients often have to make as they navigate the murky and resistant terrains of the legal system and their wider pursuits of justice and power.<br>

Earlier meanings include “[t]he action of hearing” (dating from c. 1374) and a “[f]ormal hearing,” often with royalty or with a judge (from 1377 ).

One use belongs to literary criticism, as the critic and reader observe the people in a story or novel as “characters,” that is, as agents or actors (Burke 1973 ) whose actions move a story through time. The other use refers to the moral qualities of a person. These uses of “character” are related, as the root of the English word lies in a Greek word for a tool used to mark or engrave a material (

Their work has been foundational for readers who want not so much to deny as to move beyond historical and philological approaches that obscure biblical literature’s religious and humanistic vitality. Buber and Rosenzweig bring God back into the picture and thus represent a gesture of return to older modes of biblical interpretation. Still, their approach does not simply restore medieval or midrashic approaches to<br>

  Abstract: The real title of this book is not “The Disarticulate”; it is “The Dys-/Disarticulate.” My excellent and sensible editor at New York University Press, Eric Zinner, and series editor Michael Bérubé both advised me to keep it simple, lose the slash, and pick one title so as to avoid confusion. Let me now—now that my reader has picked up the book, opened it, and started to read—reintroduce the slash, the double title, the stutter, the confusion.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qh1w6">Communities in Dispute</a><br>
  Abstract: Having addressed the literary composition and historical-situation features of the Johannine Epistles, their theological and ethical content becomes more readily accessible and understandable. In addition to an adequate understanding of their composition and context helping the reader get the content right, however, misconstruing such features may impede one’s adequate understanding of their message, so a good deal of modesty is required in any approach to the Johannine Epistles, as one must remind oneself that evidence can sometimes be seen as pointing in more than one direction.<br>

  Latino/a Biblical Interpretation: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qh241">Latino/a Biblical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Author(s) Lozada Francisco<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays on the question of what makes Latino/a biblical interpretation “Latino/a” raises a central and intriguing issue for critics and readers alike: Is identity a matter of being and/or practice? Is the “Latino/a-ness” of an interpretation defined by the personal identity (howsoever defined) of the interpreter? Or is it a matter of how Latino/a biblical interpretation is practiced—that is, are there certain principles, sources, methods (reading strategies), or aims that make some biblical interpretations Latino/a and others not? In this concluding reflection it is not my intention to define Latino/a biblical interpretation in a rigid way,<br>

  Abstract: SOCIAL SCIENTISTS succeeded in laying out the variables conditioning the structure of Colombian society, focusing on land and land-tenure patterns and highlighting the concept of the agrarian frontier to underscore the chaotic nature of the social and point to the inchoate form of the political. Invoking Fabio López de la Roche’s argument that the fundamentalist Christian view serves as the umbrella or atmosphere to this historical moment provides a brief but significant comment on the cultural parameters subtending this mode-of-production model.

  Abstract: This is the issue with which Emyr Humphreys wrestles both in his sequence of novels and in the independent novels written concurrently. Using very different techniques, Humphreys is concerned, no less in the independent novels than in his ‘The Land of the Living’ sequence, both to express the importance of its history to Welsh society and to instruct his reader about that history.

He has been at the heart of French literary publishing with twenty-five years working for Gallimard, from professional reader to

  Abstract: ‘Let’s Make Things Better.’ So announced Philips, the transnational electronics giant, in a new global ad campaign launched in September 1995. The company explained how the theme and slogan were a far better representation of its purposes than the more obvious brag, ‘We make better things.’¹ In fact, the statement was pathetic: bland, vague, and hackneyed. No wonder it fostered an initial flurry of boring ads which featured a smiling employee saying trite things to magazine readers. More interesting than Philips’s lack of inspiration was its commitment of time and funds to this kind of image campaign. Here it followed<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442693951">Magical Imaginations</a><br>
  Abstract: In his
                  Defense of Poesy, Sir Philip Sidney claims that the ‘charming force’ of poetry can lead even ‘hard-hearted evil men’ who enjoy only ‘indulgere genio’ to ‘see the form of goodness (which seen they cannot but love) ere themselves be aware.’Magical Imaginationswas conceived when I became interested in this claim, particularly in the way it afforded literary pleasure ideological efficacy, as if poetic delight could make resistant readers love ‘goodness’ without alerting them that their dispositions were being disciplined. This intriguing and perhaps disquieting suggestion made me newly curious about Edmund Spenser’s statement that his 1590Faerie<br>

  Abstract: In a moment that exemplifies his charming critical persona, Sir Philip Sidney ends his 1581 essay of literary theory,

  Author(s) SHELL ALISON<br>
  Abstract: ‘A palinode [is] … used of those who change their minds for the better.’¹ This definition, from the
                  Proverbsof Macarius, would have sounded familiar to writers in late-sixteenth-century England who explored the themes of repentance, recantation, and conversion. But in cases where these writings mirror or comment upon real-life denominational shifts, readers would have disagreed over whether a change was for the better. This essay explores the early career of the late Elizabethan writer William Alabaster, who underwent religious conversion at least twice, once to Catholicism and once from it, and a spate of sonnet-writing – and probably at least<br>

  Author(s) KUCHAR GARY<br>
  Abstract: Although
                  Saint Peters Complaintis one of Robert Southwell’s most well-known and widely discussed poems, in one sense it represents uncharted territory: readers have not yet observed that it unfolds as a sustained alchemical allegory. ‘The burning Babe’ is generally recognized as presenting the conceptually simple, if poetically effective, alchemical conceit that Jesus is the alembic-furnace orfornax tribulationisin which penitent hearts undergo purification, but the numerous and surprisingly involved alchemical allusions structuringSaint Peters Complainthave not received comparable attention.¹ The basic conceit of the poem is that Peter is transmuted by Christ’s grace in a way that<br>

  Abstract: As new critical perspectives unfold, today’s reader can better grasp how the publication and reception of
                  Rerum vulgarium fragmentahas varied over the centuries, revealing the literary biases of different eras. Starting with Velutello’sIl Petrarca(1525), the original structure and sequence of theFragmentawas lost sight of as the work was cut apart and rearranged. Though later editions included all 366 poems in the proper order, the convention of beginning Part 2 at poem 267 and titling the parts “in vita” and “in morte” persisted.

  Abstract: Although
                  La Chuteis narrated in the first person, the ‘I’ of the narrative voice is by no means the only ‘forme vide’ or empty slot that the text provides for the reader. Even the most cursory reading of this novel or ‘récit’ reveals the presence of a silent interlocutor, a paradoxical phenomenon made possible only because the words of Clamence’s companion are never reported directly by him. Clamence describes the person with whom he is conversing in terms that are general enough to have a general applicability and yet concrete enough to turn a shadow into a presence: he<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters, I have spoken of the way the Camusian text functions within itself, produces its own reflection, as well as the way it reproduces within itself its relationship to its reader. It remains to consider the manner in which the different texts relate to one another, for here too a mirroring effect can be seen to be at work. The intertextuality¹ in question is of a very special kind since no texts by other writers are concerned. In fact, if one were to consider the whole of Camus’ works as one single text, then one could more<br>

  Author(s) O’Neill Michael<br>
  Abstract: In her dealings with form, Kathleen Jamie is on her guard against anything that smacks of prepackaged comfort. Forms seem often to be calculatedly under stress, at an angle to anything conventional, as in the fine sonnet ‘The Cupboard’ from
                  The Tree House(44). In this poem, short lines and an emphatic but unpredictable use of rhyme and off-rhyme keep the poem and reader on their toes, following the twists and turns of a poem that feels its way forward. The ‘cupboard’ is less symbol than wryly presented surrogate for symbolic meaning. Jamie adeptly obeys and departs from the organising<br>

  Abstract: At the end of her poem ‘The Cave of the Fish’, Kathleen Jamie writes, ‘Today I sit at the cave’s / cool mouth, halfway / through my life’ (
                  TH11). This tercet recalls the famous opening line of Dante’sCommedia: ‘In the middle of the journey of our life / I found myself . . .’. It must be partly because of Dante’s cultural legacy that this narrative pattern seems so familiar, even to twenty-first-century secular readers: the pattern of a life shaped into two halves, hinged by a critical turning point.¹ For Dante’s pilgrim, the midlife turn leads to<br>

  Book Title: Forgetting Differences-Tragedy, Historiography, and the French Wars of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frisch Andrea<br>
  Abstract: This study argues that the political and legislative process of forgetting internal differences, undertaken in France after the civil wars of the sixteenth century, leads to subtle yet fundamental shifts in the broader conception of the relationship between readers or spectators on the one hand, and the matter of history, on the other. These shifts, occasioned by the desire for communal reconciliation and generally associated with an increasingly modern sensibility, will nonetheless prove useful to the ideologies of cultural and political absolutism.<br>

The paratexts and programmatic statements I have highlighted afford insight into the ways in which elite writers forged the rhetorical tools with which they and their readers could reconcile themselves to their troubling recent past, and thus to one another.<br>

  Abstract: Mansfield’s relationship with France is expressed in many different ways in her short stories, one of which is the fundamental role played by the French language. Mansfield confronts English-speaking readers with a foreign language that constantly interacts with their mother tongue, creating an intriguing tension between the two languages, both of which are unsettled as a result, and lose their familiarity. This tension puzzles native speakers, whether French or English, albeit through different processes; the title of one of her most famous stories, ‘Je ne parle pas français’, through its very paradoxical nature, epitomises the issue of the interaction between<br>

It is easy to think, on the one hand, that Meillassoux’s arguments are all spectacular, unheard-of and revolutionary, or to assume, on the other hand, that he is playing a game with his reader, and cannot possibly mean what he says in earnest. Neither of these readings is true or fair, and Meillassoux’s approach<br>

  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s 2013 poem, “On the Gift of a Fountain Pen,” provides an appropriate starting point for this critical introduction to his work since it encapsulates his central concern—the role of the writer. In pondering his vocation, Heaney has always worried about his obligation to others—not just readers, but also to the general public—and this poem vocalizes that worry ably. Moreover, he seems also to fear a drying-up of inspiration here. Drawing on John Keats’s “When I Have Fears that I May Cease to Be,” he opens by musing, “Now that your pen is in my hand<br>

  Abstract: The term ‘Frankfurt School’ refers to the work of members of the

  Book Title: The Agamben Dictionary-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Whyte Jessica<br>
  Abstract: Agamben's vocabulary is both expansive and idiosyncratic, with words such as 'infancy', 'gesture' and 'profanation' given specific and complex meanings that can bewilder the new reader. Bringing together leading scholars in the field, including Steven DeCaroli (Goucher College, Baltimore), Justin Clemens (University of Melbourne), Claire Colebrook (Penn State) and Steven DeCaroli (Goucher College, Baltimore) the 150 entries explain the key concepts in Agamben's work and his relationship with other thinkers, from Aristotle to Aby Warburg.<br>

  Book Title: Poetic Language-Theory and Practice from the Renaissance to the Present<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Tom<br>
  Abstract: The discussions provide a jargon-free account of a wide range of historical and contemporary schools of thought about poetic language, and an organised, coherent critique of those schools (including analytical philosophy, cognitive poetics, structuralism and post-structuralism). Via close readings of whole poems from 1600 to the present readers are taken through a wide range of modernist, experimental and innovative poetries. Paired chapters within a chronological structure allow lecturers and students to approach the material in a variety of ways (by individual chapters, paired historical periods) that are appropriate to different courses.<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: The argument of this book is that poems encourage their readers to experience language as a dual-aspect phenomenon, as something known and understood in two different ways simultaneously. Poems make the language in which they are made appear contingent, and necessary, at once: they make their writers and readers feel a justness or truth in the poem’s language, at the same time as making those writers and readers question just how that part of the poem’s language (a rhyme, an image, the weight on a syllable, and so on) could produce the reactions it produces. The language in poems seems<br>

  Abstract: Why bother with deconstruction? Why read deconstructive writings? Why read texts deconstructively? Why should deconstruction be necessary, or even important? What demand is being made by deconstruction? These are questions which haunt the critical reader who has followed the work of Jacques Derrida. They are questions voiced by the reader who, in pleasure and patience, has read Derrida’s work, but who now, perhaps impatiently, wants to question the demand that is placed on him or her by that work. They are questions, I shall claim, that demand an ethical response, that call deconstructive reading to responsibility, to be responsible. The<br>

  Abstract: ‘Bois’ – ‘drink’; understood verbally, Derrida’s final word articulates an imperative, it places the reader under obligation. It is an imperative written without a point of exclamation in the intimacy of the second person singular. It is not directed from a position of height to an anonymous multitude; it is not the impersonal ‘Buvons!’ or ‘Buvez!’, which, in a spirit of exclamation and camaraderie, commands others to join in a toast or partake in a symposium.

  Author(s) Ritchie Fiona<br>
  Abstract: In 1679 John Dryden wrote of the challenges he found in adapting Shakespeare in terms that might surprise a modern reader. In remodelling 
                  Troilus and Cressida, Dryden said he “undertook to remove that heap of Rubbish, under which many excellent thoughts lay wholly bury’d”. Similarly, in 1681 Nahum Tate described Shakespeare’s King Lear as “a Heap of Jewels, unstrung and unpolisht; yet . . . dazling in their Disorder” (Clark, 1997, 295). The Restoration theatre did not have the same reverence towards Shakespeare’s works that we do today; indeed, perhaps the most surprising aspect of the performance of Shakespeare on<br>

  Abstract: There are no teenagers in the seven ages of man. Jaques, in describing the development of a human being in

Although to a modern reader or audience member, this description may sound like a lovesick teenager, to Shakespeare’s audience it describes someone older.

  Abstract: In this chapter I want to consider the import of a political speech in the context of the relation between the ethical and the political, the spiritual and the material. To do this I want to play off the historical moment and its surrounding contextual discourses with the speech’s invocation of a transhistorical and universal set of values. New Historicism evolved in the 1980s as in some ways a reaction to structuralism and formalism. Indebted to political, poststructuralist and reader-response theory, it has focused on the intertextuality of literary and non-literary texts and the presence of diverse culturally specific discourses<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 3, I noted John Fiske’s view that the difference between literary and popular texts lies in the latter’s reliance on its contemporary social relevance for its popularity and significance. For Fiske, popular texts are evaluated according to their social values, not their universal or aesthetic ones. This may be true in literature departments in many cases, but it is not necessarily true in the context of wider cultural discussion. In this chapter, I will therefore look at a popular novel in the context of debates over questions of good and evil. These are concerned with readers’ ethical ideals,<br>

  Abstract: Media can represent lions or hunters. However, powerful media and cultural institutions whose business it is to record, archive and make accessible the everyday life, major events and social and cultural heritage of nations and communities, invariably write those narratives in ways that glorify not only themselves but the cultural hegemony of the societies they serve. They need to keep their customers, readers, audiences and users happy. They control their own archives even if they are actually only the custodians and not the full rightful owners of a nation’s heritage. This is the case with the publicly funded broadcaster in<br>

  Author(s) Panagia Davide<br>
  Abstract: The reader will notice that Gilles Deleuze barely makes an appearance in what follows. This essay is, for all intents and purposes, an essay about David Hume. Yet, this is an admittedly odd reading of Hume; a reading that refuses to engage him on epistemological terms but is, rather, committed to reading Hume as a ‘minor’ literary figure. Of course, Deleuze wrote a book on Hume and his insights on Hume’s theories of sensation pepper the gamut of his philosophic

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall-Randell Sarah<br>
  Abstract: In romances-Renaissance England's version of the fantasy novel-characters often discover books that turn out to be magical or prophetic, and to offer insights into their readers' selves.
      The Immaterial Bookexamines scenes of reading in important romance texts across genres: Spenser'sFaerie Queene,Shakespeare'sCymbelineandThe Tempest,Wroth'sUrania,and Cervantes'Don Quixote. It offers a response to "material book studies" by calling for a new focus on imaginary or "immaterial" books and argues that early modern romance authors, rather than replicating contemporary reading practices within their texts, are reviving ancient and medieval ideas of the book as a conceptual framework, which they use to investigate urgent, new ideas about the self and the self-conscious mind.<br>

  Abstract: Early modern romance is a Janus-faced genre. It looks nostalgically backward, to the medieval past and the tales that accrete around English and Continental chivalric heroes: Arthur, Amadis, Guy, Bevis, Roland. At the same time, it pushes the leading edge in generic experimentation, engendering radically new forms, hybrid species such as tragicomic drama, and developing the mode that would ultimately dominate fiction making, the long prose narrative, which became the novel. Evidence that early seventeenth-century English readers themselves regarded romance as participating in such a duality of past and present, traditionalism and modernity, is present in the language of early<br>

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Abstract: The above account appeared in a Parisian daily newspaper,
                  Le Matin, in 1906 among a list offaits-divers, sundry incidents too minor to warrant full stories. Offering only a bare description of the scene and without preface or commentary, the miniature narrative says little about the victim yet speaks volumes. nestled among other reports of accident or misfortune from across France, the anonymous story reminds the newspaper reader of shared vulnerability: even a priest is not safe from the capriciousness of fate.

  Abstract: In engaging the tension between perspectives that challenge traditional gender stereotypes and those that reiterate normative conventions, feminist readers encounter a set of more nuanced methodological and theoretical considerations. At the outset, it is imperative to situate Ibn ʿArabī’s teachings on gender within the assumptions of his worldview—that is, to take seriously the Sufi framework of his engagement with gender. As is characteristic of all Ibn ʿArabī’s works, paradox, ambivalence, and contradiction are part of his mystical methodology. Since reality “as it really is” or mystical experiences give a glimpse into that which cannot be understood or captured in<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the ways in which Ibn ʿArabī’s propels the reader into a different realm of imagining gender by presenting powerful antinomian images of the feminine, sexuality, and women. I begin by examining his depictions of the divine feminine and his related claim that God is most perfectly witnessed in women. His argument is peppered by constant invocations and references to the deep existential intimacy between man and woman as reflected in the primordial myth of Adam and Eve’s creation. This leads us to examine Ibn ʿArabī’s ideas on sex and sexual intimacy between men and women and how<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M.

She holds a heart in her right hand, and another heart is safety-pinned to her left bosom. She leans backward, her left wrist flexed coquettishly.

Seventeenthcentury England was a cauldron of conflicting beliefs, many of which owed their origins to religious concerns that today’s readers will find difficult to assimilate. In addition, although at least a few women—such as Mary Astell—seemed to be able to rise from comparatively impoverished backgrounds to a life of gentility, the class distinctions in English life are so marked during this time period that we may experience a failure of imagination in<br>

  Abstract: From Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke, to Jürgen Habermas, social theorists have long argued that political transformations rest on a foundation of reasoned public critiques. Habermas contended that widespread public debate about—and criticism of—official government policies first developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through a process of rational disputation conducted via the press. For Habermas, emotion had no part to play in this idealized political process. Instead, he applauded “the critical judgment of the public making use of its reason.” From his contemporary eighteenth-century vantage point, Bolingbroke too saw little efficacy in emotion.

The language is often overwrought, it addresses the reader as if he or she were an interactor, and it exaggerates or omits many details about the game in question.

  Abstract: In

This theory runs through a vast panorama of universal history, which is painted in the book’s central chapter in a quaintly archaic style that could make the anthropological reader wince. Not only does it employ the venerable savagery-barbarism-civilization triad, but the proliferating ethnographic references are treated in a seemingly<br>

  Author(s) Flaxman Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Poet and critic, sometimes surrealist and sublime schizophrenic, Antonin Artaud has been the subject of vastly greater posthumous interest than he ever enjoyed during his relatively short life. His fame derives primarily from his poetry, plays, letters, and essays—above all, from the revolutionary Theater of Cruelty he developed “to restore a passionate and convulsive conception of life” to the stage.³ Still, his writings acquired a significant readership only after he died, alone in a psychiatric clinic, in 1948.⁴ Thus, Artaud was as much discovered as rediscovered in the subsequent decades, when the initial publication of the

Through the transports of environmentally inclined verbs familiar and unexpected, this collaborative project aims not to provide encyclopedic overviews or definitive accounts of critical concepts (allconcepts are critical) but to forge a welcoming and heterogeneous fellowship, a colloquy for pondering possibilities for environmental thinking, ecological theory, and engaged humanities practice during a time of widespread crisis.

  Abstract: We start with what is immediately at hand, what we see and touch, what supports and sustains us. In societies where capitalism “prevails,” Karl Marx writes, “wealth” (
                  Reichtum) “appears” as a prodigious heap of commodities, “eine ‘ungeheure Warensammlung.’”¹ Marx beginsCapitalby reminding his readers of the historical distinctiveness of such a society, in which the existential richness of life comes to be measured in the profuse variety of goods available for purchase. Folklore describes theUngeheureas an immense man-eating ogre. The joke, of course, is that human beings—what Marx calls living-labor, “the expenditure of human brain, nerves,<br>

I thought the divagations through the forest of other people’s ideas would eventually bring me to a place where these different testimonies met. The mythological stories would at last yield a common pattern or motivation. Writing the book would be an act of seducing the readers, but I would remain in control: the shape of the outcome would be veiled—the labyrinth we have had to pass through, the burden of being heir to millennia of interpretation, was a kind of initiation, a Dantean reminder that<br>

  Abstract: Featuring established and emerging scholars from varying disciplines, this volume presents a collaborative imagining of what a more-than-green ecology offers. While highlighting critical approaches not yet common within ecotheory, the contributions remain diverse and cover a range of topics including materiality, the inhuman, and the agency of objects. By way of color, Cohen guides readers through a reflection of an essentially complex and disordered universe and demonstrates the spectrum as an unfinishable totality, always in excess of what a human perceives.<br>

To simplify the task of reading this work, I will set the scene with the help of a few maps.

  Abstract: The ten essayists in this book consider the “Yale critics”—Harold Bloom, Geoffrey Hartman, Paul de Man, and J. Hillis Miller—in the context of American criticism and the critical tradition. The editors note in the preface that “The largest context that continually concerns us is that of the gap between Anglo-American and Continental criticism, resulting from a difference in social experience. … By selecting contributors who, in different ways, find themselves between these two traditions, we hope that we have made our volume interesting and accessible to the American reader.”<br>

  Abstract: One difficulty even for sympathetic readers of the Yale critics is simply a difference of bibliography. The main reference point for American academics is New Criticism, which long ago triumphed both over historical scholarship and over doctrinally based political and social commentary. Protest over the war in Vietnam stirred recollections of these earlier debates about the historical context and social function of both literature and criticism, but masked the simultaneous and more enduring infusion of European theory into American criticism.

One of the most distinctive features of his writing is the creation of a situation in which a presumed truth has been concealed with a mask. Consequently, in Denevi’s work there always seems to be an uneasy tension, a nagging suspicion that something is definitely not what it appears to be. As the reader proceeds through the narration, the numerous false facades that hide the unexpected and sometimes shocking truth lying underneath are slowly chipped away. Denevi’s numerous

  Abstract: What is at stake when the ravages of the flesh nourish the ecstasy of the letter? What happens when the metaphorical condensation of love and death, so essential to the mystico-poetic tradition, is realized, actualized, literalized? How do readers and writers situate themselves with respect to texts that communicate sickness, especially when the texts engage the discourse of divinity? Despite their seemingly timeless appeal, these and other questions acquire immediacy and urgency in the crisis of representation (Simon Watney) and the brutality of idealization (Leo Bersani) that mark the age of AIDS.

Beginning with a discussion of the inherent interdisciplinarity of this mode of literary analysis, I concluded by defining what it means to place Morisco scribes and readers, as human agents, at the center of textual study. Rooted in what Gary Saul Morson has termed the “human dimension of time” (1994, 10), the activity-centered approach I am suggesting focuses on the uses to which Morisco readers and scribes putaljamiadotexts within their social world and the ways in which culturally embedded<br>

  Abstract: One of the first things that catches modern readers’ attention when looking at
                  aljamiado-morisconarratives in their manuscript context is that these narratives are frequently part of a large collection of texts bound within the same codex. Analogous in a very general way to modern literary anthologies or course readers used by university professors, the overwhelming majority ofaljamiado-moriscomanuscripts in fact contain a number of texts, many of which are not, strictly speaking, narrative in form. An example of such an anthology is Toledo, BCLM ms. 395, analjamiado-moriscomanuscript copied out near the end of the sixteenth century,<br>

  Abstract: Modern French philosophy would do well to stake a claim to its origins in the

Indeed, something uncanny ties the event of Deleuze′s death at the beginning of November 1995 to the demise that Montaigne imagined for himself in the beginnings of his self-portraiture.

The term “logocentrism” clearly bears a great burden inOf Grammatology. Derrida gives three dimensions of this burden: (1) The phonetization of writing, which has often enough been hailed as a great advance of civilization, “must dissimulate its own history as it is produced” (OG, 11/3), thus bearing the dark side of dissimulation as the condition of its own apparent worth.

  Abstract: We have seen in the Introduction that Derrida’s deconstructive approach to philosophical texts presents the critical reader with what appears to be a dilemma: a critical reading might seem to be committed to the very ideals of truth, rigor, and epistemic accountability deconstructed by the texts that are to be subjected to a critical reading. But this dilemma is simply a reflection of the task that deconstruction sets for itself, namely, that of subjecting itself to what Derrida calls the “classical norms” (
                  OG, 8/lxxxix) even as it deconstructs the metaphysical underpinning of those very norms. Derrida thus insists “that within<br>

  Abstract: Derrida has an undeniable talent for putting—or at least seeming to put—his pen on important and difficult issues, and for doing so in ways that, at least on first reading, seem to be both enlightening and troubling. In addition, there can be no doubt that Derrida can be a penetrating reader: his work on the poetry of Paul Celan in "Shibboleth" (Derrida 1986a) and on Francis Ponge in
                  Signéponge(Derrida 1984c) are ample proof of this. While both of these, and especially the latter, are quite clearly performances in their own right, one rarely has the sense that<br>

  Abstract: Among the authors he admired, Roberto Bolaño reserved a special place for Jorge Luis Borges. “Borges,” he wrote, “is or should be at the center of our canon” (BP 337). Perhaps surprisingly for readers in the English-speaking world, what Bolaño particularly valued was not the conceptual brilliance of the thought experiments that made Borges famous in Europe and North America from the early 1960s on, but the Argentine writer’s humor and courage.

  Abstract: One of the reasons Bolaño’s fiction matters to so many readers is that it is underpinned by a strong, distinctive, and relatively simple sense of what matters in life. His characters live in ethically and politically oriented worlds. This does not go without saying. Since Western literatures began strongly to affirm and defend their autonomy with respect to political and religious institutions in the mid-nineteenth century, many critics and writers have campaigned to purge literature of didacticism, and some have gone further and argued that literature should be ethically and politically neutral. It is worth distinguishing these two objectives, because<br>

            Habermas Handbook, leading Habermas scholars elucidate his thought, providing essential insight into his key concepts, the breadth of his work, and his influence across politics, law, the social sciences, and public life.This volume offers a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis of Habermas's work in its entirety. After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Abstract: Randall Jarrell showed us how to read his contemporaries; we do not yet know how to read him. Often he seems to have understood the writers around him as posterity would: for some poets (such as Robert Lowell and Robert Frost) he helped to shape that posterity, while for others (such as Elizabeth Bishop) he prefigured it. Many readers know Jarrell as the author of several anthology poems (for example, “The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner”), a charming book or two for children, and a panoply of influential reviews.

  Seven  Writing and the Reading Mind from:

  Abstract: In the last chapter, I discussed writing as a means of reenacting speech events such as dialogues and monologues, either for others or for oneself. If for oneself, this performance could be a silent simulation of speech using the reader’s articulatory and auditory imagination. In this concluding chapter I will sketch out some of the unique ways in which writing also began to represent aspects of the mind that only writing could reveal. We have no reason to assume that the new model of the mind that literate culture introduced was the inevitable outcome of evolutionary forces. For Europe, it<br>

  Abstract: There was no debate. There never was a moment when Derrida and Foucault were sitting opposite each other, on display for an audience, arguing back and forth, controlled by a mediator or provoked by a journalist. There can be no images, no transcript. Of course, the history of philosophy is full of debates whose reality and vitality does not depend on an empirical encounter of the sort Foucault had with Chomsky: writers and readers frequently proceed by staging two authors as figures to stake out opposing positions. But the strange quarrel explored in these essays is not quite of that<br>

  Abstract: The vivid and complex imagery of alchemical texts has long interfered with scholars’ ability to understand alchemy and its significance to medieval society. Enigmatic code names such as “green lion,” “sun,” “moon,” and the crucified “Christ” are omnipresent in alchemical literature, even as such texts purport to reveal secret operations to readers. Earlytwentieth-century scholars such as E. O. von Lippmann and Julius Ruska were among the first to study such code names (

  Book Title: The End of Cinema?-A Medium in Crisis in the Digital Age<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BARNARD TIMOTHY<br>
  Abstract: The authors begin with an overview of the extreme positions held by opposing camps in the debate over cinema: the "digitalphobes" who lament the implosion of cinema and the "digitalphiles" who celebrate its new, vital incarnation. Throughout, they remind readers that cinema has never been a static medium but a series of processes and transformations powering a dynamic art. From their perspective, the digital revolution is the eighth major crisis in the history of motion pictures, with more disruptions to come. Brokering a peace among all sides, Gaudreault and Marion emphasize the cultural practice of cinema over rigid claims on its identity, moving toward a common conception of cinema to better understand where it is headed next.<br>

  Abstract: Norman Mailer’s essay “The White Negro” (1957) assaults its readers with existentially tinged racial fantasies of violence and liberation. In the piece, Mailer sought to celebrate a new figure—“the American existentialist,” otherwise referred to as “the hipster.” Pursuing his version of existential man, Mailer followed along a trail that Sartre had already blazed. Mailer intended by his bold embrace of criminal acts and a revolutionary cultural style to trump Sartre. Sartre had talked about the necessity of the novelist entering into a discourse with the era.

  Abstract: The writings of Søren Kierkegaard present a notorious challenge to the reader in search of definitive answers to the questions they pose about despair, anxiety, and other “wounds of Spirit.” While Kierkegaard—under his own name or with his many pseudonyms—hoped to elucidate a Christian remedy to the seemingly intractable problem of modern despair, his reformulation of faith seems somewhat feeble in the face of it. Kierkegaard’s texts simply cannot be measured by the solutions he offers, which are consistently inadequate to the questions he raises.

Here as elsewhere in this essay I blur the distinction between religions insofar as the visionary experience is concerned. Gerard Manley Hopkins, in his “terrible sonnets,” powerfully evoked the dark night of the soul and the unfathomed depths of the mind that, even as he was writing, were being formulated by his scientific contemporaries, especially in Paris, as the “subconscious,” in the more prosaic language of the psychological sciences of their<br>

  Book Title: Reading the-The Literary Aims of a Theravada Buddhist History<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Scheible Kristin<br>
  Abstract: Reading the Mahavamsaadvocates a new, literary approach to this text by revealing its embedded reading advice (to experiencesamvegaandpasada) and affective work of metaphors (the Buddha's dharma as light) and salient characters (nagas). Kristin Scheible argues that theMahavamsarequires a particular kind of reading. In the text's proem, special instructions draw readers to the metaphor of light and thenagas, or salient snake-beings, of the first chapter.Nagasare both model worshippers and unworthy hoarders of Buddha's relics. As nonhuman agents, they challenge political and historicist readings of the text. Scheible sees these slippery characters and the narrative's potent and playful metaphors as techniques for refocusing the reader's attention on the text's emotional aims. Her work explains theMahavamsa's central motivational role in contemporary Sri Lankan Buddhist and nationalist circles. It also speaks broadly to strategies of reading religious texts and to the internal and external cues that give such works lives beyond the page.<br>

TheDīpavaṃsaclearly aims for what I am calling “religious satisfaction” (pasāda)—namely, the feeling of confidence and inclusion in the Buddha’ssāsanathat results from the performed reading by “good people” (sujana).¹ The text suggests that the act of reading or hearing will be transformative for the right reader-hearer; the Dipavamsa’s proem constructs and anticipates a certain expected community of reception and transformation.

  Abstract: From Yü Ying-shih's perspective, the Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on the
      Dao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 1 ofChinese History and Cultureexplores how theDaowas reformulated, expanded, defended, and preserved by Chinese intellectuals up to the seventeenth century, guiding them through history's darkest turns. Essays incorporate the evolving conception of the soul and the afterlife in pre- and post-Buddhist China, the significance of eating practices and social etiquette, the move toward greater individualism, the rise of the Neo-Daoist movement, the spread of Confucian ethics, and the growth of merchant culture and capitalism. A true panorama of Chinese culture's continuities and transition, Yü Ying-shih's two-volume Chinese History and Culture gives readers of all backgrounds a unique education in the meaning of Chinese civilization.<br>

She uses case studies of art and architecture produced in response to government commissions to demonstrate that established visual forms and meanings in Mexican art reflect and inform desires, expectations, memories, and ways of being in the world-in short, that visual culture and cosmopolitanism are fundamental to processes of subjectification and identity.<br>

  Abstract: Jameson supports his thesis by looking closely at the nature of interpretation. Our understanding, he says, is colored by the concepts and categories that we inherit from our culture's interpretive tradition and that we use to comprehend what we read. How then can the literature of other ages be understood by readers from a present that is culturally so different from the past? Marxism lies at the foundation of Jameson's answer, because it conceives of history as a single collective narrative that links past and present; Marxist literary criticism reveals the unity of that uninterrupted narrative.<br>

Readers in the Netherlands and northern Europe continued to regard Luzac’s paper as a dependable source of information about France. But the emergence of an unfettered press in France itself meant that the paper largely lost its relevance for readers there.

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: "
         Paradigms for a Metaphorologymay be read as a kind of beginner's guide to Blumenberg, a programmatic introduction to his vast and multifaceted oeuvre. Its brevity makes it an ideal point of entry for readers daunted by the sheer bulk of Blumenberg's later writings, or distracted by their profusion of historical detail.Paradigmsexpresses many of Blumenberg's key ideas with a directness, concision, and clarity he would rarely match elsewhere. What is more, because it served as a beginner's guide for its author as well, allowing him to undertake an initial survey of problems that would preoccupy him for the remainder of his life, it has the additional advantage that it can offer us a glimpse into what might be called the 'genesis of the Blumenbergian world.'"-from the Afterword by Robert Savage<br>

  Abstract: Having described the infection of eighteenth-century discourses by the trial paradigm and the transformation of the concept of happiness wrought by it, I am also arguing implicitly that these transformations are still with us. Most obviously, we have inherited a constitution from the period that still attests to the suspension of the political hermeneutic of happiness. Moreover, our understanding of happiness is indubitably in large part the one produced by the eighteenth century. But if these effects continue today, the reader may well wonder where the trial narrative itself is to be found. We can still detect vestigial forms of<br>

  Abstract: Although there is a large and growing literature on the differences between oral and written verbalization, many aspects of the differences have not been looked into at all, and many others, although well known, have not been examined in their full implications. Among these latter is the relationship of the socalled “audience” to writing as such, to the situation that inscribed communication establishes and to the roles that readers as readers are consequently called on to play. Some studies in literary history and criticism at times touch near this subject, but none, it appears, take it up in any historical<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to Julian of Norwich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): McAvoy Liz Herbert<br>
  Abstract: Julian of Norwich, the fourteenth/early fifteenth-century anchoress and mystic, is one of the most important and best-known figures of the Middle Ages. Her Revelations, intense visions of the divine, have been widely studied and read; the first known writings of an English woman, their influence extends over theology and literature. However, many aspects of both her life and thought remain enigmatic. This exciting new collection offers a comprehensive, accessible coverage of the key aspects of debate surrounding Julian. It places the author within a wide range of contemporary literary, social, historical and religious contexts, and also provides a wealth of new insights into manuscript traditions, perspectives on her writing and ways of interpreting it, building on the work of many of the most active and influential researchers within Julian studies, and including the fruits of the most recent, ground-breaking findings. It will therefore be a vital companion for all of Julian's readers in the twenty-first century.

  Abstract: Although she wrote from the isolation of an anchoritic cell, Julian aimed at some form of publication, where ‘“publication” is short for public conversation.’¹ In her
                  Revelation² she insists on an audience: the visions are for the good of all her fellow Christians.³ But evidence about the circulation and readership of Julian’s text in the first two centuries of its life is extremely limited and ambiguous.⁴ And the Long Text presents particular difficulties:⁵ although the Short Text is preserved entire in the medieval ‘Amherst’ manuscript, London, British Library, MS Additional 37790, the only manuscript witness to the Long Text which<br>

  Abstract: Many scholars and readers of Julian have puzzled over the strangeness of her text’s structure and the curiously recursive and apparently involuted way that she expounds her showings. Right from the outset, she challenges standard interpretative strategies with her claim in the first chapter of the Long Text that the showing of the Crown of Thorns both ‘comprehended and specified the blessed Trinity’ in which ‘all the shewinges that foloweth be groundide and oned’.² This is typical of her dizzying changes of visual and intellectual perspective: both comprehensive and specific; effortlessly moving from image (crown) to abstraction (Trinity); grounding and<br>

  Book Title: God and the Gawain-Poet-Theology and Genre in Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hatt Cecilia A.<br>
  Abstract: Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are accomplished examples of four different literary genres and represent some of the finest poetry in Middle English. They are, by turns, fast and funny, powerfully dramatic, gentle and ironic, telling of painful bereavement and the terror of victims of disaster and violence, as well as the comic bewilderment of people entangled in alarmingly mysterious situations. The anonymous poet's evident delight in the pleasures and artistry of courtly life has led some readers to suggest that he was a gifted but complacent frequenter of courts, his attention dedicated to the wealthy and his sympathies to the powerful, and moreover, that his poems pay the merest lipservice to religious observance. God and the Gawain-poet argues that, on the contrary, the poet's wide-ranging engagement with all human life explicitly acknowledges all material creation as God's gift, revelling in its physicality, in bodily senses and movement and the ways a community celebrates itself. Dr Hatt shows how, in exhorting readers to recognize and respond to the narrative of divine gift, he appears as an energetic Christian poet and a humane and compassionate observer. Cecilia Hatt gained her D.Phil from Oxford University.<br>

  Abstract: In his 1935 introduction to one of the first annotated editions of
                     La Gatomaquia, Francisco Rodríguez Marín makes the case for the relative obscurity of Lope’s burlesque masterpiece. He rails against ‘los que imaginan ser innecesaria la exégesis en cuanto a las obras de este autor’,¹ proceeding to give examples of Lope’s invented words (‘piramizar’, ‘ñifiñafe’, etc.) and phrases that the uninitiated reader might consider an obstacle to understanding. Despite Burguillos’s claims that ‘la vega es llana’ (147, v. 8),² my analysis of La Gatomaquia will show that the plain surface dissembles much deeper foundations.<br>

  Author(s) Robertson Ritchie<br>
  Abstract: Of all authors writing in German, Kafka is the one whose works have particularly fascinated readers throughout the world. One result is a division between what may be called the lay readers of Kafka and the professional or academic readers. The two groups are divided, in particular, by their attitude to the widespread notion that Kafka’s works must in some sense prophesy the Third Reich and the atrocities of the mid-twentieth century. Writing in the

  Abstract: Kafka is remarkable, above all, for the visual density of his writing, a visual prowess that can be linked to his self-image as an “eye-person” (Augenmensch).¹ His extraordinary literary imagination generates an imagery that startles and challenges the reader who expects the recognizable. Kafka’s intent, it has been said, is “to make strange the familiar.”² Like his much admired model, Gustave Flaubert, he radically changed the fictional worlds that European realism had mapped out.³ The transformative power of his writing, however, unlike Flaubert’s, arises from the stark, suggestive force of his images: the resulting dynamics of puzzlement and shock reveal<br>

  Abstract: In exile in Switzerland, having returned in the last years of his life to working on sections of the novel he had begun decades before, Musil told an inquiring friend that he was not, it was true, moving forward with his work, but that he was, he hoped, moving deeper.¹ This paradoxical deepening is attained by a circular, doubling-back motion that does not move the reader or writer toward a conclusion but rather calls attention to an experience of presence, an aesthetic resistant to progress.

  Abstract: The great success of sentimental fiction during the first half of the sixteenth century indicates that, although these kinds of works may have originally been addressed to an exclusive readership pre-eminently preoccupied with the cultivation of courtly ideals and behaviors, they quickly attracted a much more heterogeneous public. This community was composed not only of noblemen intent on discovering the emblems of a longed-for world which was swiftly waning, but also of a bourgeois audience that found in these texts the elements of a behavioral code that could improve their status. From this perspective, the editorial fortune of the translations<br>

  Abstract: In the first chapter, I studied the various ways in which a narrator produces a magical realist effect in the text. One important point that emerged from the passages being analysed was the centrality of communal belief for adopting a perspective upon reality that is regarded as valid. Disbelievers are frowned upon while storytellers are seen to embellish and exaggerate their accounts on many occasions. The confusion that arises for the reader creates the impression that two points of view upon a given reality are battling with one another. In fact, there are frequent examples within both texts where events<br>

In contrast to ecclesiastic historians and antiquaries who, like Mabillon, worked on charters, registers and capitularies that they did not explicitly designate as medieval,¹ it was to the roman that most other, non-professional or semi-professional readers turned when speaking of this period.

  Book Title: Becoming John Updike-Critical Reception, 1958-2010<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Mazzeno Laurence W.<br>
  Abstract: When John Updike died in 2009, tributes from the literary establishment were immediate and fulsome. However, no one reading reviews of Updike's work in the late 1960s would have predicted that kind of praise for a man who was known then as a brilliant stylist who had nothing to say. What changed? Why? And what is likely to be his legacy? These are the questions that "Becoming John Updike" pursues by examining the journalistic and academic response to his writings. Several things about Updike's career make a reception study appropriate. First, he was prolific: he began publishing fiction and essays in 1956, published his first book in 1958, and from then on, brought out at least one new book each year. Second, his books were reviewed widely - usually in major American newspapers and magazines, and often in foreign ones as well. Third, Updike quickly became a darling of academics; the first book about his work was published in 1967, less than a decade after his own first book. More than three dozen books and hundreds of articles of academic criticism have been devoted to Updike. The present volume will appeal to the continuing interest in Updike's writing among academics and general readers alike. Laurence W. Mazzeno is President Emeritus of Alvernia University. Among other books, he has written volumes on Austen, Dickens, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold for Camden House's Literary Criticism in Perspective series.<br>

  Abstract: In retrospect, the period between 1968 and 1975 might be described as the “breakthrough years” during which Updike became a major novelist, introduced or returned to important recurring characters and themes into his fiction, and continued his exploration of the American scene. Of course, before 1968 Updike was well-known to a select group of readers and critics, many of whom had high regard for his work. While his audience among the general readership was considerable, it did not rival that of contemporary popular giants—writers like Leon Uris, Mary Renault, James Clavell, Irving Wallace, Mary Stewart, and Arthur Hailey.

Common sense alone suggests that in denying a critical need to relate the individual subject (whether author or reader) to a larger cultural, historically specific field of operations, Barthes’ theory of textual construction went too far. But whatever its implicit contradictions (and current memory studies have identified several), there is no denying that the post-structuralist critique of authorship<br>

  Abstract: The concept of redundancy employed in this essay is the one used in mathematics and linguistics to designate symbols that do not add information to a sequence. One of the hazards of teaching twentieth-century war literature is the tacit inference of redundancy by readers, namely that the representational conventions as well as the facts and values represented are ‘predictable from … context’.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas.

  Book Title: El niño en el cine argentino de la postdictadura (1983-2008)-alegoría y nostalgia<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DUFAYS SOPHIE<br>
  Abstract: Este libro constituye la primera monografía dedicada al papel del niño en el cine latinoamericano. El análisis detallado de una decena de películas argentinas de la post-dictadura dirigidas entre 1983 y 2008, incluyendo tanto clásicas (La historia oficial, Un lugar en el mundo) como olvidadas (Amigomio, El rigor del destino), revela cómo la mirada y el lenguaje del niño son puestos al servicio de una alegoría nostálgica, estructurada en torno a la memoria o al lenguaje verbal y vinculada a la figura del padre ausente. Dufays combina los análisis fílmicos con una amplia reflexión teórica sobre las cuatro nociones clave de alegoría, melancolía, nostalgia y duelo y los articula con una genealogía de la figura alegórica del niño en las tradiciones narrativas latinoamericanas. Este recorrido permite al lector explorar las significaciones simbólicas y discursivas que el personaje infantil, la infancia y la familia han adquirido en el cine y en el contexto postdictatorial argentino. Sophie Dufays es investigadora postdoctoral del Fondo Nacional de Investigación Científica de Bélgica, en la Universidad de Louvain-la-Neuve. This book is the first monograph devoted to the role of the child in Latin American cinema. Through close analysis of about ten Argentine fiction films of the post-dictatorship period directed between 1983 and 2008, including both classic such as The Official Story and A Place in the World) and forgotten works such as Amigomío and El rigor del destino. Dufays shows how the child's gaze and language are a means of focusing a nostalgic form of allegory, structured around either memory or verbal language, and related to the figure of the absent father. In combining these analyses with a wide theoretical articulation of four key notions (allegory, melancholy, mourning and nostalgia) and with a genealogy of the allegorical child character in Latin American narrative traditions, Relatos de infancia allows the reader to explore the meanings that childhood and family have come to acquire in cinema, particularly in the Argentine post-dictatorial context.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt7zstkf">Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought</a><br>
  Author(s) Harries Karsten<br>
  Abstract: In Either/Or Kierkegaard has his aesthete A say this about the modern age: “It is conceited enough to disdain the tears of tragedy, but it is also conceited enough to want to do without mercy.

  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914–1979) is not a well-known figure in literary studies in this country. Although he has been recognized as probably the single most important experimental novelist in German since the Second World War, there is still little criticism on his work. Despite the increase in the amount of published Schmidt research over the past ten years in Germany, his works have never attracted a large readership. The linguistic density and the sophisticated cultural reflections of his texts seem to prohibit his writings from ever becoming popular. But Schmidt has at least finally gained recognition as a “giant of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81f1w">Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'</a><br>
  Abstract: According to Schmidt, 
                  Zettel’s Traum borrows its “SpaltenTechnick” from Finnegans Wake. By structuring Zettel’s Traum into three columns or “TextSträhnen,” Schmidt expects that the reader will be able to follow the information provided in the columns.¹ To ease the reading process, Schmidt divides the three columns according to theme. The center column reflects the events of the years between 1965 and 1969, the time frame in which Zettel’s Traum was actually written. Daniel Pagenstecher, as the central narrator of the events, assists Paul and Wilma Jacobi, likewise writers and old school friends, in the translation of Poe’s works into German.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81f1w">Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'</a><br>
  Abstract: Schmidt’s play with non-phonetic signs and the etym theory illustrate his fragmentary style of writing and highlights his rejection of traditional logical chains of reasoning. Instead of presenting any dogmatic truths about language, Schmidt sought to animate the reader to create his or her language through self-conscious figuration. Although the etym language might suggest a rather confining way of reading and reflecting upon language and reality, the fact is that even Schmidt, as the self-proclaimed creator of such a mode of inquiry into oral and written language, remains inscribed in his own speaking and writing. It is the reader, who,<br>

  Abstract: It would seem ironic to follow the scholarly custom of providing the reader of this text with a “conclusion,” as if to give some form of closure to the preceding inquiry. The previous chapters suggest that to summarize what I have been arguing would defeat the basic idea of this study and its object, that is, non-closure.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Book Title: Charles d'Orléans in England, 1415-1440-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Arn Mary-Jo<br>
  Abstract: Charles, duc d'Orléans, prince and poet, was a captive in England for twenty-five years following the battle of Agincourt. The studies in this volume, by European and American scholars, focus on his life and actions during that time, and show him as a serious and learned reader, a cunning political figure (accomplished in the skills that would impress the English nobility around him), and a masterful poet, innovative, witty, and intensely self-aware. Discussion of his manuscripts, his social and political relationships, his extensive library, and his poetry in two languages reveal him as a shrewd observer of life, which in his poetry he describes in ways not seen again until the Renaissance.

  Author(s) Chronister Necia<br>
  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

  Book Title: Arturo Pérez-Reverte: Narrative Tricks and Narrative Strategies-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): WALSH ANNE L.<br>
  Abstract: The writings of Arturo Pérez-Reverte, one of Spain's most renowned contemporary authors, have been described as a minefield. This monograph examines the complexities behind the narrative technique employed in creating such a minefield, including an analysis of the role played by both male and female characters, the relevance of the past as a motif, and aspects of the role of storytelling in creating mystery where none should exist. Both Revertian novels and journalistic writing are seen to be part of an over-all game which is played between their author and his readers. Film, too, forms part of the material reviewed as, though Pérez-Reverte is not a script writer, many films have been based on his novels. The text-centred analysis concludes that the themes of interest in all Revertian output revolve around two main areas: the significance of the past, whether historical, cultural, or literary, and the role of the written word in communicating, in rescuing and in challenging versions of that past in order to combat what Pérez-Reverte terms 'dismemory'.

  Abstract: As mentioned in the Introduction, this chapter intends to explore reasons why one of the pervading feelings experienced when finishing a novel by Arturo Pérez-Reverte is that of disappointment or disillusionment. It would be easy to say that such a feeling suggests a badly written novel, one that plays facile tricks on a gullible reader. However, there may be much more at stake than that. The continuing high sales of Revertian novels indicate that, gullibility aside, readers enjoy the experience of being thwarted. At some level, it seems, they are satisfied that they fail to predict the outcome. Part of<br>

  Abstract: ‘Todos miran como miro yo’ [They all look on the world as I do].¹ So states Arturo Pérez-Reverte in an interview in 2002. In this one sentence, he creates a link between author and created character that, as will be seen, has ramifications for how his novels may be interpreted. The dilemma faced by critically-aware readers is, we are told, that character and narrator and real author are not to be confused. They are separate entities, only one of which, namely the author, has any existence in real life. What happens, then, when characters in fiction exhibit traits that are<br>

  Abstract: ‘The reading invents the narrative no more than it is invented by it.’¹ This statement points to the balance existing between narrative and its reader, an area to be explored in this chapter. A story is useless without a reading while, without the story, there can be no reading and, consequently, no reader. Yet, unless a story captures its reader, it is quite likely that the reading will be prematurely ended, with the reader becoming bored and unwilling to continue being involved. What are the key elements of a good story? That question has been the subject of much debate,<br>

  Abstract: The six chapters of this study have undertaken to examine the writings of Arturo Pérez-Reverte from a number of perspectives. Chapter 1 looked at the context of this writer, the various links between his work and that of other contemporary writers in Spain, the role of narrative, its importance in telling the stories of the past and the cultural status of narrative as a link with that past. Chapter 2 considered how Pérez-Reverte’s characters could be interpreted in a variety of ways, particularly as representations of his readers.

                  História do cerco de Lisboa, who inserts a negative in a text where the author had intended none, thus changing retrospectively the course of historical events, raises some of the most pressing questions preoccupying contemporary novelists: the issues of truth and relativity, the possibility and implications of multiple authoring, and the potency of authorship as narrative authority. Impersonalizing authorship, by turning it into a process involving one or more agents and various stages, does not, however, remove textual author-ity.

Research by Javier Escudero Rodríguez has since shown that this reaction was somewhat misplaced, given that an obsession with death and an emergent interest in mysticism can be traced in Goytisolo’s fiction to at least the time ofMakbara.² Indeed, looking back even further, we might recall from the discussion above (pp. 94–5) thatJuan sin Tierraopens with an allusion to Eastern mysticism, though, admittedly, a pejorative one.

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

                     Love Medicine (Treuer 2005, 31–32). For Treuer, this Wenabozho story moreover allegorizes the quest for “authentic Indigenous culture” that so often impels readers, critics, and even authors in the field of Indigenous literature. Smartberries—discrete, displaced packets of cultural knowledge—are but signs of the literature’s desire for a holistic, tribally specific cultural understanding, and should not be mistaken for an end in themselves.<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine.

The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996).

If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Abstract: Readers without solid background knowledge of French film and colonial history may have some difficulty navigating through Eades's tightly packed, allusive prose, especially since no index of any kind is provided. This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Abstract: These criticisms and oversights notwithstanding, there are many redeeming aspects to the book. Insofar as hermeneutics and exegesis are essential for any understanding of religious texts and traditions, Thistleton's work is a good way to be introduced to a complex history, the thorny debates, and the diverse approaches that have come to constitute its history and development. And the copious references that are made throughout and at the end of each chapter will enable readers to probe more deeply into a thinker, subject, or historical period of interest to them.<br>

Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: The text covers a lot of ground, delving into many of the touch points between theology and human rights and endeavoring to demonstrate how those points can be sources of mutual enrichment rather than conflict. At times the comprehensive scope of the text, which draws on the insights of so many, makes it a challenging read and leaves the reader wanting more development and illustration of the fruits of the author’s argument. Overall, the text is an important contribution to the constructive engagement between theology and human rights discourse and is a serious challenge to those in either camp who would peremptorily reject the insights of the other.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: In his 1986 essay on the intersections between music theory, phenomenology, and perception, David Lewin develops a heuristic model through which to come to terms with the constitution of multiple and heterogeneous perceptions of musical events. One of his principal vehicles for demonstrating this phenomenological turn is the well-known analysis of Schubert's “Morgengruß.” The present article considers the ramifications of Lewin's methodology, particularly with respect to the experience of time that emerges from Lewin's mobilization of the heuristic perception model, by approaching it from the perspective of Husserl's
         Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness. This perspective reveals a superposition of temporalities as well as a superposition of languages as the underlying factors through which Lewin's analysis is produced.<br>

Abstract: The
         Left Behindnovels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have become a major publishing phenomenon in recent years. The novels have succeeded in part because they address the anxieties of their readers, using apocalyptic language to depict a future world in which evildoers are punished, and the faithful reverse the tables on their cultural marginality. The novels, however, also speak to the "here and now," articulating in narrative form the beliefs and actions that place one among either the saved or the damned. The novels accomplish this through the issuance of marks. Both believers and the followers of Antichrist have distinctive marks, which prove less than reliable. At stake, ultimately, is an evangelicalism open to the ambiguity and uncertainty of contemporary life, and a reactive fundamentalism that insists, metaphorically, on the rigidity of marks—a quest for certainty ill-advised in a world characterized by relentless change.*<br>

Abstract: In the text-based disciplines, psychoanalysis and Marxism have had a major influence on how we read, and this has been expressed most consistently in the practice of symptomatic reading, a mode of interpretation that assumes that a text's truest meaning lies in what it does not say, describes textual surfaces as superfluous, and seeks to unmask hidden meanings. For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Abstract: Every text aims to seduce its reader. If the text at the same time lays claim to having scientific value, we readers must ask whether seduction stands in the way of truth. As a concept, seduction lies halfway between an assault and conversation. As opposed to assault, seduction conveys a dimension of voluntarily being swept off one's feet. As opposed to conversation, seduction implies that one loses one's senses for a moment. Who, then, is really subject and who is object in seduction? The thesis I will argue here is that the readership's or audience's only chance of taking on the role of subjects, in a textual seduction, is to lose their senses first. Rather than being an assault against scientific ethics, seduction is a necessary premise for a sensible conversation to take place.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconstruction of the text is the condition for the possibility of its being a story that "gives life." This notion of "reader" makes possible a new model of the hermeneutical circle-one which signifies the essential roles of critical thought which follows naive reading and of informed understanding which follows after thought.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Abstract: This article suggests that two distinct modes of text-building constraints coincide in the Indonesian novel "Surabaya." The first set of constraints consists of narrative functions that shape sentence-level grammar within the story; the second level of text-building constraints shapes the thematic structure of the story. The author argues that, unlike its narrative structure, which is bound by the linearity of time, the thematic structure, of "Surabaya" is defined by a hierarchy of "heavier" and "lighter" themes, the "heavier" themes being evoked more often than are the "lighter" themes. He suggests that heaviness of theme is a strategy of text building found in classical Malaysian (Hikayat) texts, gamelan orchestra musical organization, and in calendric reckoning in much of Indonesia. He argues, in sum, for a method of writing that encourages grammatical description from two or more perspectives. "Binocular vision," to use Gregory Bateson's words, is necessary in writing to provide a more honest, richer description of a text than a single mode of grammatical description can provide; it makes available to readers more than one means of access to the text.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri di altre discipline. A questo proposito si pone per Kelley il
problema dell'atteggiamento da tenere nei confronti di studiosi come Hayden White,
Dominick LaCapra, David Harlan, teorici del linguistic turn, un modo di fare storia che
si awale delle indicazioni provenienti dall'ermeneutica di Gadamer e Ricoeur, da Hei-
degger e dai suoi discepoli francesi Foucault e Derrida, e che rifiuta ogni reale possibi-
lità di giungere a una determinazione delle intenzioni dell'autore, cioè di un «significa-
to», della verità di un'opera, e del contesto entro cui Topera è stata composta. Per Kel-
ley non era possibile evitare le implicazioni che il linguistic turn poneva, tanto piú che
esso si rivelava utile soprattutto nel rivelare risorse, strutture, memorie culturali conser-
vate nel linguaggio (topoi, tropi, metafore, analogie), non soltanto dell'alta cultura ma
anche delle forme di espressione irriflessa, o popolare (anche questo secondo un'indica-
zione di Lovejoy). Se è però vero che il significato di un testo non è univoco, è altret-
tanto vero secondo Kelley che la ricerca delle intenzioni dell'autore è premessa indi-
spensabile di qualsiasi lavoro di storia intellettuale. Quanto alia questione dell'attenzio-
ne al «contesto», che i sostenitori del linguistic turn denigrano, Kelley prende atto che
non è certamente possibile giungere alia ricostruzione dell'intera rete di relazioni entro
cui un'opera si colloca. Ciò non significa pero che il testo o l'autore studiato non pos-
sano essere collocati in un «contesto», e che quindi, attraverso lo studio del linguaggio
di un'epoca, non si riesca a ricostruire le condizioni di possibilità per la nascita di
un'opera.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; HIRSELAND, SCHNEIDER & VIEHÖVER) that continues the thread with additional articles on theory and methodology, mostly in the field of (German) Foucauldian discourse analysis. This handbook presents a collection of articles by the most influential researchers in this field and it can be regarded as representing the state-of-the-art in the German field of discourse analysis. Next, a selection of several articles related to discourse theory from an interdisciplinary conference is reviewed. The content of these papers is mainly the social theory of discourse, not discourse analytic methodology. Following this, a new and clearly written French dictionary, edited by CHARAUDEAU and MAINGUENEAU, is reviewed. It is not only the first dictionary of the French vocabulary (mainly) of FDA, but also very useful for German social research on discourse. Finally, the latest release in this field is a new and very instructive introduction to the field of social research on discourse from KELLER. This book will be very useful not only for beginners—it contains a systematic overview of the research field and discusses strategies for further discourse-analytic research.<br>

Abstract: "Cross-Cultural Research Methods" pretends to be a primer on the "how to" of conducting cross-cultural research, but focuses only on quantitative methods that use secondary data in the service of generating knowledge. The book is caught twice in the dialectic of the general and the specific, by putting all its eggs into the former basket and failing to recognize the role of the latter both in research itself and in the teaching of research methods to its readers. Because I know that the students in my graduate research methods course would fail to appreciate the book, I would neither select nor recommend it to others as a resource in teaching (quantitative) research methods or research designs courses.<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: Some literary theorists have suggested that the process of reading is a complex one and is central to the interpretation of texts. These theorists do not ignore the creation of texts or the authors' creative activities, but place special emphasis on the role of the reader. This approach has relevance for the study of the use of libraries. This paper offers an analogy between text and library and between reader and library user. The analogy is possible because both reader and user adopt intentional stances with regard to that which is to be interpreted and employ cognitive and affective means in interpretation. At the heart of this approach is a phenomenological-hermeneutical way of thinking that treats reading and library use as an event consisting of varying intention and interpretive possibilities.<br>

Abstract: This paper suggests Charles Reznikoff's poetry should be assessed in its relation to the Jewish hermeneutical tradition. Philosopher Paul Ricœur's quotation in the title, "the very deciphering of life in the mirror of the text," sums up Reznikoff's poetical strategy. He decontextualizes his writing by displacing it towards its hypotextual origin, Jewish and non-Jewish. Reading destabilizes the reader who embraces the poetical text in the mirror of its hypotexts. This move metaphorically takes reading and writing away from their familiar American grounds and paves the way for an ethics of perambulation.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I explore the questions of why and how sociologists should be interested in narrative. The answer to the first question is straightforward: Narrative texts are packed with sociological information, and a great deal of our empirical evidence is in narrative form. In an attempt to answer the second question, I look at definitions of narrative, distinguishing narrative from non-narrative texts. I highlight the linguistic properties of narrative and illustrate modes of analysis, paying close attention to both the structural properties of the text and its subtle linguistic nuances. I guide the reader through a detailed analysis of a short narrative text. I show how linguistics and sociology interplay at the level of a text.<br>

en México, en 1949, Neruda había dicho que en los últimos años "maestros snobs se han
apoderado de Kafka, de Rilke, de todos los laberintos que no tengan salida, de todas las
metafísicas que han ido cayendo, como cajones vacíos desde el tren de la historia [...]" ("Mi
país, como ustedes saben..." 765).<br>

Slave narratives, in general, and Frederick Douglass’s works, in particular, have created a serious difficulty for their modern readers and interpreters as representations of the otherwise silent community of black slaves. Silence here denotes their inability to enter certain domains of discourse. Thus, they appear` silent despite the rich African American traditions of music, song, and story-telling, which helped to preserve their cultural identity but could not be written into the mainstream culture. The article poses questions concerning the ability of one intellectual voice to represent the collectivity of black experience and of black slaves. This does not diminish the literary value of Douglass's writing but undermines the use of it as a historical document<br>

Abstract: The paper examines the process of figurative reading in the presence of a marker (like / as), namely the unique cognitive impact caused by shaping figurative expressions as similes. The solution is sought through theoretical discussion and analysis of relevant excerpts from Hebrew poetry. Recently Bethlehem argued that a simile does not necessarily indicate the presence of resemblance of some sort; the simile only presents itself as such via its marker, like/as, but actually it can bear a variety of figurative relations, of which metaphoric relations are only one possible option. Consequently, simile has only coincidental relations with metaphor, if any (Bethlehem, 1996: 1997) First I address this criticism, trying to reinforce the widespread view that a simile is indeed a sub-type of metaphor, and that there is no fundamental difference between them, that is, comprehension processes in metaphor and simile are basically similar. Next I distinguish the simile from the literal comparison in a new comprehensive way. Finally I try to identify and study the special impression a figurative expression might create as a result of being shaped as a simile. Despite this basic sameness of simile and metaphor, the marker's presence in a simile has its unique cognitive effects, accumulating to a distinctive impact. I analyze the unique cognitive effects potentially evolved during the construction process of the simile's meaning. In this analysis this paper reexamines central issues pertaining to similes, their essence, and the cognitive processes they trigger in readers. Among these I focus on a problem never thoroughly explored so far: the essential nature of the coexistence of similarity and dissimilarity (without working against each other) in both metaphor and simile.<br>

Abstract: Augustine applies rhetorical principles of On Christian Doctrine to Book Eight of the Confessions by synthesizing four conversion stories as reenactments of the gospel paradigm. This pattern invites readers to repeat that reenactment. Thus Augustine's rhetorical design rather than a self-analysis or compulsion to confess informs the Confessions as autobiography.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: The following essay explores the nature of theory within the interdisciplinary space we call literature and theology—or more generally religion and literature—and the role theory has played in that space's collective practice. It argues that theory is natural to the 'binding' of religion with literature and of literature with religion, since both are caught in a dilemma of reading, including the 'reading' of the practices that mark each of their respective disciplines. The discussion then looks at the spectatorial nature of the ancient notion of theory as theoria, before it traces how theory, in moving from theoria to high Theory, has figured in the 25 volumes of Literature and Theology itself. This tracing covers a double assumption of theory and an appropriation of the 'other' as theory. The essay concludes by looking at the dynamic that continues to bind literature and theology, and indeed the readers of a journal such as this one, in a communality of theory, practice, and interpretation.<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object here. It contributes to the matter of the article and its interpretation is interwoven with the theoretical substance. The story is shown to be an integrated narrative abounding in sophisticated linguistic techniques which show a delight in language. The traditional Christian and Western interpretation of Babel – as an affront to God which results in the curse of multilingualism – is challenged. A re-constructed interpretation informed by intertextual evidence reads the fault of Babel to be the people's refusal to spread through the earth. Babel can be interpreted as a manifesto against the monolingual and monocultural impetus of empires ancient and contemporary. The multilingual outcome is a positive affirmation of sociocultural and linguistic diversity.<br>

Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: In commenting on Coulter and Smith (2009), the author explores issues related to the place of the political in education research and in literature, but especially in forms of narrative research that possess both scientific and literary dimensions. More specifically, the author examines four sets of issues related to the researching and writing of forms of narrative composition that exhibit an overtly progressivist orientation. These issues involve (a) the fundamental purposes for which the research is undertaken, (b) the role of opposing tropisms operating through textual design elements that tend to promote or discourage multiple perspectives, (c) ethical issues related to assumed privileges of authorship by the researcher, and (d) the political prerogatives and responsibilities of readers of literary forms of narrative research in education.<br>

Abstract: Edward Jerningham's "Impenitence" (1800)—a translation of Bossuet's "Sermon du mauvais riche" (1662)—is remarkably dissimilar to its French original. This article investigates the rhetorical reasons behind this discrepancy. These reasons concern the problems of promoting a French model of eloquence in a fiercely anti-French climate and—even more problematic—promoting a text whose main theme is a denunciation of the rich in a period of extreme counter-revolutionary fervor. Jerningham's text shows that in facing potentially resistant readers, the strategies of a translator are those of a rhetor.<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Abstract: The present essay examines the ideological implications of Luis Cernuda's "Ninfa y pastor por Ticiano." In the Poem Cernuda uses ekphrasis as a springboard for the exploration of creative desire, transforming Titian's painting into an erotic generator of creativity. The erotic center of the painting—the nymph's form—becomes a mirror in whose light are reflected and merged the speaker's, Titian's, and the reader's creative desires. Starting from a position of radical dissent, the poem critiques canonical visual values with respect to the viewing subject, moral values as expressed and represented by the Christian story of man/woman's creation, and, more widely, by producing a deviation of readerly desire, it critiques the traditional codes of control and power relations in which we are immersed.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews the recent interest in the literary aspects of ethnographic writing, concentrating on the work of Geertz, Sperber and the authors associated with the collective volume Writing culture. While it is argued that serious questions are raised in some of this work, it is also argued that recent fashions in literary critical theory may prove unhelpful in addresing those questions. In particular, the tendency to read texts with little or no consideration for the social and historical context in which they were written seems an especially barren approach. Instead it is argued that anthropology is as much a way of working-a kind of practical activity-as it is a way of writing. Acknowledgement of the personal element in the making of ethnographic texts may help the reader to a better assessment of the interpretation on offer; more radical change requires a change in anthropological practice as well as in anthropological writing.<br>

Abstract: Traditional discourses upon literature have been predicated upon the ability to refer to a text that others may consult (Landow, 1994, p. 33). Texts that involve elements of feedback and nontrivial decision-making on the part of the reader (Aarseth, 1997, p. 1) therefore present a challenge to readers and critics alike. Since a persuasive case has been made against a critical method that sets out to "identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and territorial mastery" (Aarseth, p. 87), this paper proposes the use of readers in an empirically based approach to hypertext fiction. Meta-interpretation, a method that combines individual responses to a text, reading logs, screen recordings and limited qualitative/quantitative analysis, and critical interpretation is outlined. By analysing readers' responses it is possible to suggest both the ways that textual elements may have influenced or determined readers' choices and the ways that readers' choices "configure" the text. The method thus addresses Espen Aarseth's concerns and illuminates interesting features of interactive processes in fictional environments. The paper is divided into two parts: the first part sketches out meta-interpretation through consideration of the main problems confronting the literary critic; the second part describes reading research aimed at generating data for the literary critic.<br>

Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Author(s): Yaroshevsky Peter<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the "transactional zone." The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)<br>

Abstract: Assessing the limits of evolutionary and cognitive approaches to the study of culture goes to the heart of an issue that tends to divide humanists and scientists. The issue is how far, in dealing with complex cultural texts and the complex transactions we perform as readers, can we advance by scientific reduction? The issue is vexed by the fact that at times the complexity and novelty of humanistic discourse is little more than obfuscation and strained ingenuity. But such failings discredit neither the search for novelty, nor the earned perception of irreducible complexity, nor the immense importance of work that is necessarily, and terminally, speculative.<br>

Abstract: Memory, persistence, and cultural transmission are hot topics in anthropology today. Contributing to an increasing anthropological interest in youth agency, in this article I invite readers to look at youth as a crucial site for understanding issues of religious memory and cultural transmission. In the past five decades, Bulongic people (Guinea-Conakry) have undergone significant religious changes caused by the introduction of Islam, which has led to the official disappearance of pre-Islamic rituals. In this article, I explore how young Bulongic remember a pre-Islamic past that they have never experienced. I argue that, to understand how they assimilate and perpetuate this religious heritage, one must examine the subtle processes of intergenerational transmission through which their memories are dynamically shaped.<br>

Abstract: Michel Tournier is the most controversial French writer alive today. His fiction has provided fertile ground for diverse, often conflicting theoretical practices, and sharpened critiques, yet the author himself has remained aloof and is often perplexed at the way in which his work is received. Focusing on one story from Le Médianoche amoureux (1989), this article records a quest for the essential Tournier. Under the auspices of a master narrator, the reader of "Pyrotechnie" embarks on a voyage of discovery, which is ultimately one of self-discovery, for it finishes, delightfully, in the story-telling world of the child.<br>

Abstract: This essay considers the persistence of collective and corporate models of literary authority within late-Victorian literature and print culture. While modern critics often understand Victorian authorship to be individually centered and governed by a dynamic of secrecy and disclosure, the periodical debates about anonymity that intensified in the fin de siècle suggest that Victorian readers and writers embraced a more flexible, collective notion of authorship. The plot, language, and paratext of Mary Elizabeth Hawker's pseudonymously published Mademoiselle Ixe, as well as the author-publisher correspondence concerning the novel, offer a representation of the corporate and collective interpretive modes that would have been familiar to late-Victorian readers, if not to recent critics. Hawker's text and the archival material it brings to light also suggest that modern readers might productively turn to the Victorian past to expand the definitions of authorship that circulate throughout nineteenth-century scholarship today.<br>

Abstract: Although anthropologists have discredited use of the liberal and secular concept of "agency" for explaining Muslim women's behavior, their evidence comes from women who still appear rather agentive to Western readers, hence, muting the necessity and consequences of discovering and applying the women's own ethical and religious terms in their analysis. In Guinea's rural Fouta Djallon, women are not prone to mobilize and make self-interested decisions with immediately observable outcomes. Therefore, understanding them on their own terms requires greater attention to their religious frameworks, namely, to their use of visions of creation and afterlife to define themselves and strategize for redemption.<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: In a variety of ways, all ethnographies are politically cast and policy relevant. Each of three recurrent political rhetorics is related to a unique set of fieldwork practices. Ethnographies that report holistically on journeys to "the other side" build policy/political significance by contesting popular stereotypes. Theoretical ethnographies draw on political imagination to fill in for a lack of variation in participant observation data and to model an area of social life without attempting to rule out alternative explanations. Comparative analytic studies build political relevance by revealing social forces that are hidden by local cultures. Each of these three genres of ethnographic methodology faces unique challenges in relating fieldwork data to politically significant explanations. By shaping the ethnographers relations to subjects and readers, each methodology also structures a distinctive class identity for the researchers-as worker, as aristocrat, or as bourgeois professional.<br>

Abstract: A fierce opponent of the historicist approach to literature that dominated French academe during his lifetime, the essayist and poet Charles Péguy (1873–1914) would theorize an alternative literary method that through the act of faithful and participatory reading could transcend the limitations of historicism. Outlined in his dialogue with History, Clio, Péguy's vision of the literary act is that of an intersubjective operation of mutual understanding between reader and author, in which the living relevance of literary works extends beyond their narrow historical origins; a conception that prefigures the formalist and hermeneutic literary approaches that will arise decades later.<br>

Abstract: How best to avoid the Levinas Effect, as it has been called, the tendency to make Emmanuel Levinas everything to everyone? One way is to demonstrate that Levinas's thinking does not fit into any of the categories by which we ordinarily approach political theory. If one were forced to categorize Levinas's political theory, the term "inverted liberalism " would come closest to the mark. As long, that is, as one emphasizes the term "inverted" over "liberalism." Levinas's defense of liberalism is likely the strangest defense the reader has encountered. We should, argues Levinas, foster and protect the individual because only the individual can see the tears of the other, the tears that even the just regime cannot see. The individual is to be fostered and protected for the sake of the other individual. Whether this has anything to do with "real" liberalism, and whether it should, is the topic of this essay.<br>

Abstract: The book Letters Across the Divide: Two Friends Explore Racism, Friendship, and Faith embodies a dialogic rhetoric with significant potential to influence its intended audience to accept the need for racial atonement and reconciliation. It exemplifies what Aaron Gresson calls a "dance of agency" in both its interpersonal exchanges and constructed relationship with readers. Bringing white and black voices, individual and collective concerns, and (interpersonal and public discourse into dialogue, Letters demonstrates the transformative power of "voice," which mediates the "authenticity" of Buberian dialogic rhetoric and the cultural performances of Bakhtinian dialogism. The fact that the white coauthor boldly affirms commonplaces of white resistance increases the likelihood that white readers would identify with and be influenced by his profound attitudinal change in dialogue with his black friend. The coherence and credibility ofthat transformation depend upon the prefigurai power of the authors' shared religious narrative—both enabling and constraining Letters' influence on public racial reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris" vividly embodies the problems surrounding the semantic status of fantastic utterances. It poses the problems as two related questions: what is the "objective" meaning of the notion of the Solarian ocean for the Solarist researchers in the novel, and what is the "symbolic" meaning of the novel's fantastic ocean for its readers. Since the diegetic planet Solaris has no objective relation to the meaning-producing dynamics of human work, the Solarian ocean is a projection of familiar human meanings. As for the fantastic ocean represented for the reader, it can be approached via several semantic interpretations, none of which are fully adequate. Three such approaches are the plasmatic, i.e., the different descriptions of the ocean are instances of the dominant metasemic lexeme "plasma"; the vaginal, i.e., the ocean is a displaced image of female sexuality; and the schizophrenic, i.e., the ocean is an instance of a schizophrenic "miraculation-machine" (derived from Deleuze-Guattari's Anti-Oedipus).<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that historical interpretation of the New Testament is necessary to provide information for setting the parameters of valid readings of the New Testament. Such an interpretation serves the purpose of alienation between reader and text and enables the interpreter to ask critical questions about the communicability and relevance of these texts. The nature of the New Testament necessitates historical interpretation. Current historico-critical interpretation of the New Testament is discussed and evaluated with a view to possibilities and limitations in the light of current developments in literary science, history of philosophy and historiography.<br>

Abstract: The linguistic structures of the letter of Jude encode and articulate important religious and social meanings, such as the author and his readers' (and their adversaries') position within their social universe, as well as their beliefs, practices, norms and values. At the same time the letter also affects the circumstances which occasioned its writing, whether to expose and label Jude's opponents as evil intruders who must be exposed of, or to actively maintain the religious purity of the community to which it is addressed. Jude's language is a language of social and religious control.<br>

Abstract: In a first part, the article tells the story of the Hermeneutics Group of the NTSSA. It is a story with three phases. In the first phase, interpretation was seen as more than the application of methods. In the second phase, the active role of the reader became more important. In the third phase, the importance of interpretive communities became more apparent. In a second part, some of the issues resulting from these developments are discussed under the rubric 'Why do we interpret the New Testament?' In a third part, the question is raised whether the Hermeneutics Group (and the NTSSA?) may be entering a new phase in its scholarly activity of dialogue with other reader-communities.<br>

Abstract: Are the readings of Luke being proposed in this volume evidence of readers finding in the text what they want? Different readings of the same text can be related to different manifestations of "the reader". Yet a responsible reading of the text implies taking the text as a speech-act functioning in a communicative context. The role of the author and the context therefore becomes important again. The concept of foolproof composition is relevant too ās it implies the exclusion of the possibility of a counterreading of the text. Tlie phenomenon of the inspiration of a sacred text also functions as a constraint.<br>

Abstract: The different "readings and readers" are evaluated, with a view to responsible hermeneutics, on three levels. First, the question is asked as to whether the different readings took place in a responsible way in terms of their own presuppositions and goals. Some general remarks are made on the possible comparison and integration of these readings are made. Second, the question is asked whether some of these readings are more appropriate, responsible or legitimate readings of literature than others. The point is argued that such an evaluation cannot be timeless and abstract, but will depend on the purpose of the reader. Third, the question is asked how the specific pencope, namely a text from the Christian New Testament, can be responsibly read by New Testament scholars.<br>

Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Abstract: In attempting to achieve some form of mapping between consciousness (specifically, consciousness₆) and cognition, I distinguish between a weak and a strong version of the hypothesis, indicating a change in mode of thinking of a metaphoric-symbolic nature (Glicksohn, 1993). The weak version would claim that metaphors, symbols, analogies and images are used in an attempt to depict the experience, which is not easily translatable into words. The strong version would claim that metaphoric thinking is one of the hallmarks of the experience, and is used both in an attempt to depict the experience and also to convey to the reader, and possibly to induce in the reader, some of the qualities of that experience. My discussion of these two options is preceded by some comments on problems inherent in studying altered or alternate states of consciousness. I also discuss the relationships among physiognomic perception, cognitive dedifferentiation, and symbolic cognition.<br>

Abstract: This article looks at the short stories of Saadat Hasan Manto in Urdu about the Partition and of Orkeny, a Hungarian Jewish writer about the Holocaust and finds that by adopting a critical distance both Manto and Orkeny were able to evolve narrative strategies which invited the readers' response and stimulated agency. By countering moralising and sentimentality in their narrative strategies they enabled the reader to deal with and go beyond the paralysing effects of such traumatic experiences.<br>

Abstract: While the Good Friday Agreement heralded a new beginning in Northern Ireland, its promotion of amnesty and amnesia, and its "rhetorical dismemberment of the past," effectively occluded the experiences of victims. Rather than engage in the seductive embrace of cultural amnesia, much Northern Irish art focuses upon the dangers of forgetting the past. For visual artists and writers alike, a wilful neglect of history may result in the return of the repressed and in psychic breakdown on both the communal and individual levels. Works by Jack Pakenham, Ciaran Carson, Colin Davidson, Frank McGuinness, and Willie Doherty use the trope of "haunting" to allow readers/viewers to bear witness to the plight of those left behind by the Agreement's rhetoric and to understand their post-conflict trauma. Bien que l'Accord du Vendredi saint annonçât un nouveau début pour l'Irlande du Nord, il eut comme résultat, de par sa promotion d'une amnistie combinée à une amnésie forcée, ainsi que son démembrement rhétorique du passé, de nier le vécu des victimes. Plutôt que de se laisser subjuguer par la séduction de l'amnésie culturelle, une grande partie de l'expression artistique de l'Irlande du Nord se concentre sur le danger d'oublier le passé. Pour les plasticiens aussi bien que les écrivains, une négligence délibérée de l'histoire pourrait ramener la répression et occasionner des blessures psychiques aussi bien au niveau communautaire que de l'individu. Les œuvres de Jack Pakenham, Ciaran Carson, Colin Davidson, Frank McGuinness, et Willie Doherty déploient le trope de la « hantise » pour permettre aux lecteurs et au public de témoigner de la souffrance de ceux qui ont été laissés pour compte par la rhétorique de l'Accord, et de mieux comprendre leur traumatisme post-conflit<br>

Abstract: This essay redefines the task of the reader in light of Christian hope, unfolding how a theology of hope might ground literary criticism. The resulting approach to literature—hopeful reading—considers texts in light of their future becoming in the Kingdom of God. Rather than considering texts as purveyors of hope or possibility for a readers future, hopeful reading asks critics to non-instrumentally foreground the possibilities in a text's future. The essay explains Christian hope, shows how it might warrant and construct a literary critic's vocation, and offers several extended examples of contemporary critics who seem to be reading hopefully.<br>

Abstract: Whereas the spoken word is part of present actuality, the written word normally is not. The writer, in isolation, constructs a role for his "audience" to play, and readers fictionalize themselves to correspond to the author's projection. The way readers fictionalize themselves shifts throughout literary history: Chaucer, Lyly, Nashe, Hemingway, and others furnish cases in point. All writing, from scientific monograph to history, epistolary correspondence, and diary writing, fictionalizes its readers. In oral performance, too, some fictionalizing of audience occurs, but in the live interaction between narrator and audience there is an existential relationship as well: the oral narrator modifies his story in accord with the real-not imagined-fatigue, enthusiasm, or other reactions of his listeners. Fictionalizing of audiences correlates with the use of masks or personae marking human communication generally, even with oneself. Lovers try to strip off all masks, and oral communication in a context of love can reduce masks to a minimum. In written communication and, a fortiori, print the masks are less removable.<br>

Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Abstract: The frames that Lewis Carroll provided for the two Alice books have largely been ignored, when not simply dismissed, in recent Carroll criticism. Their conventional form and diction may account for this negative response, but examination of their provenance, their function within the structure of the two books, and the artistry evident in the individual frame components indicate how and why the frames are important to our understanding of Carroll's vision and purpose. The frame poems are designed to lead the reader into and away from the central dream tales through a process of lyric transformation and estrangement.<br>

Abstract: The conceptual dominance of the "heterosexual" in modern thinking has conditioned us, when we consider the Canterbury Tales, to think about the Pardoner and his audience in essentialist terms. The Pardoner and the Host's kiss, however, stills and defers attempts by the masculine gaze of Harry and the "redeemed" pilgrims to control what the Pardoner means. By returning meaning to circulation, the kiss provides an instance in which the Pardoner's body can do more than simply deconstruct categories or gesture elsewhere for meaning. Offering an alternative view of the Pardoner's supposed "destructive otherness," this essay suggests that his true import lies not in his alterity but in his similarity to the other pilgrims and ultimately to us as readers-in short, that the Pardoner constitutes the "open secret" of the Canterbury project.<br>

Abstract: The fortunes of epiphany indicate both recent historical disparities within literary criticism and current cultural disparities between academic and popular discourse. The contextualist practice of Wordsworth and Joyce, in contrast to the purist theory that arose with the New Criticism, suggests that epiphany is a narrative device underscoring the historical and cultural construction of character. This conception is borne out by the original Epiphany, in Matthew, which manifests divine personality to human eyes through an episode of cultural difference and accommodation. Robert Browning's historicist poetry uses comparable but secular means of manifesting personality. In his dramatic monologues "Karshish," "My Star," and " 'Transcendentalism,' " epiphanic themes serve as measures of their speakers' cultural construction. In discerning the relative differentiae that characterize such speakers, Browning's readers encounter their own relativity to interpretive conditions. As these examples imply, the modern literary epiphany ultimately effects the hermeneutic manifestation of the reader.<br>

Abstract: Does a literary text remain the same object across time? This essay answers no and bases a defense of literature on that answer. Temporal extension, a phenomenon neglected in contemporary literary studies, makes some meanings unrecoverable and others newly possible. A text endures as a nonintegral survivor, an echo of what it was and of what it might become, its resonance changing with shifts in interpretive contexts. Since this resonance cannot be addressed by synchronic historicism, I propose an alternative, diachronic historicism, inspired especially by scientific theories on background noise, by Einstein's account of the relativity of simultaneity, and by critiques of the visual bias in Western epistemology. I try to theorize the text as a temporal continuum, thick with receding and incipient nuances, exercising the ears of readers in divergent ways and yielding its words to contrary claims. Literature thus encourages a semantic democracy that honors disagreement as a crucial fact of civil society.<br>

Abstract: The relationships among texts, readers, and moral community are explored in order to understand the dissonance and interplay of personal and textual authority in local Islamic practice (Sunni, Shaf'i branch) among Malagasy-speaking villagers of Mayotte (Comoro Islands, East Africa). A political economy of knowledge approach is linked to an analysis of recitation as a ritual activity in which illocutionary force exceeds referential meaning. The discussion has relevance for the understanding of the relationship between religious knowledge, power, and action in Islamic societies as well as of the interface between the oral and the written more generally.

Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Abstract: The new information technologies have transformed reading practices in meaningful ways, promoting other skills and competences, and activating new ways of interacting with reading devices. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Mexico City, this article aims to explore how communicational innovations have had an impact on a specific type of reader, whose distinctive feature is to have an intense and/or enjoyable relationship with the act of read: the cultural creators. The analysis of these practices and the reflection as a result of this, allows us to observe that, far from creating isolated readers, the emerging technologies contribute to develop, in other ways,the potential for the sociability of reading, thus stimulating work networks and collaborative projects.<br>

Abstract: The longstanding critical refrain that Virginia Woolf's fiction represents a turn ““inward”” to the vagaries of the inner life has more recently been countered with an ““outward”” approach emphasizing Woolf's interest in the material world, its everyday objects and their social and political significance. Yet one of the most curious and pervasive features of Woolf's oeuvre is that characters are so frequently wrong in their perceptions. This essay consolidates the inward and outward approaches by tracing the trope of misperception in Woolf's fiction as well as in her conceptions of the work of author and reader. For Woolf, the modern literary experience derives from the nature of the faculties of perception, the tenuous points of connection —— and disjunction —— between the inner and the outer worlds.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: A book proposing an overview of “African literature” is a very attractive proposition to the new reader seeking orientation in a vast and fastgrowing vibrant field, to the expert in one area looking to explore others, and perhaps also to the publisher with a canny eye to the bottom line. This essay examines the often bewildering array of apparent subcategories that emerge in some key texts published around the turn of the twentieth-first century that purport to offer an overview of African literature in French, but which seem to entirely set aside important international debates over “postcolonial,” diaspora, and hybridity, among others. These texts have an important role in the construction of knowledge of “African literature,” but their strengths and limitations become clear when we look closely at the categories suggested and no more so than when the category happens to be that of “identity.”<br>

Abstract: This article reviews recent methodological interventions in the field of literary study, many of which take nineteenth-century critics, readers, or writers as models for their less interpretive reading practices. In seeking out nineteenth-century models for twenty-first-century critical practice, these critics imagine a world in which English literature never became a discipline. Some see these new methods as formalist, yet we argue that they actually emerge from historicist self-critique. Specifically, these contemporary critics view the historicist projects of the 1980s as overly influenced by disciplinary models of textual interpretation—models that first arose, we show through our reading of the Jolly Bargemen scene in Charles Dickens's
         Great Expectations(1860– 61), in the second half of the nineteenth century. In closing, we look more closely at the work of a few recent critics who sound out the metonymic, adjacent, and referential relations between readers, texts, and historical worlds in order sustain historicism's power to restore eroded meanings rather than reveal latent ones.<br>

They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: The articles collected here represent the richness and diversity of philosophical work presented at SPEP and thus serve to vindicate Steinbock's vision, expressed in his Co-director's Address, of SPEP as an organization that is grounded in a fundamental openness to experience that leads it to continually push against its own limits and thus to reimagine itself.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: Elizabeth Bowen subjects both her characters and her readers to the dynamics of nostalgia in two of her novels.
         The House in ParisandThe Little Girlsare unique in Bowen'soeuvrein their use of “structural nostalgia”—a tripartite structure containing a section that takes place in the past put between two sections that take place in the present. Though this structure suggests that readers may simply engage in a nostalgic return along with the characters, Bowen uses it instead to force both her characters and her readers into a conscious examination of both the pleasures and the problems created by nostalgia.<br>

Abstract: In the essay I adopt Tamar Yacobi's “communication model” for settling discrepancies and inconsistencies in fictional texts and use it to demonstrate that the hypothesis of unreliable narration does not necessarily entail only one kind of interpretation. To support this point, I offer the distinction between
         self-deceptiveandother-deceptivenarrating characters, and I argue that some texts constantly cause the reader to hesitate between conflicting interpretations of the narrator as belonging to one of these two types. Such equivocation on the part of the reader is then extended to competing interpretations of the text, in accordance with each type of narrator. The chosen novel for this purpose is Vladimir Nabokov'sLolita.<br>

Abstract: Most scholars dealing with unreliable narration consider the unreliable narrator inferior to the reader in either knowledge or morality. This conception implies that the readers are more reliable than the unreliable narrator and, thanks to this difference, capable of identifying unreliabilty, with no consequences or ramifications for themselves. Although this view is not entirely wrong, the readers' superiority to the narrator may change if the readers either find out new details about the narrator that urge them to reevaluate their classification or discover something new about themselves that encourages them to reconsider their superiority. An interesting combination of these two possibilities is found in Camus's novella
         The Fall(La Chute). My interpretation ofThe Fallfocuses on the triad narrator-narratee-reader and the narrator's rhetorical manipulations, maintaining that the text both undermines the binary opposition between “unreliable narrator” and “reliable reader” and has some general implications on the position of the reader towards fiction.<br>

Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>

Abstract: This essay places before the reader four historic texts that raise significant questions for Jews and Christians who choose to enter into post-Holocaust examination of their respective identities and their relationships to their grounding traditions. The Kristallnacht exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum introduces museum visitors to the defaced Talmudic instruction of R. Eliezer—
         Know before whom you stand-which frames this essay. As with the story the museum recounts, more than texts are at stake in this essay, but the way forward is distinctly framed by their critical presence. In this case, the distinctive texts are faced in reconfiguring ways, asking those who face them to rethink the place of the other in their identities and life-orienting commitments. Early on, Samuel Bak's surrealistic rendering of a crucified, Jewish child provides a refracting image for exploring the questions these texts pose for post-Shoah people of faith who take their place before them, asking in recursive fashion: before whom do you stand?<br>
