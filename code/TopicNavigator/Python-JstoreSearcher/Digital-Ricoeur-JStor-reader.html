  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: “And, you all know, security is mortals’ chiefest enemy.” These are the words of Hecate to the three Witches in
                  Macbeth.A modern reader may experience momentary difficulty in constructing a meaning for them, sincesecurityhas come to be regarded in twentieth-century anglophone culture as one of the chiefest goods. Hecate’s words are thus paradoxical, unless one is a critic of the security culture itself. Shakespeare and his contemporaries, however, although they had begun to use the word also in something like its modern sense, knew a different meaning based on the word's Latin etymology.Securityderives fromse<br>

  Book Title: The Red Sea-In Search of Lost Space<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wick Alexis<br>
  Abstract: The Red Sea has, from time immemorial, been one of the world's most navigated spaces, in the pursuit of trade, pilgrimage and conquest. Yet this multidimensional history remains largely unrevealed by its successive protagonists. Intrigued by the absence of a holistic portrayal of this body of water and inspired by Fernand Braudel's famous work on the Mediterranean, this book brings alive a dynamic Red Sea world across time, revealing the particular features of a unique historical actor. In capturing this heretofore lost space, it also presents a critical, conceptual history of the sea, leading the reader into the heart of Eurocentrism. The Sea, it is shown, is a vital element of the modern philosophy of history.Alexis Wick is not satisfied with this inclusion of the Red Sea into history and attendant critique of Eurocentrism. Contrapuntally, he explores how the world and the sea were imagined differently before imperial European hegemony. Searching for the lost space of Ottoman visions of the sea,
      The Red Seamakes a deeper argument about the discipline of history and the historian's craft.<br>

  Author(s) CARPENTER EDMUND<br>
  Abstract: The following essay by Henry Munn presents a necessary complication of the ʺoralityʺ issue in ethnopoetics (see above, passim)—the location of a concept of ʺbookʺ and ʺwritingʺ at center of the genuine ethnopoetics of a major oral poet (see above, p. 187). The interested reader can relate it to the proposal of an archécriture (or primal writing)—the idea of writing itself as, in David Antinʹs term, a ʺnatural genreʺ co-equal with speech, etc.—presented in the workings of such a contemporary philosopher as Jacques Derrida (see above, p. 139).

  Book Title: Lectura Dantis-Purgatorio, A Canto-by-Canto Commentary<br>

  Author(s): ROSS CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: This new critical volume, the second to appear in the three-volume
      Lectura Dantis,contains expert, focused commentary on thePurgatorioby thirty-three international scholars, each of whom presents to the nonspecialist reader one of the cantos of the transitional middle cantica of Dante's unique Christian epic. The cast of characters is as colorful as before, although this time most of them are headed for salvation. The canto-by-canto commentary allows each contributor his or her individual voice and results in a deeper, richer awareness of Dante's timeless aspirations and achievements.<br>

  Abstract: To the modern reader this canto might seem at first to be of a somewhat remote and antiquarian interest with, at best, a certain formal and old-fashioned poetic beauty. Coming immediately after the richly textured account of humankind’s lost paradise on earth and of the beautiful lady who explains it to Dante, Canto XXIX introduces a series of symbols from which the reader is required to deduce a corresponding series of “other meanings.” It would appear, therefore, to belong to that outmoded form, the allegory, and indeed virtually all commentators agree that it is an allegorical presentation of the history<br>

  Abstract: Richard Posner lists several reasons to think that morality and law are enterprises distinct from literature: the fact that the heinous actions of German lawyers and citizens in the 1930s and 1940s coexisted with Germany’s status as one of the most cultured nations of the world; the circumstance that one of the well-known abilities of many well-read people is to remain insensitive to the suffering of others; the fact that moral atrocities fill the literary canon without affecting either the aesthetic virtues of the work or its reader’s own moral attitudes; and, finally, the distance between the concerns of law<br>

  Abstract: Torn between antinomies, the life of Baba Tatsui (1850–88) bears a Romantic aspect. Indeed, given Baba’s early, lonely death in a strange land (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), his biographers have seldom resisted the trope of Romantic tragedy in describing his turbulent career and sad demise. Nakae Chōmin’s touching reminiscence of his friend and fellow Jiyūtō (Liberal Party) member begins by evoking Baba’s death in the “Meriken” hospital.¹ Yasunaga Gōro starts his rather hagiographic narrative at Baba’s tall grave marker in the Woodlands Cemetery.² The opening pages of Hagihara Nobutoshi’s 1967 biography continue this convention, inviting the reader to imagine Baba’s almost<br>

  Book Title: The Shriek of Silence-A Phenomenology of the Holocaust Novel<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): PATTERSON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The Shriek of Silenceis a first in several respects: the first to examine the Holocaust novels in their original languages, the first to articulate a theoretical basis for its approach, and the first phenomenological investigation -- one that attempts to penetrate the process of creation for these novelists. Organized along conceptual lines, the book examines "the word in exile," the themes of death of the father and the child, transformations of the self, and the implications of the reader. Its philosophical foundations are Rosenzweig, Buber, Neher, and Levinas. Its critical approach is shaped by Bakhtin.<br>

                  Crediting Poetry(13). Within the context of his Nobel lecture, Seamus Heaney’s observation reminds the reader that even the apparent innocence of childhood is in fact nothing less than a school “for the complexities of his adult predicament.” In a profound sense, Heaney’s insight at once harkens back to the narrow limits of his first world, as well as the nexus of forces that constitutes its ground. At the same time, it illuminates Heaney’s artistic passage beyond his home,<br>

  Author(s) Connors Catherine<br>
  Abstract: It is a commonplace of modern scholarship on the
                  Metamorphosesof Apuleius that the deployment of elements from Greek and Roman epic, easily recognisable by the cultured bilingual elite reader of the high Roman Empire, plays a crucial role in the literary self-definition and reception of Apuleius’ novel.² On the one hand, the appearance of such features suggests that the novel shows a significant similarity to epic in literary ambition; on the other hand, the comic or parodic manner in which such features are often treated serves to maintain a suitable generic distance between lofty epic poetry and prose fiction,<br>

  Abstract: The Catholic Studies Reader is a rare book in an emerging field that has neither a documented history nor a consensus as to what should be a normative methodology. Dividing this volume into five interrelated themes central to the practice and theory of Catholic Studies-Sources and Contexts, Traditions and Methods, Pedagogy and Practice, Ethnicity, Race, and Catholic Studies, and The Catholic Imagination-the editors provide readers with the opportunity to understand the great diversity within this area of study. Readers will find informative essays on the Catholic intellectual tradition and Catholic social teaching, as well as reflections on the arts and literature. This provocative and enriching collection is valuable not only for scholars but also for lay and religious Catholics working in Catholic education in universities, high schools, and parish schools.<br>

  Author(s): WIRZBA NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: This collection of ground-breaking essays considers the many dimensions of prayer: how prayer relates us to the divine; prayer's ability to reveal what is essential about our humanity; the power of prayer to transform human desire and action; and the relation of prayer to cognition. It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F.

  Abstract: As I intimated in the preceding chapter, the project of reshaping the feminine in contemporary liturgical discourse—and thereby destabilizing the male-centered symbolic that has dominated Judaism—can proceed without relying on philological and historical research, but the re/envisioning is proportionately impoverished to the degree that it neglects or obfuscates the tradition it purports to reflect. I am not so naïve as to ignore the fact that shared existential circumstances impact the reader’s interpretative stance. On the contrary, I readily acknowledge that the reader is prejudiced by hermeneutical assumptions that mirror a complex web of factors ranging from the socioeconomic<br>

Yet the ultimate object of his desire, in these years when he indulges in theater and prays for chastity to come at some more convenient time, is neither theatrical nor narrowly sexual—nor is it God, who might have been the reader’s first suspicion. “I was in love with love,” Augustine writes, though he adds that he is a bit confused about what “love” might mean.<br>

This mixing of registers was not entirely unprecedented in the sixteenth century—for example, the French author Rabelais did the same—but its effect on public speech was.

However, Angela Moreno Acosta’s redrawing of one sequence from Gene Luen Yang’s American Born Chinese visualizes what has come to dominate the global image of manga, including Groensteen’s, namely the assumption that this kind of comics is particularly qualified for highlighting emotions, moods, and private interpersonal<br>

  Abstract: At least three different and influential theories of interpretation claim to be pragmatist. Knapp and Michaels’s theory is rigidly intentionalistic and author bound, while Richard Rorty’s contrastingly emphasizes the production of nonauthorial readings. The third, advanced by Stanley Fish, submits (and dissolves) both author and reader to the notion of the interpretive community as the authority determining the proper meaning of a text. In this essay I investigate two of these rival theories, examining them in the light of more general pragmatist principles. The purpose of this exercise is not to award a prize for the most authentically pragmatist theory<br>

  Abstract: This chapter discusses theological foundations for knowledge of God. Our approach emphasizes the conversion of the theologian and builds on previous chapters by illustrating how a theologian’s fourfold conversion determines the horizon within which discourse about God becomes meaningful.

In this way, the reader may gain a sense of how our discussion of foundations allows us to revisit classic themes or questions about God.<br>

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

Accordingly, the first chapter within this section offers a methodological guideline for how to do parable interpretation, which can be applied to every parable in early Christianity and beyond.

  Abstract: After the long, shifting account of Charles Péguy in Hill’s poem, what are we to take from him? What sense is to be made, for what will he, who ‘commends us to nothing’, serve? The concluding moment of the poem is when we expect summary, a considered gesture, at least the ceremony of closure even though it might resemble stiffened custom and a bellowing ‘with hoarse dignity into the wind’. Hill’s tone, directed at his own contemplation as well as that of the reader, concedes little. ‘Take that for example!’ mingles defiance, the clean blow, with surly dismissal.<br>

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  Book Title: Women’s writing in contemporary France-New writers, new literatures in the 1990s<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WORTON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The 1990s witnessed an explosion in women’s writing in France, with a particularly exciting new generation of writer’s coming to the fore, such as Christine Angot, Marie Darrieussecq and Regine Detambel. Other authors such as Paule Constant, Sylvie Germain, Marie Redonnet and Leila Sebbar, who had begun publishing in the 1980s, claimed their mainstream status in the 1990s with new texts. The book provides an up-to-date introduction to an analysis of new women’s writing in contemporary France, including both new writers of the 1990s and their more established counter-parts. The editors’ incisive introduction situates these authors and their texts at the centre of the current trends and issues concerning French literary production today, whilst fifteen original essays focus on individual writers. The volume includes specialist bibliographies on each writer, incorporating English translations, major interviews, and key critical studies. Quotations are given in both French and English throughout. An invaluable study resource, this book is written in a clear and accessible style and will be of interest to the general reader as well as to students of all levels, to teachers of a wide range of courses on French culture, and to specialist researchers of French and Francophone literature.<br>

Its primary focus on gender and body politics is provocatively inflected by Darrieussecq’s choice of narrator – a young woman who metamorphoses into a sow – and the novel reveals the author’s penchant for probing the frontiers between the everyday and the<br>

  Abstract: The terms ‘righteous’ and ‘righteousness’ do not occur in the book of Joshua and, after reading its stories of the conquest, one could be forgiven for concluding ‘with good reason’. To a modern reader the divine command to utterly destroy another nation smacks of ‘ ethnic cleansing’ or genocide. Nevertheless, if one takes the literary and theological context of the larger Hebrew Bible/Old Testament into account, as well as its ANE context, some appreciation can be gained of the presence of such stories and their contribution to the theology of divine righteousness.<br>

  Book Title: Luther and Liberation-A Latin American Perspective<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Altmann Walter<br>
  Abstract: With the approach of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s inauguration of the Protestant Reformation and the burgeoning dialogue between Catholics and Lutherans opened under Pope Francis, this new edition of Walter Altmann’s Luther and Liberation is timely and relevant. Luther and Liberation recovers the liberating and revolutionary impact of Luther’s theology, read afresh from the perspective of the Latin American context. Altmann provides a much-needed reassessment of Luther’s significance today through a direct engagement of Luther’s historical situation with an eye keenly situated on the deeply contextual situation of the contemporary reader, giving a localized reading from the author’s own experience in Latin America. The work examines with fresh vigor Luther’s central theological commitments, such as his doctrine of God, Christology, justification, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology, and his forays into economics, politics, education, violence, and war. This new edition greatly expands the original text with fresh scholarship and updated sources, footnotes, and bibliography, and contains several additional new chapters on Luther’s doctrine of God, theology of the sacraments, his controversial perspective on the Jews, and a new comparative account with the Latin American liberation theology tradition.<br>

The unorthodoxy of Wittgenstein emerges as much in his life as in his thought. For the reader unfamiliar with him, his writing<br>

  Book Title: Mexico in Verse-A History of Music, Rhyme, and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): BEEZLEY WILLIAM H.<br>
  Abstract: The history of Mexico is spoken in the voice of ordinary people. In rhymed verse and mariachi song, in letters of romance and whispered words in the cantina, the heart and soul of a nation is revealed in all its intimacy and authenticity.
      Mexico in Verse, edited by Stephen Neufeld and Michael Matthews, examines Mexican history through its poetry and music, the spoken and the written word.Focusing on modern Mexico, from 1840 to the 1980s, this volume examines the cultural venues in which people articulated their understanding of the social, political, and economic change they witnessed taking place during times of tremendous upheaval, such as the Mexican-American War, the Porfiriato, and the Mexican Revolution. The words of diverse peoples-people of the street, of the field, of the cantinas-reveal the development of the modern nation. Neufeld and Matthews have chosen sources so far unexplored by Mexicanist scholars in order to investigate the ways that individuals interpreted-whether resisting or reinforcing-official narratives about formative historical moments.The contributors offer new research that reveals how different social groups interpreted and understood the Mexican experience. The collected essays cover a wide range of topics: military life, railroad accidents, religious upheaval, children's literature, alcohol consumption, and the 1985 earthquake. Each chapter provides a translated song or poem that encourages readers to participate in the interpretive practice of historical research and cultural scholarship. In this regard,Mexico in Verseserves both as a volume of collected essays and as a classroom-ready primary document reader.<br>

  Book Title: Interrogating Cultural Studies-Theory, Politics and Practice<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Bowman Paul<br>
  Abstract: This book presents an original and innovative new approach to the field of cultural studies in the form of a series of dynamically executed interviews with some of the world’s leading and some of the most challenging emergent cultural theorists, from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond: Professor Mieke Bal, Professor Catherine Belsey, Professor Steven Connor, Professor Simon Critchley, Professor Thomas Docherty, Dr Jeremy Gilbert, Professor Sue Golding, Professor Lynette Hunter, Dr Martin McQuillan, Professor John Mowitt, Professor Christopher Norris, Professor Griselda Pollock, Professor Adrian Rifkin, Professor Jeremy Valentine, Professor Julian Wolfreys, and Professor Slavoj Zizek are all included here. The book is framed by lively and informative introductions, which introduce the work of these thinkers, and which also introduce the reader to the crucial importance of the issues that the interviews address. The result is an entertaining and hugely useful introduction to the key ideas in the field, the strengths and problematic weaknesses of cultural studies as a discipline, allowing the reader to chart its development, and to identify emerging trends. This book is ideal for students of cultural studies and the interdisciplinary arts and humanities, and will be of great interest to teachers and researchers working within a very wide range of areas of cultural studies.<br>

  Book Title: Forbidden Fictions-Pornography and Censorship in Twentieth-Century French Literature<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Phillips John<br>
  Abstract: ‘Phillips discusses texts by Apollinaire, Pierre Loüys, Georges Bataille, Pauline Réage, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Tony Duvert, Elizabeth Barillé and Marie Darrieussecq, engaging in different levels of critical analysis so as to emphasize intertextual and parodic elements in one case, or points of possible identification in another.’ TLS French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than its Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Forbidden Fictions is the first English-language study devoted exclusively to the wide spectrum of French literary pornography in the twentieth century. John Phillips provides a broad history of the genre and the associated moral and political issues. Among the texts examined in detail – all selected for their literary or sociopolitical importance – are landmark works by Apollinaire, Louÿs, Bataille, Réage, Robbe-Grillet, Arsan, and Duvert. Phillips challenges current politically correct trends in literary criticism and stereotyped censoring discourses about pornography to provide a new reading of each text and to illustrate the genre’s potential for social subversion. Forbidden Fictions addresses the most controversial issues of contemporary sexual politics, such as objectification, sadomasochism, homoeroticism and paedophilia, with particular emphasis on the feminist debate on pornography. In the light of current controversy over the control of pornography, this is a timely and scholarly review of the ethical, moral and social arguments surrounding the censorship of sexually explicit material.<br>

At the same time, the 1950s had seen the illicit and usually anonymous publication of many new erotic novels. In particular, Pauline Réage’sHistoire d’O(1954), Vladimir Nabokov’sLolita(1955) and Jean de Berg’sL’Image(1956); all of these, in their different ways, had prepared the ‘cultured’ French reader for the more explicit<br>

Davis’s ambitious itinerary took in Edinburgh, Abbotsford (Scott’s estate), Dryburgh Abbey (the site of Scott’s tomb), the Trossachs (including Rob Roy’s grave), Glasgow, Oban, the Isle of Mull, Fort William, and, finally, Inverness and Culloden. Davis had been an ardent reader of Scott since his boyhood, and much of the tour amounted to a pilgrimage to honor the most beloved author among the planter class in the antebellum American South.¹ But<br>

  Abstract: In

Hillis Miller begins with a fable of reading, a fable in which the reader, although presumably following a (straight) line, is continually sidetracked, led off course, and thus forced into labyrinthine byways. How did the reader get into this trap? He thought he was reading a story, but he finds he is that story and can’t get out: “These blind alleys in the analysis of narrative may not by any means be avoided. They may only be veiled by some credulity making a standing place where there is an abyss” (23).<br>

  Abstract: MACHIAVELLI scandalized his Renaissance reader not because he advised the prince to use force and fraud but because he refused to cloak his advice in the rhetoric of scholastic or Christian humanist idealism. Instead, he insisted that the prince acts in a world in which there are “no prefigured meanings, no implicit teleology,”¹ in which order and legibility are the products of human action rather than the a priori objects of human cognition. To recognize this, he argued, is to acknowledge the truth of power, as opposed to an idealistic notion of truth conceived in terms of representation, as correspondence<br>

Its most sophisticated device is to posit my invention of a “naive reader” and to suggest that I would place the New Critics and their heirs in that category. But when I see the movement of criticism after Arnold as exhibiting an anti-self-consciousness principle or being so worried about a hypertrophy of the critical spirit that that spirit is acknowledged only by refusing it seminal or creative force, I am not alleging naivete but “organized innocence,” or the privileged assignment of some given, intuitive (in that sense<br>

  Book Title: Atheism for Beginners-A Coursebook for Schools and Colleges<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘atheism’ is derived from the Greek: a meaning ‘not’ is conjoined with theos meaning ‘god’. So atheism may be defined as follows: it is the belief that there is no God. Unfortunately definition of terms is rarely this straightforward. In this educational book, Michael Palmer undertakes to analyse, develop and discuss the complex and too often reduced notion of atheism. In spite of the consciously atheist point of view adopted by the author, the volume remains critical and objective, making religious, philosophical and political concepts around atheism understandable. Even though the book clearly addresses a young audience, any kind of reader will find food for thought in this vivid and detailed work.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we looked at NT books composed in a basic narrative framework: the four Gospels and Acts. Although they include large amounts of direct discourse, such as sayings, speeches, and dialogues, the Gospels and Acts mostly contain narrative materials (e.g., miracle stories and historical legends). Also, the direct discourse in these books is joined by narrative comments and summary statements that permeate each work. The epistolary literature is primarily direct discourse. Its small amount of narrative material is mostly autobiographical. Much of its hymns, sayings, and teaching material is part of a dialogue between author and reader.<br>

Instead, it is a dynamic history of the divine acts of God that can be seen throughout the canonizing process as successive generations interpreted the tradition and text for their situations.

  Abstract: Grace for the Injured Self shows the reader how the 'self psychology' developed by Heinz Kohut can be an influential theory for pastoral care. The late Kohut affirmed that religion is not only an expression of the self, but can also sustain the self in the alliance between faith and grace, with self psychology and empathy. Cooper and Randall articulately explore Kohut's psychoanalytic perspective of 'self psychology', orientated towards pastoral care for parishioners. The authors ascertain how the human condition is affected by 'self injury', and the relationship between this and the traditional notions of sin. Two interviews with Kohut, never before published in the UK, give the reader unique insights into the psychoanalyst who many regard as the most important figure in psychology since Sigmund Freud.<br>

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

  Book Title: Translating the English Bible-From Relevance to Deconstruction<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

Within the context of reader response theory this paper explores the narrative layering in the novels of Timothy Findley and the structuring of texts that consciously anticipate the role of the reader. Implicit in this reading of Findley’s work is a tripartite model of reader response theory that includes a self-consciously constructing writer, a self-referentially deconstructing reader, and the enigmatic text of their mutual exchange.

  Abstract: Stendhal’s irony is more radical than Jane Austen’s. His characters tend to be unstable compounds, and they demand a shifting and flexible response from the reader. That response is enacted for us by the narrator, who regards his hero from constantly varying distances and directions. Stendhal’s rhetoric recalls, in its shifts and dodges, the example of Byron’s
                  Don Juan. That poem, like Stendhal’s novels, is a work of an age of reaction and political repression, of institutionalized banality. Behind both lie the French Revolution and the remarkable career of Napoleon. The vitality of the revolution and of the young Napoleon<br>

  Book Title: The Postmodern Bible-The Bible and Culture Collective<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wuellner Wilhelm<br>
  Abstract: The burgeoning use of modern literary theory and cultural criticism in recent biblical studies has led to stimulating-but often bewildering-new readings of the Bible. This book, argued from a perspective shaped by postmodernism, is at once an accessible guide to and an engagement with various methods, theories, and critical practices transforming biblical scholarship today.Written by a collective of cutting-edge scholars-with each page the work of multiple hands-
      The Postmodern Bibledeliberately breaks with the individualist model of authorship that has traditionally dominated scholarship in the humanities and is itself an illustration of the postmodern transformation of biblical studies for which it argues.The book introduces, illustrates, and critiques seven prominent strategies of reading. Several of these interpretive strategies-rhetorical criticism, structuralism and narratology, reader-response criticism, and feminist criticism-have been instrumental in the transformation of biblical studies up to now. Many-feminist and womanist criticism, ideological criticism, poststructuralism, and psychoanalytic criticism-hold promise for the continued transformation of these studies in the future. Focusing on readings from both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, this volume illuminates the current multidisciplinary debates emerging from postmodernism by exposing the still highly contested epistemological, political, and ethical positions in the field of biblical studies.<br>

  Abstract: Along with reader-response criticism, structuralist and narratological criticism has offered biblical interpreters a crucial entryway into literary theory and the reading of the Bible. The theoretical models and language associated with structuralism and narratology, however, are quite distinct. Readers unfamiliar with these approaches may find the technical terminology complex and confusing. For this reason we concentrate our discussion on five key terms:
                  structuralism, formalism, semiotics, narratology, andpoetics. Their interrelations will be dealt with along the way. Suffice it to say here, by way of explaining the chapter title, that formalism and semiotics will be taken up in relation to<br>

  Book Title: Firewalking and Religious Healing-The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Danforth Loring M.<br>
  Abstract: "If the Saint calls you, if you have an open road, then you don't feel the fire as if it were your enemy," says one of the participants in the Anastenaria. This compelling work evokes and contrasts two forms of firewalking and religious healing: first, the Anastenaria, a northern Greek ritual in which people who are possessed by Saint Constantine dance dramatically over red-hot coals, and, second, American firewalking, one of the more spectacular activities of New Age psychology. Loring Danforth not only analyzes these rituals in light of the most recent work in medical and symbolic anthropology but also describes in detail the lives of individual firewalkers, involving the reader personally in their experiences: he views ritual therapy as a process of transformation and empowerment through which people are metaphorically moved from a state of illness to a state of health. Danforth shows that the Anastenaria and the songs accompanying it allow people to express and resolve conflict-laden family relationships that may lead to certain kinds of illnesses. He also demonstrates how women use the ritual to gain a sense of power and control over their lives without actually challenging the ideology of male dominance that pervades Greek culture. Comparing the Anastenaria with American firewalking, Danforth includes a gripping account of his own participation in a firewalk in rural Maine. Finally he examines the place of anthropology in a postmodern world in which the boundaries between cultures are becoming increasingly blurred.<br>

This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible i~<br>

  Book Title: A Poetics of Unnatural Narrative-  Publisher: Ohio State University Press<br>
  Author(s): RICHARDSON BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: A Poetics of Unnatural Narrativeoffers a collection of foundational essays introducing the reader to the full scope of unnatural narrative theory: its meaning, its goals, its extent, its paradoxes. This volume brings together a distinguished group of international critics, scholars, and historians that includes several of the world's leading narrative theorists. Together, they survey many basic areas of narrative studies from an unnatural perspective: story, time, space, voice, minds, narrative levels, "realism," nonfiction, hyperfiction, and narrative poetry. Rarely have these fundamental concepts been subjected to such an original and thoroughgoing reconceptualization. Much of the book is directed toward an investigation of experimental and antirealist work. Each essay focuses on texts and episodes that narrative theory has tended to neglect, and each provides theoretical formulations that are commensurate with such exceptional, albeit neglected, works.A Poetics of Unnatural Narrativearticulates and delineates the newest and most radical movement in narrative studies. This anthology will be of great interest to students and scholars of narrative studies and of the history and theory of modern fiction.<br>

  Book Title: Sin and Evil-Moral Values in Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PAULSON RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The confusion of sin and evil, or religious and moral transgression, is the subject of Ronald Paulson's latest book. He calls attention to the important distinction between sin and Evil (with a capital E) that in our times is largely ignored, and to the further confusion caused by the term "moral values." Ranging widely through the history of Western literature, Paulson focuses particularly on American and English works of the eighteenth through twentieth centuries to discover how questions of evil and sin-and evil and sinful behavior-have been discussed and represented.The breadth of Paulson's discussion is enormous, taking the reader from Greek and Roman tragedy, to Christian satire in the work of Swift and Hogarth, to Hawthorne's and Melville's novels, and finally to twentieth-century studies of good and evil by such authors as James, Conrad, Faulkner, Greene, Heller, Vonnegut, and O'Brien. Where does evil come from? What are "moral values"? If evil is a cultural construct, what does that imply? Paulson's literary tour of sin and evil over the past two hundred years provides not only a historical perspective but also new ways of thinking about important issues that characterize our own era of violence, intolerance, and war.<br>

  Book Title: Who Was Jacques Derrida?-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): MIKICS DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Who Was Jacques Derrida?is the first intellectual biography of Derrida, the first full-scale appraisal of his career, his influence, and his philosophical roots. It is also the first attempt to define his crucial importance as the ambassador of "theory," the phenomenon that has had a profound influence on academic life in the humanities. Mikics lucidly and sensitively describes for the general reader Derrida's deep connection to his Jewish roots. He succinctly defines his vision of philosophy as a discipline that resists psychology. While pointing out the flaws of that vision and Derrida's betrayal of his most adamantly expounded beliefs, Mikics ultimately concludes that "Derrida was neither so brilliantly right nor so badly wrong as his enthusiasts and critics, respectively, claimed."<br>

  Abstract: Walking has played a fundamental role in all animal species throughout evolution. When aquatic life gave way to terrestrial life, a whole set of problems had to be resolved, beginning with integrating the four elements of walking: posture, locomotor rhythm, gaze, and gesture. To the reader who might think that we are about to launch into a question of restricted and basic motor physiology, that is, far removed from cognitive function, I would say that posture is none other than “preparation to act,”¹ and locomotion is not only about making successive steps but also navigating in space.

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  Abstract: In this completely revised edition of one of the foundational texts of network sociology, Harrison White refines and enlarges his groundbreaking theory of how social structure and culture emerge from the chaos and uncertainty of social life. Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro,
      Identity and Controlpresents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

  Book Title: Transmitters and Creators-Chinese Commentators and Commentaries on the Analects<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Makeham John<br>
  Abstract: The Analects (Lunyu) is one of the most influential texts in human history. As a putative record of Confucius’s (551–479 B.C.E.) teachings and a foundational text in scriptural Confucianism, this classic was instrumental in shaping intellectual traditions in China and East Asia until the early twentieth century. But no premodern reader read only the text of the Analects itself. Rather, the Analects was embedded in a web of interpretation that mediated its meaning. Modern interpreters of the Analects only rarely acknowledge this legacy of two thousand years of commentaries. How well do we understand prominent or key commentaries from this tradition? How often do we read such commentaries as we might read the text on which they comment? Many commentaries do more than simply comment on a text. Not only do they shape the reading of the text, but passages of text serve as pretexts for the commentator to develop and expound his own body of thought. This book attempts to redress our neglect of commentaries by analyzing four key works dating from the late second century to the mid-nineteenth century (a period substantially contemporaneous with the rise and decline of scriptural Confucianism): the commentaries of He Yan (ca. 190–249); Huang Kan (488–545); Zhu Xi (1130–1200); and Liu Baonan (1791–1855) and Liu Gongmian (1821–1880).<br>

  Abstract: One is to write one’s first sentence in such a way that the reader will want, without fail, to read the second sentence. So reads the advice that William Faulkner imparted to anyone who wishes to embark on the adventure of writing a text. Truthfully, this is no easy demand to fulfill, especially if one considers that—regarded from outside—at first something entirely arbitrary belongs to every beginning. And if it is adequate to satisfy the Faulknerian precept, it thus remains that such a beginning in every case possesses something compelling or seductive, though not compulsory in the strict<br>

  Book Title: Novelas españolas ambientadas en Italia-Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar; Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez<br>
  Publisher: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca<br>
  Author(s): SANTOS M.ª ALMUDENA MATEOS<br>
  Abstract: Las fuentes en las que se fundamenta la novela histórica proporcionan, además de una ambientación correcta de la acción, la veracidad necesaria para que el lector reconozca el trabajo llevado a cabo por el autor. Este estudio se centra en descubrir las fuentes históricas, literarias, artísticas, religiosas y culturales de dos novelas muy diferentes que comparten un marco común, el Renacimiento Italiano. Mientras que en Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar (1877-1879) la exactitud histórica se presenta sólo en determinados capítulos que parecen ralentizar la acción, en Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), lo histórico está tan integrado que es difícil detectar qué parte se corresponde con la historia y cuál con la ficción. Las fuentes consultadas por los autores e incorporadas al texto narrativo proporcionan laexhaustividad necesaria para que el ambiente histórico recreado sea preciso. Al confrontar dichas fuentes con el texto literario se observa cómo, además, el marco creado ayuda a delimitarla psicología de los protagonistas, pues, aunque son personajes históricos, los autores crean una vida de ficción a partir de los hechos históricos. Por otro lado, las referencias literarias (correspondientes a un periodo que va desde los siglos XV y XVI hasta el presente de los autores) aportan el marco necesario para que los protagonistas sean portadores de una nueva inmortalidad. La exactitud de las descripciones, la configuración de los caracteres tanto renacentistas como contemporáneos, las perspectivas artísticas o religiosas, configuran estas dos obras en una serie de coincidencias difíciles de obviar.The sources, which the historical novel is based on, provide the correct setting of the action and the necessary truthfulness for the reader to recognise the work carried out by the author.

Claude Bruaire’s originality is not impaired by the wealth of philosophical and theological sources from which he weaves his reflection on being-as-spirit-and-as-gift.

  Abstract: Throughout this book, we have been employing a notion of the performative that the work we have done enables us to further clarify. Unlike Austin, we have not assumed that a particular linguistic formulation can itself perform a specific action or determine a certain interpretation. We do not wish to imply that the language of the poems of Hopkins and Eliot, in and of itself, makes our (or anyone else’s) readings happen. Our interest has been, rather, in situating whatever transpires in the middle ground between poem and reader. Thus, our notion of the performative has more in common with<br>

  Book Title: Mirages and Mad Beliefs-Proust the Skeptic<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Prendergast Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Proust was long the object of a cult in which the main point of reading his great novel
      In Search of Lost Timewas to find, with its narrator, a redemptive epiphany in a pastry and a cup of lime-blossom tea. We now live in less confident times, in ways that place great strain on the assumptions and beliefs that made those earlier readings possible. This has led to a new manner of reading Proust, against the grain. InMirages and Mad Beliefs, Christopher Prendergast argues the case differently, with the grain, on the basis that Proust himself was prey to self-doubt and found numerous, if indirect, ways of letting us know. Prendergast traces in detail the locations and forms of a quietly nondogmatic yet insistently skeptical voice that questions the redemptive aesthetic the novel is so often taken to celebrate, bringing the reader to wonder whether that aesthetic is but another instance of the mirage or the mad belief that, in other guises, figures prominently inIn Search of Lost Time. In tracing the modalities of this self-pressuring voice, Prendergast ranges far and wide, across a multiplicity of ideas, themes, sources, and stylistic registers in Proust's literary thought and writing practice, attentive at every point to inflections of detail, in a sustained account of Proust the skeptic for the contemporary reader.<br>

The difficulty of the work is increased in the case of temporal or spatial distance: when the reader wishes to understand a text from another age or in a different language.

That imagined place and time is characterized essentially by “advancements” in science that plausibly explore the consequences of what is now known and actively researched (in such areas as artificial intelligence, genetic manipulation, space travel, pharmacology, and so forth).

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Did Freud present a scientific hypothesis about the unconscious, as he always maintained and as many of his disciples keep repeating? This question has long prompted debates concerning the legitimacy and usefulness of psychoanalysis, and it is of utmost importance to Lacanian analysts, whose main project has been to stress Freud's scientific grounding. Here Jacques Bouveresse, a noted authority on Ludwig Wittgenstein, contributes to the debate by turning to this Austrian-born philosopher and contemporary of Freud for a candid assessment of the early issues surrounding psychoanalysis. Wittgenstein, who himself had delivered a devastating critique of traditional philosophy, sympathetically pondered Freud's claim to have produced a scientific theory in proposing a new model of the human psyche. What Wittgenstein recognized--and what Bouveresse so eloquently stresses for today's reader--is that psychoanalysis does not aim to produce a change limited to the intellect but rather seeks to provoke an authentic change of human attitudes. The beauty behind the theory of the unconscious for Wittgenstein is that it breaks away from scientific, causal explanations to offer new forms of thinking and speaking, or rather, a new mythology.<br>

  Abstract: The semiotic study of a literary text is not wholly unlike traditional interpretation or rhetorical analysis, nor is it meant to replace these other modes of response to literary works. But the semiotic critic situates the text somewhat differently, privileges different dimensions of the text, and uses a critical methodology adpated to the semiotic enterprise. Most interpretive methods privilege the “meaning” of the text. Hermeneutic critics seek authorial or intentional meaning; the New Critics seek the ambiguities of “textual” meaning; the “reader response” critics allow readers to make meaning. With respect to meaning the semiotic critic is situated differently. Such<br>

As these strategies come into play in the trilogy’s final volume, the trail leads neither toward nor away from a corpse, but instead into postmodern meditations on subjectivity, sexuality, sublimity, and silence.

  Book Title: Detecting Texts-The Metaphysical Detective Story from Poe to Postmodernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Susan Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to
      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

Adorno later linked his misgivings about poetry after the Holocaust to his objection to the aesthetic pleasure the reader (or spectator) experiences upon contemplating works of art that portray physical suffering: “the so-called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people being beaten to the ground by rifle-butts contains, however remotely, the power to elicit<br>

  Abstract: Translations of sacred texts have often been accompanied by metatexts, which function to guide the reader in interpreting the text. The King James Version as it was originally published in 1611 included various kinds of metatexts. This paper examines three metatexts—two metatexts consisting of the two prefaces found in the preliminaries, and the set of marginal notes accompanying the translation. One preface was a three-page dedication to the king. A second, eleven-page preface to the translation articulated the aims and goals of the translators with great clarity.

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

  The Modiano Novel from:

  Abstract: We have now seen numerous instances of Modiano at his most subversive. The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be postmodern subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

  Abstract: This chapter situates the subject of fiction, and the subject as writer of fiction, simultaneously. Between the two, a third emerges – the subject as critic – offering the reader a triple reading of a triple writing. It is a moment whereby to trace the trace, to trace the historical trajectory of a historical trajectory, requires that both the subject of the fiction and the subject as writer of fiction lay themselves bare on the page – reveal everything – and the critic binds and unwinds, untying the strings of history at different threads, unraveling the hidden, the forbidden, and the repressed that lie<br>

While Muldoon’s intrusive literary allusions demand the reader’s attention, his poetry would remain opaque and open to the charge of pretentiousness if their functions and effects were not properly understood. The same is not true of McGuckian’s poetry: unaware of its true dialogism, the reader is likely to detect only disembodied voices.

On the face of it, the matter seems rather trivial: when the participants in the dialogue are unknown to the reader, they are to be mentioned by name and/or title, for the sake of clarity; but when it is clear whose move it is, no explicit indication is necessary.

  Abstract: Tolstoy’s early stories use misdirection, diversion, in order to create the experience of real presentness for the reader, who, happily distracted, passes into a world of fiction perhaps without realizing it. The late stories, on the contrary, often feign the simplicity of pure readerly experience, while alienating that experience through complex narrative structures. In the former, Tolstoy struggles against the alibi of narrative, continually collapsing the distance between “elsewhere” and the present “here.” In the latter, however, Tolstoy raises a narrative barrier to purely present meaning; and though his stories often contain what should be a simple moral meaning, they<br>

  Book Title: On Diary-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DURNIN KATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: On Diary is the second collection in English of the groundbreaking and profoundly influential work of one of the best-known and provocative theorists of autobiography and diary. Ranging from the diary’s historical origins to its pervasive presence on the Internet, from the spiritual journey of the sixteenth century to the diary of Anne Frank, and from the materials and methods of diary writing to the question of how diaries end, these essays display Philippe Lejeune’s expertise, eloquence, passion, and humor as a commentator on the functions, practices, and significance of keeping or reading a diary. Lejeune is a leading European critic and theorist of diary and autobiography. His landmark essay, "The Autobiographical Pact," has shaped life writing studies for more than thirty years, and his many books and essays have repeatedly opened up new vistas for scholarship. As Michael Riffaterre notes, "Lejeune’s work on autobiography is the most original, powerful, effective approach to a difficult subject. . . . His style is very personal, lively. It grabs the reader as scholarship rarely does. Lejeune’s erudition and methodology are impeccable." Two substantial introductory essays by Jeremy Popkin and Julie Rak place Lejeune’s work within its critical and theoretical traditions and comment on his central importance within the fields of life writing, literary genetic studies, and cultural studies.<br>

  Abstract: Given its affinity with questions of identity, autobiography offers a way into the interior space between author and reader, especially when writers define themselves in terms of religion. In his exploration of this "textual intimacy," Wesley Kort begins with a theorization of what it means to say who one is and how one's self-account as a religious person stands in relation to other forms of self-identification. He then provides a critical analysis of autobiographical texts by nine contemporary American writers-including Maya Angelou, Philip Roth, and Anne Lamott-who give religion a positive place in their accounts of who they are. Finally, in disclosing his own religious identity, Kort concludes with a meditation on several meanings of the word

  Abstract: It is often assumed that the law and religion address different spheres of human life. Religion and ethics articulate complex systems of moral reasoning that concern norms, deliberation of ends, cultivation of disposition, and transformation of moral agency. Law, in contrast, seeks to govern human conduct through procedural justice, rights, and public good. Doing Justice to Mercy challenges this assumption by presenting the reader with an urgent conversation between the law and religion that yields a constructive approach, both theoretically and practically, to the complex role of mercy in our legal process.<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): BAROLINI TEODOLINDA<br>
  Abstract: Accepting Dante's prophetic truth claims on their own terms, Teodolinda Barolini proposes a "detheologized" reading as a global new approach to the
      Divine Comedy. Not aimed at excising theological concerns from Dante, this approach instead attempts to break out of the hermeneutic guidelines that Dante structured into his poem and that have resulted in theologized readings whose outcomes have been overdetermined by the poet. By detheologizing, the reader can emerge from this poet's hall of mirrors and discover the narrative techniques that enabled Dante to forge a true fiction. Foregrounding the formal exigencies that Dante masked as ideology, Barolini moves from the problems of beginning to those of closure, focusing always on the narrative journey. Her investigation--which treats such topics as the visionary and the poet, the One and the many, narrative and time--reveals some of the transgressive paths trodden by a master of mimesis, some of the ways in which Dante's poetic adventuring is indeed, according to his own lights, Ulyssean.<br>

The author promotes a transnational and heterogeneous feminism, which, she maintains, can replace the proliferation of feminisms based on difference. She argues for a feminist geopolitical literacy that goes beyond fundamentalist identity politics and absolutist poststructuralist theory, and she continually focuses the reader's attention on those locations where differences are negotiated and transformed.<br>

He analyses the poetics or mythological underpinning of the works and investigates the cultural significance of the tropes that typify their works.

At the same time the reader learns that the murder of an unknown girl has taken place, a murder that is never resolved but that serves as a warning against all unknown “prowlers.” YetThe Prowleris also, indeed mostly, about love as what Gunnars’ narrator names that “vulnerable territory”<br>

  Book Title: Poetics of Reading-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMMERS INGE CROSMAN<br>
  Abstract: What happens when we read novels and how do we make sense of them? Inge Wimmers explores these questions by developing a flexible poetics of reading that generously opens up the interpretive space between reader and text, while drawing on current theories of reading and combining rhetorical, pragmatic, and phenomenological approaches. "Poetics," here, is extended beyond the study of purely textual features to structures of exchange between text and reader. In a discussion of four major French novels from the seventeenth century to the present, the author not only sets up a broad-based poetics but also makes important contributions to contemporary issues in the study of narrative. Wimmers introduces the concept of multiple, interlocking frames of reference that allows for the integration of diverse critical perspectives. Analyzing La Princesse de Cleves, Madame Bovary, A la recherche du temps perdu, and Projet pour une revolution a New York, she shows how texts provide some frames of reference, while others are produced by the reader's disposition and cultural milieu.<br>

Readings differ depending on the kind of novel being read and the reader’s purpose, interests, and ideology. By opening the interpretive space between reader and text to include both text interpretation and self-interpretation, the frames of reference that come into play are multiplied. Moreover, the emphasis in recent theories of reading on emotional response—in particular the enjoyment readers get from taking an active part—opens up new directions for a<br>

  Abstract: A reader may be in" a text as a character is in a novel, but also as one is in a train of thought--both possessing and being possessed by it. This paradox suggests the ambiguities inherent in the concept of audience.

The scene has changed, but the critical orientation represented by these “movements” has not disappeared. Rather it has been sublimated and to an extent transformed in the “ideology critique” that dominates literary studies at this moment. The most enduring effect of deconstruction has been the subversion of all universalist or foundationalist claims to truth. In the Marxist canon, ideology has as one of its principal meanings “false consciousness,” which is a kind of universalizing thought that conceals the particular, self-interested (class) motives that<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

Aphorisms deployed along with another genre serve both as a component of the overall text and as text in and of themselves. Given their differentiated identity, aphorisms display idiosyncratic powers of evocation peculiar to the genre. Because of its peculiar behaviour in relation to the narrated chain of events, aphorism often demands the reader’s focused attention.

  Book Title: The Future of the Word-An Eschatology of Reading<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

  Book Title: Stardom in Postwar France-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Holmes Diana<br>
  Abstract: The 1950s and 1960s were a key moment in the development of postwar France. The period was one of rapid change, derived from post-World War II economic and social modernization; yet many traditional characteristics were retained. By analyzing the eruption of the new postwar world in the context of a France that was both modern and traditional, we can see how these worlds met and interacted, and how they set the scene for the turbulent 1960s and 70s. The examination of the development of mass culture in post-war France, undertaken in this volume, offers a valuable insight into the shifts that took place. By exploring stardom from the domain of cinema and other fields, represented here by famous figures such as Brigitte Bardot, Johnny Hallyday or Jean-Luc Godard, and less conventionally treated areas of enquiry (politics [de Gaulle], literary [Francoise Sagan], and intellectual culture [Levi-Strauss]) the reader is provided with a broad understanding of the mechanisms of popularity and success, and their cultural, social, and political roles. The picture that emerges shows that many cultural articulations remained or became identifiably "French," in spite of the American mass-culture origins of these social, economic, and cultural transformations.<br>

This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: Having addressed the literary composition and historical-situation features of the Johannine Epistles, their theological and ethical content becomes more readily accessible and understandable. In addition to an adequate understanding of their composition and context helping the reader get the content right, however, misconstruing such features may impede one’s adequate understanding of their message, so a good deal of modesty is required in any approach to the Johannine Epistles, as one must remind oneself that evidence can sometimes be seen as pointing in more than one direction.<br>

The intertextuality¹ in question is of a very special kind since no texts by other writers are concerned.

In this poem, short lines and an emphatic but unpredictable use of rhyme and off-rhyme keep the poem and reader on their toes, following the twists and turns of a poem that feels its way forward.

  Abstract: Reading the philosophy of Quentin Meillassoux gives one an appreciation of what it must be like to ride a donkey in a state of inebriation: in the attempt not to fall off on one side it is very easy to find oneself sliding down the other. It is easy to think, on the one hand, that Meillassoux’s arguments are all spectacular, unheard-of and revolutionary, or to assume, on the other hand, that he is playing a game with his reader, and cannot possibly mean what he says in earnest.

  Abstract: In this chapter I want to consider the import of a political speech in the context of the relation between the ethical and the political, the spiritual and the material. To do this I want to play off the historical moment and its surrounding contextual discourses with the speech’s invocation of a transhistorical and universal set of values. New Historicism evolved in the 1980s as in some ways a reaction to structuralism and formalism. Indebted to political, poststructuralist and reader-response theory, it has focused on the intertextuality of literary and non-literary texts and the presence of diverse culturally specific discourses<br>

Although the two nations are treated separately in each chapter in order to highlight individual particularities, comparative allusions are made in order to illustrate the ways Brazil and Portugal impinge upon each other’s respective national identity formation. Before embarking on the literary and philosophical discussions that will occupy all subsequent chapters (chapters 3 through 5), discussions that emphasize the notion of the weakening of the nationstate and its correlative myths or utopias<br>

  Abstract: Marco Denevi is one of Argentina’s most influential and important prose writers. One of the most distinctive features of his writing is the creation of a situation in which a presumed truth has been concealed with a mask. Consequently, in Denevi’s work there always seems to be an uneasy tension, a nagging suspicion that something is definitely not what it appears to be. As the reader proceeds through the narration, the numerous false facades that hide the unexpected and sometimes shocking truth lying underneath are slowly chipped away. Denevi’s numerous

He wanted to listen to their songs and use the lyrics to challenge the official, and quite abject, version of their story.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Scheible Kristin<br>
  Abstract: Reading the Mahavamsaadvocates a new, literary approach to this text by revealing its embedded reading advice (to experiencesamvegaandpasada) and affective work of metaphors (the Buddha's dharma as light) and salient characters (nagas). Kristin Scheible argues that theMahavamsarequires a particular kind of reading. In the text's proem, special instructions draw readers to the metaphor of light and thenagas, or salient snake-beings, of the first chapter.Nagasare both model worshippers and unworthy hoarders of Buddha's relics. As nonhuman agents, they challenge political and historicist readings of the text. Scheible sees these slippery characters and the narrative's potent and playful metaphors as techniques for refocusing the reader's attention on the text's emotional aims. Her work explains theMahavamsa's central motivational role in contemporary Sri Lankan Buddhist and nationalist circles. It also speaks broadly to strategies of reading religious texts and to the internal and external cues that give such works lives beyond the page.<br>

Moreover, our understanding of happiness is indubitably in large part the one produced by the eighteenth century.

  Author(s): Weiss Julian<br>
  Abstract: Professor Alan Deyermond was one of the leading British Hispanists of the last fifty years, whose work had a formative influence on medieval Hispanic studies around the world. There were several tributes to his work published during his lifetime, and it is fitting that this one, in his memory, should be produced by Tamesis, the publishing house that he helped establish and to which he contributed so much as author and editor right up to his death. The contributors to this volume are some of Professor Deyermond's former colleagues, doctoral students, and members of the Medieval Hispanic Research Seminar. Given Professor Deyermond's breadth of expertise, the span of the essays is appropriately wide, ranging chronologically from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, and covering lyric, hagiography, clerical verse narrative, frontier balladry, historical and codicological studies. The volume opens with a personal memoir of her father by Ruth Deyermond, and closes with the draft of an unpublished essay found amongst Professor Deyermond's papers, and edited by his literary executor, Professor David Hook. Andrew M. Beresford is Reader and Head of Hispanic Studies at the University of Durham. Louise M. Haywood is Reader in Medieval Iberian Literary and Cultural Studies, and Head of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Cambridge.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas.

El análisis detallado de una decena de películas argentinas de la post-dictadura dirigidas entre 1983 y 2008, incluyendo tanto clásicas (La historia oficial, Un lugar en el mundo) como olvidadas (Amigomio, El rigor del destino), revela cómo la mirada y el lenguaje del niño son puestos al servicio de una alegoría nostálgica, estructurada en torno a la memoria o al lenguaje verbal y vinculada a la figura del padre ausente. Dufays combina los análisis fílmicos con una amplia reflexión teórica sobre las cuatro nociones clave de alegoría, melancolía, nostalgia y duelo y los articula con una genealogía de la figura alegórica del niño en las tradiciones narrativas latinoamericanas. Este recorrido permite al lector explorar las significaciones simbólicas y discursivas que el personaje infantil, la infancia y la familia han adquirido en el cine y en el contexto postdictatorial argentino. Sophie Dufays es investigadora postdoctoral del Fondo Nacional de Investigación Científica de Bélgica, en la Universidad de Louvain-la-Neuve. This book is the first monograph devoted to the role of the child in Latin American cinema. Through close analysis of about ten Argentine fiction films of the post-dictatorship period directed between 1983 and 2008, including both classic such as The Official Story and A Place in the World) and forgotten works such as Amigomío and El rigor del destino. Dufays shows how the child's gaze and language are a means of focusing a nostalgic form of allegory, structured around either memory or verbal language, and related to the figure of the absent father. In combining these analyses with a wide theoretical articulation of four key notions (allegory, melancholy, mourning and nostalgia) and with a genealogy of the allegorical child character in Latin American narrative traditions, Relatos de infancia allows the reader to explore the meanings that childhood and fa~<br>

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Book Title: Charles d'Orléans in England, 1415-1440-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Arn Mary-Jo<br>
  Abstract: Charles, duc d'Orléans, prince and poet, was a captive in England for twenty-five years following the battle of Agincourt. The studies in this volume, by European and American scholars, focus on his life and actions during that time, and show him as a serious and learned reader, a cunning political figure (accomplished in the skills that would impress the English nobility around him), and a masterful poet, innovative, witty, and intensely self-aware. Discussion of his manuscripts, his social and political relationships, his extensive library, and his poetry in two languages reveal him as a shrewd observer of life, which in his poetry he describes in ways not seen again until the Renaissance.

  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: This anthology of ten essays framed by an introduction and annotated bibliography (1500–1700) might be read as a protest book: scholars from a wide range of disciplines but all with historical focus insist that tolerance had more than liberal origins, in effect refuting “that John Locke invented toleration and that John Stuart Mill perfected it” (p. x). The subtitle, invoking a fifteenth‐century plea for tolerance, may mislead if “rites” implies liturgy. Rather, these essays offer voices of toleration in unexpected places: Cyrus of Persia, a medieval Chinese culture so hospitable to Jews that they were absorbed and disappeared, theologians pleading for tolerance toward American Indians in sixteenth‐century Spain, for acceptance of Muslims in Renaissance England, and for forbearance if not for religious liberty in pre‐Enlightenment Europe. For ethics the two most helpful entries are the editor’s clarification of the concepts and shadings of tolerance, both contemporary and historical, and a splendid essay by Sammy Basu on humor and toleration, “Woe unto you that laugh now!” Scholarly in tone, extensive in endnotes, authors assume that one can only understand the nature of texts advocating tolerance in their historical contexts. While these essays mostly look to religious protests against oppression and intolerance, the reader may well conclude that the Enlightenment was not misnamed.<br>

Abstract: In terms of the most recent developments this article describes, whether because of modesty or disingenuousness Duranti underemphasizes the important role he himself has played in consolidating the fields third paradigm. He has been steadily redefining linguistic anthropology for some time now through his various publications, including most notably the excellent textbook
         Linguistic Anthropology(1997) and the readersLinguistic Anthropology: A Reader(2001b) andKey Terms in Language and Culture(2001). As part of the debate that this article will inevitably trigger, we might consider what is at stake (politically, intellectually, personally) in this redefinition of one of anthropologys four subfields. As someone very much in favor of many of the trends Duranti notes in the third paradigm, I would nevertheless like to see at least some attention given to how and by whom linguistic anthropology is redefined and/or consolidated and how and by whom a new canon is constructed, if indeed that is what is happening.c<br>

Abstract: In other words, to answer the question “Who?” is to tell the story of a life. The subject, Ricoeur suggests, is both author and reader of its own life. And the story of that life is continuously reconfigured. The permanence of the proper name as narrative identity, unlike the abstract identity of the same (
      idem), thus includes change within continuity. This notion of narrative identity is not applicable only to individuals but also to groups, which in similar ways constitute their identity by taking up narratives that become, for them, their real history. The story of a group is constituted in time by a series of modifications to these narratives that both preserve and adjust that group’s narrative identity. In other words, their narrated past changes in order to stay the same. Ricoeur points to biblical Israel as such a narrative community: “It was in telling these narratives taken to be testimony about the founding events of its history that biblical Israel became the historical community that bears this name. The relation is circular—the historical community called the Jewish people has drawn its identity from the reception of those texts that it had produced.”2This illuminates, I think, some of the ways in which religious dissent in eighteenth‐century England represented itself to itself as a historical community.<br>

Abstract: Memory and reciprocity between author and reader, in the way a good teacher connects with students, is also part of Braudel’s earliest writing of
         La Méditerranée; this is a third approach to the question of readers’ responses. In the preface to the first edition Braudel invites the reader to participate in the book’s image‐ and memory‐making: “The reader who approaches this book in the spirit I would wish will do well to bring with him his own memories, his own vision of the Mediterranean to add colour to the text and to help me conjure up this vast presence, as I have done my best to do.” And in this same spirit of memory and reciprocity, Braudel in turn returns to his own student days to remember the “unwavering conviction” imparted by his teachers: “if I have retained nothing else from the geographers who taught me at the Sorbonne,” it was that the “sea itself, the one we see and love, is the greatest document of its past existence.”79Thus it is not by chance that Braudel’s 1969 manuscript on the Mediterranean in prehistory and antiquity (“la très longue durée”), not published until 1998, is calledMemory and the Mediterranean,and its opening paragraph, with the heading “Seeing the Sea,” eloquently explains how memory reconstitutes reality for Braudel: “This is a sea that patiently recreates for us scenes from the past, breathing new life into them, locating them under a sky and in a landscape that we can see with our own eyes, a landscape and sky like those of long ago. A moment’s concentration or daydreaming, and that past comes back to life.”80The Braudelian metaphor is resuscitation and re‐creation. There is not the slightest hint of spiritualist resurrection; Braudel invokes instead the dynamism of waves. “Mediterranean civilization spreads far beyond its shores in great waves that are balanced by continual returns. What leaves the sea comes back and then departs once more.”81And even though these waves can turn into metaphors of precision instrument~<br>

Abstract: The reassertion of a literary norm within the field of informational writing seemed to respond to a perceived decline in the communicative effectiveness of writing that paced the explosion of information and media. The tension between clarity, which posits a hypothetical general reader, and technicity, which assumes a specialized addressee, has never been resolved. The failure of modern writing to achieve clarity brings technicity into disrepute; but technicity is an inescapable requisite of modern writing and is not, in itself, incompatible with clarity or communication. An analysis of informational writing that fails to recognize the complex relation between clarity and technicity is unlikely to yield a composition pedagogy adequate to the demands upon writing in modernity. The reassertion of clarity by the literary professoriate, like the reassertion of brevity, forgets the inaugural act of information genres, forgets the forgetting of rhetoric.<br>

Abstract: The Christocentric requirement can best be understood in terms of the first of the above‐mentioned interpretive movements. The world of contemporary experience is interpreted in light of the claims of the tradition. Thus, for example, the human predicament (for which Tillich asserts Christianity provides the answers) will itself be cast in terms of the Christian message; contemporary questions will be formulated in light of Christian answers. Theologians like George Lindbeck (building on the work of Hans Frei) and Tracy appeal to contemporary theories of literary reference to understand this capacity of a religious tradition to shape human experience.
         16According to such theories, the reference of a text stands in front of it, namely, in the world this text opens up for the reader. Thus the Christian “text”—consisting of the classic texts of the Christian tradition, founded upon, but not restricted to, the Christian Bible—projects a domain of meaning in which Christians are to locate—and thereby to redefine—their own experiences of reality.17The traditional notion of the imitation of Christ, for example, can be fruitfully understood in terms of this concept of “intratextuality.” Personal suffering acquires redemptive significance for a Christian when it is experienced as an imitation of Christ’s suffering; to suffer as a Christian is to be imaginatively present with Christ in his agony.18According to George Lindbeck, the primary task of the theologian is to extend the domain of meaning projected by the Bible to the whole of reality.19<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: The reader will find Bourgeois’s treatment of specific topics useful and insightful, topics such as Martin Heidegger on the relation of limit, death, and the “end of philosophy” (chap. 2) or Ricoeur’s engagement with Lévinas on ethics as the face‐to‐face relation to the other (chap. 8). However, the primary argument of the book as a whole sometimes devolves into a Procrustean bed, cutting away the complexity of Heideggerian and post‐Heideggerian thought to make it fit an overreaching, insufficiently qualified thesis regarding the trajectory of twentieth‐century philosophy. Unfortunately, the reader may find it difficult to disentangle the valuable contributions of the book from the more ambitious but problematic agenda driving it. The thrust of this overarching argument is that, at a pivotal juncture in continental intellectual history, a colossal error in construing Kant’s concept of the “boundary of reason” took hold, preventing a proper understanding of the relation of the enterprise of critique to its grounding in reason and leading (apparently inexorably) to the aporias of “philosophy in the twentieth century” (p. xiv). All the trouble about the closure of meaning in recent continental thought could have been averted, the author argues, if Heidegger and post‐Heideggerian philosophers (e.g., Jacques Derrida, John Caputo, Jean François Lyotard, Emmanuel Lévinas) merely had paid more careful attention to a critical conceptual distinction Kant took pains to make between a “boundary” (
      Grenze) and a “limit” (Schranke) in theProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysics(sec. 57).<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: Where Meyers looks at images, McNay examines theorists: Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Paul Ricoeur, and Cornelius Castoriadis. In each case McNay lays out what she takes to be the merits of each writer’s views, while asking how the important step for feminists, from theory to action, is to be taken. And in each case the answer to this question is elusive. This is due in part to internal differences between the writers McNay considers. It is far from clear that Butler’s views on the body inform the same idea of agency as Ricoeur’s theory of narrative, for example, and as the text grows increasingly complex the very concept of agency seems to recede. This elusiveness is also partly due to the critique of theory itself. While striving to preserve the value in each competing view of subjectivity, McNay draws the reader’s attention to such serious drawbacks that one despairs for these theories altogether.<br>

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: If the bloodstained shroud echoes the Eucharist, the linen cloth spread on the altar of a church echoes the shroud.
      99I have already explained that, faithful to a topos of Italian baroque style, Tesauro founds his writing on two basic metaphors, what he calls “similarity” and “opposition.” Borrowing again from Balliani’sRagionamenti, Tesauro posits a direct mirroring between Christ and the linen cloth.100“What is linen,” he asks the reader, “but a plant born in tears?” Describing how linen is produced, Tesauro writes: “It [linen] is pulled away from its native earth, then drowned in water, then torn, lacerated, and beaten.” Later, it is “stretched on the cross of a loom and pierced thousands of times.” As the prophet foresaw (Isa. 43:17), linen is the symbol of martyrdom. Consequently, “what is the shroud but a martyr in cloth? What is a martyr but a shroud in flesh? Or better yet, what is the shroud but the idea [idea] of all martyrs?”101Being the visible sign of martyrdom, Tesauro hypothesizes that the shroud, and not the cross, will become visible at Doomsday. The “the sign of the Son of Man in heaven” that Christ mentions to his disciples (Matt. 24:30) will be the shroud stained with his blood.102Before sending his angels to gather his elect, the Word will show his own shroud, the supreme “vestige” and emblem of his incarnation. The shroud in Turin will be reflected in the heavens, as a final agreement between earth and sky.<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: What is particularly intriguing here is Frei’s connection between the “particularistic” practices of reading represented by Midrash and the “cultural future” of civilization. Adherence to the literal sense, through typological practices of reading, thus cultivates a practice and informs a worldview that can resist and challenge the universal, hegemonic tendencies of modernity. As he continues, “The Protestant theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher called Judaism a fossil religion, in part at least out of the animus which many Rationalist, Romantic, and Idealistic thinkers bore toward Jewish particularism. And yet it is now conceivable that that `fossil' may bear more of the future of the culture of the West in its hands than Christianity, and its traditional, particularistic forms may not be adventitious to the fact.” The “fossilization” of Judaism from the perspective of the Enlightenment is well known; moreover, the rejection of Jewish particularism by Rationalism, Romanticism, and Idealism bears a strong resemblance to the simultaneous occlusion of the practice of figural reading so powerfully described in
         Eclipse: “Beyond that, however, the example of Judaism in the modern Western world might be a beacon to a reconstituted Christian community. One never knows what this community might then contribute once again to that culture or its residues, including its political life, its quest for justice and freedom—and even its literature. If the priorities are rightly ordered, the literal sense may be counted on to play a significant part in such a less pretentious enterprise. It will stretch and not break.” As Frei notes, such cultural benefits must be considered “secondary” or “incidental”—yet, this paragraph speaks volumes as to the potentially transformative impact that he envisages through adherence to the literal sense of scripture and attention to its relation to Midrash. Such potential is highly significant, given Frei’s frequent disparagement of allegoric~<br>

Abstract: Of course the author retains his or her own voice when he or she uses the footnote as a record of conversations with other scholars. The reader goes to footnotes to find out who is talking to whom, who is being listened to, and who is being ignored. They are the place for polemics (if the body of the essay is judged inappropriate for such matters); thus, a footnote may be marginal without being minor. Footnoting can also be a way for the author to reveal more of his or her personality, to step out of the bounds of the self created by formal academic discourse; or, if the essay is personal in nature, the footnote may be the place to reassure the reader that he or she may be getting intimate but is still a professional. The footnote, then, can be distinguished not only spatially but aurally as well.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: Other recognition theories, in particular those of Hegel and his followers, have explored important insights regarding the integration of recognition into knowledge. If these insights are right, grasping an object with a concept would engage one’s thoughts in a self‐recognition project that is arguably in line with the “lived experiences” referred to by Ricoeur. The section dealing with the “ruins of representation” misses the opportunity to show how to reconstruct knowledge claims on these ruins. On the one hand, one could argue that a theory of knowledge would simply be sided with a compatible theory of recognition. On the other hand, neo‐Hegelians, such as Robert B. Brandom, would press for profound changes in the way that theories of knowledge are to be understood. It is left to the reader to locate the hermeneutical analysis of Ricoeur in this debate.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, as Hannah Arendt has pointed out, “Goodness in an absolute sense, as distinguished from the good‐for’ or the excellent’ in Greek and Roman antiquity, became known in our civilization only with the rise of Christianity” (Hannah Arendt,
            The Human Condition[Chicago, 1958], p. 73). The analysis of Goodness provided inThe Human Conditionand in which Arendt highlights the constitutive secrecy of good works, which must remain hidden even to the one who performs them—a good deed being good only on condition that it is forgotten at the moment it is done—as well as Goodness’s intrinsic hostility toward the public realm, converges in many respects with what Patočka—a reader of Arendt—says about this notion, as well as with all the implications that Derrida draws in systematic fashion from this conception inThe Gift of Death.<br>

Issue: 509555<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: This is not to argue against the kind of verification fundamental to scientific history, though it does side with Warnock’s observation that a positivist approach can miss the role of human imagination in not merely perceiving but also constructing reality. Rather, it is to argue for something besides the power of description at work in certain narratives, especially those that rise to the level of mythos and make a claim to religious authority. Smith’s narratives do not display fact to be assented to but draw the reader into a malleable reality by means of the malleable plots that traditionally provided the basis for Jewish and Christian ethos and ethic. It can be said that Smith was translating time, not text. Specifically, he translated biblical time in service to, he said, an “ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times … a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers … from the days of Adam even to the present time.”
         97Whatever his intention, the effect was to deploy the biblical text in a manner that radically subverted centuries of theologizing on who God is and how humans are to worship God.<br>

Abstract: “I chose this story above all others because it’s a story I’m struggling to end. … That’s why I write fiction—so that I can keep telling the story. … Always a new beginning, a different end,” Winterson writes toward the close of her narrative (
         2005, 137). Linking the desire for retelling with the inability to formulate a conclusion and the necessity for an open ending, Winterson has Atlas walk away, yet presents this “very particular end not found elsewhere” (xiv) as but one possibility among several, the choice of which is ultimately left to the individual reader’s personal preference: “no one knows its composition,” Winterson observes. “Dark matter could be conventional matter, … or it could even be black holes. Or it could be Atlas holding up the universe. But I think it is Atlas and Laïka walking away” (2005, 151).Weight’s multiperspectival ending underscores its status as inaugural retelling of myth for a twenty‐first century that can only assimilate more pasts into its ever broadening present. In this sense, the Myths seems typical for the contemporary take on re‐vision. Whereas the names of the authors hold the promise of retellings with a critical edge—Achebe having given usThings Fall Apartas a reply to and a thorough undermining of Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darkness(see Moyers1989; Achebe1990), and neither Atwood nor Winterson is a stranger to rewriting as cultural critique—Winterson’s phrase and its appropriation by the series’ editor make us suspect differently. “We want to tell the story again,” as the series’ editor Jamie Byng puts it on Canongate’s Web site, speaks of the storyteller’s desire for and delight in language; of the pleasure of telling stories, of keeping the stories alive by retelling them. Inevitably also meaning “we want tosellthe story again,” retelling becomes a retailing strategy, promising ever new and improved reading experiences that are as ephemeral as any other consumer experience.

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: So I return to that invented novel one last time, anomalous though it is, as an exemplar of more familiar novelistic tendencies in order to make clear the methodological implications its concoction does
         notentail. Narratography per se has nothing to do with the conjuration of wholesale counternovels. Albeit an assiduous close reader of fiction, that Oxford don is no practitioner of narratography—or at least not in anything we've heard from him here. He is a virtual biographer, in other words a fiction writer. The contrapuntal tale of the lost mother takes to an extreme dilation the fleeting thoughts anyone might have in learning of her so suddenly, and then learning no more, and then being denied even the closural satisfaction of watching the hero find out the stunning truth, even if it only transpired for the reader in a second or two of reflective recoil from the headlong settlements of the plot. But the work of narratography (a matter always of diction, syntax, punctuation, figuration) comes later—most intensely when the very wordmother's(possessive in every sense) is seen to assimilate the male hero to its lexical confines across the prose cadence, and ghostly grammatical antecedence, of plot's immediate marital aftermath.<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine, “Reply to Faustus the Manichean,” par. 75. To the modern reader, these comments and their attention to character say frustratingly little that echoes the idea that war is justified and limited in principled ways. While it is true that Augustine shows little interest in questions such as noncombatant immunity, the
            jus in bello, and the related idea of human rights, I believe it requires little to draw out such ideas from his account. Intentionally killing innocent persons is symptomatic of a deeper set of disordered motives. Such killing is wrong on Augustinian terms because it flows from concupiscent affections. Others’ claim to be left alone is violated by persons who seek to subject them to their avaricious desires. As Babcock suggests, attending to how virtues restrain human impulses enables us to see how Augustine could speak to such modern concerns. Langan’s views on this matter are qualified, but he captures the general point when he observes that Augustine’s warnings against being motivated by revenge “point the way to a limitation of the horrors of war by focusing on the virtues and attitudes of warriors. This does not eliminate the need for a rule of noncombatant immunity, but it is reasonable to think that care to develop a regard for certain moral virtues and values among soldiers would contribute in an important and perhaps decisive way to the preservation of many of the values which the rules ofjus in belloare designed to protect.” See Hartigan, “St. Augustine on War and Killing: The Problem of the Innocent,” 195–204; Babcock, “Cupiditas and Caritas,” 47; Langan, “Elements of St. Augustine’s Just‐War Theory,” 32; Swift, “Augustine on War and Killing,” 369–83.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: If that is indeed the case, it is our historical duty to realize that the rhetoric of
      Confessionscomprises both sound and silence to the effect that the fullness of voice can sound in such a way that it is possible to say about Augustine—and his reader—that he “did not hear [its] silence.” Is that perhaps the essence of the fact that what Augustine is looking for cannot but be a momentary gift and that the rhetoric of this search in all its loudness comes down to shaping the fact that it cannot be ascertained, beyond the “speech act” ofconfessioitself, whether that which is given sounds or not? Saying this, we do not find ourselves in the realm of mystical silence. We are, rather, faced with the demands of rhetorical precision. For to establish the magic of a language of desire that is given—a language with the power of Kafka's hammer of the facts of life in the shape of the song of the Sirens—confessiohas to be framed and shaped, dramatized and theatricalized. Consequently, the possibility has to be taken into account that the phrase “Ulysses did not hear the silence of the Sirens” is not the final word about the matter, just as the dialectic of speech and silence cannot be taken to function as an automatism.<br>

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: Due to the encyclopedic character of the work and the extensive range it covers, however, certain significant thinkers are often treated too quickly, whereas other, more marginal thinkers are treated too closely. This is particularly the case in his treatment of hermeneutics in the “pre-modern” period. For example, in chapter 6, entitled “From the Third Century to the Thirteenth Centuries,” he covers no fewer than twenty-four thinkers. At times, one feels flooded and inundated with a litany of references and historical facts, and it is easy to get confused as to the overall trajectory and purpose of the chapter and how it contributes to the formation and development of hermeneutics. The work would have been better served if it was more balanced and had devoted the same kind of sustained attention and precision to important “pre-modern” thinkers that it devoted to many key figures in modern and contemporary hermeneutics. In the same vein, in the rush to cover the history of hermeneutics, chapters are often oddly divided. For instance, the reader may be surprised to find the thought of Karl Barth lumped in together with structuralism and poststructuralism in a chapter loosely titled, “Some Mid-Twentieth Century Approaches.” It remains unclear as to why such disparate figures and strands of thought are gathered together into a single chapter, and it thus lacks the tightness and coherence of argument that it otherwise could have. If certain sections may glide over thinkers too quickly and other sections pay attention too closely, there are, despite the encyclopedic range of this book, certain gaps altogether in the history of hermeneutics that Thistleton offers. Thistleton himself concedes in his conclusion, for example, that there is insufficient attention paid particularly to Catholic biblical scholarship, which clearly indicates a way of introducing hermeneutics from a distinctly Protestant perspective. Any work that seeks to introduce a subject matter necessarily ma~<br>

Abstract: Interest in popular song, of course, has remained robust, but the same cannot be said for written forms of poetry. Nor is the decline of the latter the result, as one sometimes hears, of a widespread postmodern skepticism about selfhood. On the contrary, the general reader today, having been blessedly spared the ravages of postmodernism, is more obsessed with selfhood than ever before. The clearest evidence of this is the barrage of memoirs to which we have been subjected in recent years (not to mention biographical documentaries, fictional life stories, and the usual steady stream of strong protagonists). We are still deeply fascinated by selves, but for some reason we have become convinced that the important questions about them are
            historical: where they came from, what that did to them, how they overcame it. That is why poetry and painting are, for now at least, losing the war against narrative forms.<br>

Abstract: The text covers a lot of ground, delving into many of the touch points between theology and human rights and endeavoring to demonstrate how those points can be sources of mutual enrichment rather than conflict. At times the comprehensive scope of the text, which draws on the insights of so many, makes it a challenging read and leaves the reader wanting more development and illustration of the fruits of the author’s argument. Overall, the text is an important contribution to the constructive engagement between theology and human rights discourse and is a serious challenge to those in either camp who would peremptorily reject the insights of the other.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: In the first two chapters Fisher explains how he selected these four components through critical engagement with the theories of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur (chap. 1), and Pierre Hadot and William Alston (chap. 2). In the remaining two chapters Fisher applies the Jewish theological practice model to two Jewish texts: the rabbinic anthology
      Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael(chap. 3) and Franz Rosenzweig’sStar of Redemption(chap. 4). With a new understanding of theology, the reader is expected to understand not only why it is wrong to marginalize Jewish theology within Jewish studies but also why Jewish thinking is inherently theological. Borrowing from Philo, Fisher titles his bookContemplative Nationto indicate that “Israel” should be defined not by ethnicity, politics, or culture but rather by “being genuinely concerned with God and the divine-human relationship” (16). In his conclusion, Fisher reiterates that “the task of the Jewish people, and not just its religious elite, [is] to direct their thoughts to God and the divine-human relationship” (223). If “Israel” and “Jewish people” are interchangeable terms, to be Jewish is inherently a theological practice, as far as Fisher is concerned.<br>

Abstract: The question with which I propose to replace Adam’s—namely, can evil be spoken with immunity—can be asked not only of Eve but of several figures in
         Paradise Lost. The process of manufacturing satanic speech is a key element in the poem, one that is most vividly on display in that section of the poem (bks. 5–8) in which Satan himself is silent. It is perhaps not surprising that no one misses the poem’s most compelling figure even though he disappears for an entire third of its action. This is probably because while he is away the unfallen characters spend such a great deal of time imagining what he did or would say. Satan may leave us, but the satanic voice never does. The one figure in the poem that speaks almost as many “satanic” lines as the devil himself is Raphael. And just as the overemphasis on the satanic source of the dream voice displaces Eve as its speaker, it is likewise all too easy to lose sight of Raphael’s role as creator in these middle books. Wherever the satanic voice surfaces, Satan himself steals the show in the imagination of the reader, relegating the creative work of the actual speaker to the background.<br>

Abstract: The chapters that follow work out these dynamics in a variety of settings. The word
      investmentis a leitmotif, and she first tracks it through Shakespeare’sHenry IVandHamlet, where it tangles together “clothing, commerce, and religion” (35), preparing us for the deep puns at the heart of the Vestiarian Controversy. Chapters on the metaphoricity of the sacrament and on John Donne treat theological questions and, particularly with Donne, “the danger that I [the critic] will find creative metaphor — the magician’s fictive art — where a Renaissance reader would find an assertion of code” (70). A closely argued chapter on classical rhetoric shows how some English translations of Cicero and Quintilian suggest a sharper distinction between metaphor and catachresis than the Romans were willing to make. The productivity of metaphor, to the point of abuse, is deep in the tradition.<br>

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: Although the clarity with which Wu writes makes this book accessible to nonspecialists, he evidently assumes the reader is familiar with China and the subject of tombs. For example, no maps are included, despite frequent mentions made of specific provinces and cities. Additionally, no matter how obscure or technical the terms, he provides Chinese characters in only one instance (128). The reliance on pinyin romanization may make it somewhat frustrating for specialists encountering these terms for the first time to understand them or even to look them up in a dictionary. Oddly, several line drawings and diagrams only employ Chinese characters; it would have been helpful for Wu to translate these. However, these minor shortcomings do not overshadow the overall importance of this book. On account of its remarkably original theoretical approach,
   The Art of the Yellow Springsis essential reading material for anyone interested in a new interpretation of Chinese tombs.<br>

Abstract: Every text aims to seduce its reader. If the text at the same time lays claim to having scientific value, we readers must ask whether seduction stands in the way of truth. As a concept, seduction lies halfway between an assault and conversation. As opposed to assault, seduction conveys a dimension of voluntarily being swept off one's feet. As opposed to conversation, seduction implies that one loses one's senses for a moment. Who, then, is really subject and who is object in seduction? The thesis I will argue here is that the readership's or audience's only chance of taking on the role of subjects, in a textual seduction, is to lose their senses first. Rather than being an assault against scientific ethics, seduction is a necessary premise for a sensible conversation to take place.<br>

Article Title: Generic Studies: Their Renewed Importance in Religious and Literary Interpretation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263709<br>
Date: 9 1, 1975<br>
Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Date: 3 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein Matthew G.<br>
Abstract: This article addresses a seeming aporia for the modern reader of Augustine's "Confessiones:" why is it that Augustine refuses to name significant figures in his life throughout his self-narrative? By way of attempting an answer, I begin with the formal problems of the "Confessiones," that is, how one should approach such a fractured and rhetorically disciplined text. Then I address the more specific problem that has been curiously neglected by a whole range of commentators: the violent unnaming and defacing that occurs as a result of Augustine's willful forgetting of particular people who were once close to him. I draw the conclusions that such unnaming was not an oversight committed by Augustine, that he does so in order to distance his own conversion experience from less inspiring stories, and that this is part of a conscious, rhetorical agenda to align his own name with certain distinguished members of the Latin Church.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303101<br>
Date: 7 1, 1938<br>
Author(s): Al-Zayyat Israel<br>
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Issue: i20184615<br>
Date: 11 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Iguchi Kawori<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Abstract: È importante chiarire che "postmodernismo" è un termine vago, controverso e troppo
ampio per significare una posizione precisa; sotto tale etichetta si sogliono designare cose
tanto diverse quanto il periodo seguente al "modernismo" (avente come inizio per alcuni
il secondo dopoguerra e per altri gli anni '6o del secolo scorso) quanto i prodotti culturali
delle società a capitalismo avanzato. Si veda per esempio J.-F. Lyotard, La condition postmo-
derne: rapport sul le savoir, Paris 1979; J. Habermas, 'Modernity- and Incomplete Project',
New German Critique 22, 1981, pp. 3-14, e per un inquadramento generale T. Docherty (ed.),
Postmodernism: a Reader, New York 1993. Viceversa sarebbe corretto parlare di "poststrut-
turalismo" in riferimento all'atteggiamento teorico di critica alle categorie intellettuali
tradizionali che nasce come reazione allo strutturalismo e come sua trasformazione; si
comprenderà qui tanto la pratica critica e teorica dell'antropologia di Clifford Geertz (con
l'enfasi posta sul concetto di "locale" e "particolare" in opposizione a "universale" e "ge-
nerale"), quanto quella letteraria del decostruzionismo di Jacques Derrida e Julia Kristeva,
o a posizioni critiche diversificate, da Roland Barthes a Michel Foucault. Cfr. per la critica
letteraria in particolare R. Young (ed.), Untying the Text: a Post-Structuralist Reader, Boston
1981. Ma anche nel caso del termine "poststrutturalismo", l'ampiezza eccessiva delle posi-
zioni designate finisce a mio avviso con il risultare un ostacolo alla comprensione piuttosto
che uno strumento di chiarezza.<br>

Article Title: Tempo e ragione: Il Settecento di Arthur O. Lovejoy<br>
Publisher: Edizioni Dedalo<br>
Issue: i20565615<br>
Date: 6 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Festa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Il libro fu accolto alla sua uscita con immediato favore. «The Crozer Quarterly» ne
parlò come «one book on philosophy that ought to come into the hands of the general
reader» (E.M. Austin, «The Crozer Quarterly», 14, 1937, pp. 149-150); Clifford Barret
sulla «New York Times Book Review» del 9 maggio 1937, sosteneva che «no student of
the history of literature, science or philosophy may well neglect it»; John Laird, su
«Mind» (46, 1937, pp. 400-405), lo definiva un libro «very good to read», e E. Nagel,
su «New Republic» (89, 1936, p. 224), lo descriveva come «fascinating and moving». La
valutazione dell'opera è continuata nei decenni successivi, intrecciandosi alla discussione
sul metodo storico prescelto dallo studioso. Molti interventi si focalizzarono sul signifi-
cato che Lovejoy attribuiva al termine unit-idea: alcuni, corne M. Mandelbaum (The Hi-
story of Ideas, Intellectual History, and the History of Philosophy, in «History and
Theory», 5, Beiheft, 1965, pp. 33-66), lamentarono che tali unit-ideas potevano essere
«recurrant ideas» e non «continuing ideas», o anche soltanto «family resemblances» (cfr.
anche N.B. Kvastad, On Method in the History of Ideas, in «International Logic Review»,
9, 1979, pp. 96-110). In altri casi venne criticato il rapporto di causa-effetto'che Lovejoy
aveva adottato. L.O. Mink sostenne che lo storico delle idee non doveva interessarsi tan-
to al problema di come un certo pensatore aveva influenzato un altro pensatore, quan-
to piuttosto comprendere in che modo un'idea aveva funzionato e come era divenuta
parte dei processi culturali e della coscienza di un'epoca (cfr. L.O. Mink, Change and
Causality in the History of Ideas, in «Eighteenth Century Studies», 2, 1968, pp. 7-25; cfr.
anche R.H. Pearce, A Note on Method in the History of Ideas, in «Journal of the Hi-
story of Ideas», 9, 1949, pp. 372-379). In generale comunque si apprezzò lo sforzo lo-
vejoyano di rompere le barriere tra le discipline (cfr. T. Bredsdorff, Lovejovianism~<br>

Abstract: «[...] a small number of what I consider to be particularly important emblems, inserted in
key positions, bring the reader up with a jolt. These pivotal emblems are often those
which are visually most striking and most memorable, the ones in which the image itself
serves to deliver a vicious attack on the Roman Catholic church (18,32,35,37)», op. cit.,
p. 146; pour l'analyse de la structure générale, voir les pages 123 à 143.
La question posée au moins implicitement par A. Adams est celle de l'existence d'une
structure mnémotechnique. Cette hypothèse est clairement rejetée par Christophe Chaza-
lon en ce qui concerne les Icones, où « les cadres sont utilisés de façon totalement aléa-
toire » alors que « les portraits sont indifféremment de profil ou de 3/4, gauche ou droit, en
fonction des portraits qui ont servi de modèle.» (op. cit., p. 21, n. 62). D'une manière
générale, une utilisation consciente et systématique des principes de l'art de la mémoire
paraît peu probable lorsqu'on sait que les humanistes aussi bien catholiques que protes-
tants, s'inscrivant dans la tradition de Quintilien, ont adopté une attitude pour le moins
sceptique à l'égard de la mémoire artificielle. Frances A. Yates rappelle entre autres la
position de Melanchthon qui « interdit aux étudiants de recourir au moindre expédient
mnémotechnique, et [qui] les invite à apprendre par c ur de la façon normale, en voyant
là le seul art de la mémoire» (L'Art de la mémoire, Gallimard, 1975, p. 142).<br>

Abstract: At its most a typical sports narrative records what happens in space and time. Alongside this traditional history of events there has emerged a research approach that might be called structural sports history. Its methods move in the world under the surface of facts, explored by researchers in ways that resemble archaeology. The aim is to uncover the changed human relationships and new forms of presence in sport-figurations of corporeality, space and time. Where the event-history approach recounts and recapitulates, the new approach works towards interpretation and understanding. These two are joined by yet a third element, the most intimate aspect of sports narratives: microhistory and the routes that it opens to the interfaces between the public and the private and the general and the particular, where the reader-oriented focus of the experiencing and narrating subject is necessarily foregrounded and at this point surface such elements of narrativity as the "confessional", the "meditative" and the "fragmentary" (auto)biography. The article describes different levels of a sports narrative and their conventions in qualitative sports research.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: Some literary theorists have suggested that the process of reading is a complex one and is central to the interpretation of texts. These theorists do not ignore the creation of texts or the authors' creative activities, but place special emphasis on the role of the reader. This approach has relevance for the study of the use of libraries. This paper offers an analogy between text and library and between reader and library user. The analogy is possible because both reader and user adopt intentional stances with regard to that which is to be interpreted and employ cognitive and affective means in interpretation. At the heart of this approach is a phenomenological-hermeneutical way of thinking that treats reading and library use as an event consisting of varying intention and interpretive possibilities.<br>

Publisher: Editions Belin<br>
Issue: i20874401<br>
Date: 3 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Cohen-Cheminet Geneviève<br>
Abstract: This paper suggests Charles Reznikoff's poetry should be assessed in its relation to the Jewish hermeneutical tradition. Philosopher Paul Ricœur's quotation in the title, "the very deciphering of life in the mirror of the text," sums up Reznikoff's poetical strategy. He decontextualizes his writing by displacing it towards its hypotextual origin, Jewish and non-Jewish. Reading destabilizes the reader who embraces the poetical text in the mirror of its hypotexts. This move metaphorically takes reading and writing away from their familiar American grounds and paves the way for an ethics of perambulation.<br>

Author(s): Franzosi Roberto<br>
Abstract: In this paper I explore the questions of why and how sociologists should be interested in narrative. The answer to the first question is straightforward: Narrative texts are packed with sociological information, and a great deal of our empirical evidence is in narrative form. In an attempt to answer the second question, I look at definitions of narrative, distinguishing narrative from non-narrative texts. I highlight the linguistic properties of narrative and illustrate modes of analysis, paying close attention to both the structural properties of the text and its subtle linguistic nuances. I guide the reader through a detailed analysis of a short narrative text. I show how linguistics and sociology interplay at the level of a text.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo es un intento de aproximación a las singularidades de Pablo Neruda como lector, sobre la base de su doble condición de lector que hace un uso libre e intencionado de los textos, y de lector antilibresco. Examina dos vertientes de lecturas de Neruda, aquellas vinculadas con la tradición literaria —a las que el poeta denomina "el bosque de la literatura"—, y las otras, extra literarias, relacionadas con diversas disciplinas y con la historia del conocimiento. El artículo se ocupa también de la transición entre la lectura textual y la lectura del mundo en Neruda. This article intends to approach the peculiarities of Pablo Neruda as a reader, on the basis of his dual status of reader who makes a free and deliberate use of texts, and as a reader that neglects the intellectuality of books. In this light, two aspects of Neruda's readings are examined: those associated with the literary tradition which the poet calls "the forest of literature", and extra-literary readings related to varied disciplines and the history of knowledge. The article also discusses the transition between textual reading and the reading of the world in Neruda.<br>

Abstract: Against the backdrop of the current popularity of the concept of narrative in the social sciences the authors analyse the uses of narrative analysis in empirical social research and provide a unifying frame based on Paul Ricoeur's notion of narrative mimesis. To begin they situate 'narrative' in the context of the social research tradition. Using both a simple and an elaborated definition of narrative they outline the main approaches to narrative analysis relevant to sociology and categorize them as structuralist, hermeneutic, or interactionist. The crux of the article is a discussion of Ricoeur's integrative model of narrative as threefold mimesis and its proposed methodological application in sociological narrative research. The authors argue that Ricoeur's model obviates undesirable analytical simplifications and encourages research that captures all the substantial aspects of narrative, including the producer (the narrator) and the recipient (the listener or reader).<br>

Abstract: This article explores the functions and legacy of Diedrich Knickerbocker, the fictional narrator-historian of Washington Irving's first major work, A History of New York, From the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty (1809). I argue that Irving deploys a number of self-conscious strategies to produce a cultural memory of New York in and through Knickerbocker and his text. Perhaps most important, Knickerbocker generates the first serviceable English-language account of New Amsterdam, an account that haunts the space of New York with its Dutch and Indian pasts. Second, by reflecting on the theories and craft of history, Knickerbocker explores the problems and possibilities of American historical representation. Third, through a range of quixotic strategies, Knickerbocker implicates the reader in the construction of his history. And finally, Knickerbocker actively writes himself into the story he is telling, merging his fictional identities with New York's history. By describing the ways in which Knickerbocker insinuates himself and his New York into the actual New York, I aim to trace the complexities of Irving's historiographic thinking and to show how accounts of the past can become part of a living cultural memory.<br>

Abstract: Biblical texts make demands which the reader cannot refrain from answering. In giving an answer, the reader should dare to say more than the text has already said and to take responsibility for this. This biblical demand forces us to understand by ourselves and does not offer the possibility of referring to something that is already understood. To understand a biblical text, one must therefore take the risk of misunderstanding. In view of this precarious freedom, the author shows that hermeneutical research is necessary in order to avoid accidents in understanding. We first see a text, then we read it and finally understand it by creating a "text world". Thus we can misunderstand a text if we don't see or read it correctly or if we miss the essence of the text. Any research on misunderstanding texts would have to deal with the relationship between the reader's own understanding and that which is not the reader's own. Understanding is not only what we understand, nor is it only understanding that which is foreign to us in a text, it is always both.<br>

Abstract: The problem that Petrarch's Canzoniere poses for the modern reader is the same as that posed by all collections of poems assembled by their author: it is a matter of understanding the connection between each of the poems and the collection, the relation between the whole and the parts. On the one hand, the collection presents a discontinuous series of poems composed separately that can be read as discrete works; on the other hand, the same poems come together as part of a love and/or existential story. Our task is to study the Canzoniere as a macrotext and to clarify the relation of each of the compositions to the collection of lyric verse to which it belongs. Petrarch's desperate attempt to complete his work is the same hopeless challenge that the mythical Arachne dared to make to Minerva. At the deepest level Petrarch reveals an awareness of the fact that every human endeavor is a spider's web that is woven in the course of a lifetime, and thus is never completed. The destiny of human beings therefore is to weave a tapestry that is never finished, just as the fate of the poet is to write an in-finite work; namely, a work that in the end can never reach the perfection and integrity of the divine work.<br>

Abstract: The new theology of revelation in dealing with the inspiration of the Scriptures has to face the problem of time. Such a theory should neither be based on the concept of a pure „inspiration at the beginning“ nor on the „inspiration of the reader“. Whilst the former alone is unsatisfactory the latter would abandon the normativity of Scriptures and Tradition. By drawing on some ideas of Paul Ricoeur, the article develops an understanding of inspiration that is guided by the concept of „pneumatological passivity“. This pneumatological perspective enables under the aspect of time a „narrative“ understanding of the identity of the church.<br>

Abstract: Se revendiquant d'E. Betti dans le débat qu'il eut avec H.-G. Gadamer, Fazlur Rahman défend la possibilité de connaître avec certitude le sens objectif du Coran, qu'il dissocie du sens littéral. Ce sens objectif, qui correspond à l'intention divine, est pour ce réformiste indo-pakistanais en accord avec les valeurs universelles de la modernité. Or plusieurs intellectuels, dont le sud-africain Farid Esack, reprennent l'argument gadamérien de l'historicité de toute interprétation pour critiquer l'idée qu'une lecture puisse être objective. Ainsi, classique ou moderne, aucune interprétation ne serait dénuée de préjugés, et prétendre le contraire reviendrait à enfermer le Coran dans l'historicité du lecteur. Même si Rahman relativise son propos en rappelant la difficulté de la recherche de l'objectivité, le problème que pose son modernisme est qu'il risque de céder à l'illusion d'un islam véritable, authentique, qui arrêterait alors le mouvement de réinterprétation du texte. Taking a stand for E. Betti in the debate he had with H.G. Gadamer, Fazlur Rahman defends the possibility of knowing with certainty the objective meaning of the Quran, which differs from the literal sense. For the Indo-Pakistani reformist, this objective meaning, which corresponds to the divine intention, is in accordance with the universal values of modernity. Yet, many intellectuals, including South African Farid Esack, takes up the Gadamerian argument and plead for the historicity of any interpretation, criticizing the idea that an interpretation can be objective. In that view, be it classical or modern, no interpretation would be without prejudice, and pretending otherwise would confine the Quran to the historicity of the reader. Even if Rahman restates the difficulty of the search for objectivity, the problem of his modernism is that it may give the illusion of a real, authentic Islam, which then forecloses the dynamics of textual reinterpretation.

Abstract: This article proposes literary criticism as a source of insight into consumer behavior, presents a broad overview of literary criticism, provides a specific illustrative analysis, and offers suggestions for further research. Literary analysis of advertising text reveals elements that provide additional information to consumer researchers, and contributions of literary criticism to consumer research are discussed. Major post-war critical schools are reviewed, and relevant theoretical concepts summarized. An ad for Ivory Flakes is analyzed using a variety of concepts drawn from literary schools, primarily sociocultural and reader-response ones. Suggestions for additional research on content analysis, image analysis, and the history of consumption are made.<br>

Article Title: Success, Truth, and Modernism in Holocaust Historiography: Reading Saul Friedländer Thirty-Five Years after the Publication of "Metahistory"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25478832<br>
Date: 5 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Kansteiner Wulf<br>
Abstract: This essay provides a close reading of Saul Friedländer's exceptionally successful comprehensive history of the Holocaust from the theoretical perspective of Hayden White's philosophy of history. Friedländer's The Years of Extermination has been celebrated as the first synthetic history of the "Final Solution" that acknowledges the experiences of the victims of Nazi genocide. But Friedländer has not simply added the voices of the victims to a conventional historical account of the Holocaust. Instead, by displacing linear notions of time and space and subtly deconstructing conventional concepts of causality, he has invented a new type of historical prose that performs rather than analyzes the victims' point of view. Friedländer's innovation has particularly radical consequences for the construction of historical explanations. On the one hand, Friedländer explicitly argues that anti-Semitism was the single most important cause of the Holocaust. On the other hand, his transnational, multifaceted history of the "Final Solution" provides a wealth of data that escapes the conceptual grasp of his explicit model of causation. Friedländer chooses this radically self-reflexive strategy of historical representation to impress on the reader the existential sense of disbelief with which the victims experienced Nazi persecution. To Friedländer, that sense of disbelief constitutes the most appropriate ethical response to the Holocaust. Thus the narratological analysis of The Years of Extermination reveals that the exceptional quality of the book, as well as presumably its success, is the result of an extraordinarily creative act of narrative imagination. Or, put into terms developed by White, who shares Friedländer's appreciation of modernist forms of writing, The Years of Extermination is the first modernist history of the Holocaust that captures, through literary figuration, an important and long neglected reality of the "Final Solution."<br>

Publisher: Taylor and Francis Group<br>
Issue: i25597427<br>
Date: 2 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Tourage Mahdi<br>
Abstract: This paper is a phenomenological study of one of Simin Behbahani's better known poems, "Raqqaseh," which is about the nightly ritualized dance of a dancing girl in a tavern. It will argue that the tavern in this poem could be viewed as a cultural container for socially dangerous representations and impulses, like the metaphoric sexualized body of the dancing girl. The tavern could also be viewed as a semiotic register for the symbolic representation of the dominant normative social discourse. By viewing the dance as performance, the communicative association of the symbolic significance of the dancing girl's body and the tavern and its audience will also be discussed. This paper will argue that the reader too is implicated in the performative function of the text.<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The kind of phenomenology that can be useful to theology will be a hermeneutical phenomenology, one that takes us beyond the Cartesian/Husserlian ideal of presuppositionless intuition. It will also be a phenomenology of inverse intentionality, one in which the constituting subject is constituted by the look and the voice of another. In light of these suggestions, the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion is defended against three critiques, namely that it compromises the boundary between phenomenology and theology, that the theology it serves is a bad one to boot, and that it has an inadequate account of the subject. At the heart of this defense is Marion's clear distinction between phenomenology as a description of possible experience, and theology as the claim that a certain kind of experience, namely revelation or epiphany, is not merely actual but veridical. Phenomenology says, If revelation occurs it will be in the form of a saturated phenomenon. Theology says, for example, the burning bush was an epiphany, or Jesus Christ is a revelation. The attentive reader should have no trouble distinguishing Marion's phenomenological analyses, which should be persuasive to believer and unbeliever alike, from his theological claims. Marion's account of the subject falls under the heading of inverse intentionality, and there are hints that vision is aufgehoben in the voice. The seer is first of all the one seen, but above all the one addressed, called forth into response-able being.<br>

Publisher: Society of Spanish and Spanish-American Studies<br>
Issue: i27741343<br>
Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Fajardo Salvador J.<br>
Abstract: The present essay examines the ideological implications of Luis Cernuda's "Ninfa y pastor por Ticiano." In the Poem Cernuda uses ekphrasis as a springboard for the exploration of creative desire, transforming Titian's painting into an erotic generator of creativity. The erotic center of the painting—the nymph's form—becomes a mirror in whose light are reflected and merged the speaker's, Titian's, and the reader's creative desires. Starting from a position of radical dissent, the poem critiques canonical visual values with respect to the viewing subject, moral values as expressed and represented by the Christian story of man/woman's creation, and, more widely, by producing a deviation of readerly desire, it critiques the traditional codes of control and power relations in which we are immersed.<br>

Issue: i27797773<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Heinze Carsten<br>
Abstract: The article focuses on autobiographical reflection in relation to the subjective interpretation of contemporary history in written and edited autobiographies. It initially assumes that autobiographical writing and its interpretation are a sociocommunicative act as addressed to an "implied reader". Autobiographies therefore need to be observed from the perspective of the contemporary background. Against the background of literary criticism which questions the principles of the autobiographical genre, the described sociological assumption is theoretically disputed and related to history and memory building. Thus the article asks how contemporary history is constructed within a narrative and shaped by individual experiences in terms of temporary discourse. From this perspective, autobiographies are a result of contemporary history merging with the authors' personal viewpoints.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330179<br>
Date: 3 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Spencer Jonathan<br>
Abstract: This article reviews the recent interest in the literary aspects of ethnographic writing, concentrating on the work of Geertz, Sperber and the authors associated with the collective volume Writing culture. While it is argued that serious questions are raised in some of this work, it is also argued that recent fashions in literary critical theory may prove unhelpful in addresing those questions. In particular, the tendency to read texts with little or no consideration for the social and historical context in which they were written seems an especially barren approach. Instead it is argued that anthropology is as much a way of working-a kind of practical activity-as it is a way of writing. Acknowledgement of the personal element in the making of ethnographic texts may help the reader to a better assessment of the interpretation on offer; more radical change requires a change in anthropological practice as well as in anthropological writing.<br>

Article Title: Meta-Interpretation and Hypertext Fiction: A Critical Response<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i30204873<br>
Date: 2 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Gardner Colin<br>
Abstract: Traditional discourses upon literature have been predicated upon the ability to refer to a text that others may consult (Landow, 1994, p. 33). Texts that involve elements of feedback and nontrivial decision-making on the part of the reader (Aarseth, 1997, p. 1) therefore present a challenge to readers and critics alike. Since a persuasive case has been made against a critical method that sets out to "identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and territorial mastery" (Aarseth, p. 87), this paper proposes the use of readers in an empirically based approach to hypertext fiction. Meta-interpretation, a method that combines individual responses to a text, reading logs, screen recordings and limited qualitative/quantitative analysis, and critical interpretation is outlined. By analysing readers' responses it is possible to suggest both the ways that textual elements may have influenced or determined readers' choices and the ways that readers' choices "configure" the text. The method thus addresses Espen Aarseth's concerns and illuminates interesting features of interactive processes in fictional environments. The paper is divided into two parts: the first part sketches out meta-interpretation through consideration of the main problems confronting the literary critic; the second part describes reading research aimed at generating data for the literary critic.<br>

Article Title: Re-making the Georgic Connection: Virgil and Willa Cather's "My Ántonia"<br>
Publisher: Transaction Periodicals Consortium<br>
Issue: i30224118<br>
Date: 4 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Simons Karen<br>
Abstract: Willa Cather's famous Virgilian epigraph to My Ántonia alerts the reader to the novel's deep engagement with the Georgics. This paper advocates a positive interpretation of the relationship between the two by exploring the role of the poem in the life and "memoirs" of Jim Burden, the novel's narrator. In contrast to currently received notions about the poem's "pastoralizing" influence, it argues that the Georgics illumines the Nebraska prairie and the farmers who toiled there, enabling Jim to perceive and articulate their vitality and worth. Through Jim's story of remembrance and return, Cather ultimately presents the literary tradition, and the Georgics in particular, as a beneficent force capable of creating connections among human beings, the natural world, the past and present.<br>

Article Title: Exemplary Lives: Form and Function in Pure Land Sacred Biography<br>
Publisher: Nanzan Institute of Religion and Culture<br>
Issue: i30233809<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Bathgate Michael<br>
Abstract: As a literature of exemplars, Pure Land sacred biography presents the reader with the ideals of a community as much as the events of individual lives. The models for the religious life advanced in sacred biographies, however, include not only the religious practices of their protagonists, but the discursive practices of their authors, as well. The work of biography, after all, is concerned not only with depicting characters and events, but with configuring both in a meaningful form. Through a comparative reading of ōjōden and myōkōninden, this study explores some of the ways in which changes in literary form encourage different perspectives on the nature of time, causality, and community in the constitution of the religious life. These exemplary orientations to the religious life, I suggest, are a fundamental aspect of the didactic functions of these texts, and thus of their contribution to the history of Pure Land religious imagination.<br>

Article Title: Reader, Writer, and Holocaust Literature: The Case of Ka-Tzetnik<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i30245669<br>
Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Glasner-Heled Galia<br>
Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Article Title: If Meaning Is Constructed, What Is It Made from? Toward a Cultural Theory of Reading<br>
Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i368708<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yaroshevsky Peter<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the "transactional zone." The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>

Author(s): McLaughlin Heidi<br>
Abstract: While a number of theorists have investigated the various facets of narrative time and tempo, few appear to have done so within the context of reader-response theory and criticism. The third of six lectures that Umberto Eco gave at Harvard University in the winter of 1992-93 focused on how an author can shape time and thus influence the reader's pace through the narrative. This article uses Eco's tool of exploration-the narrative stopwatch-to measure the narrative tempi in three novels by three late twentieth-century authors, Manuel Puig, Jean-Renaud Camus, and Italo Calvino, showing how each author influences the pace of the reader.<br>

Author(s): Ricœur François<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricœur l'affirmait presque clandestinement depuis un demi-siècle. Voilà qu'il le répète, hautement et avec de bien meilleures chances d'être entendu, dans un livre très important pour l'avenir. Oui, en histoire on peut tenter d'atteindre le vrai par l'écriture. Oui, raconter c'est déjà expliquer et maîtriser le temps. Oui, l'événement engendre lui-même du sens, la mémoire peut être heureuse, le passé palpite dans le temps présent. Ricœur donne (redonne?) ainsi espoir à l'historien, dont le travail "rend nos attentes plus déterminées et notre expérience plus indéterminée". François Dosse dit l'opportunité de ce "moment Ricœur". L'occasion est enfin offerte à la communauté historienne d'un vrai dialogue avec la philosophie grâce à la publication de l'ouvrage majeur de Paul Ricœur, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. Ce n'est pas la premiére fois que Ricœur tente ce dialogue avec les historiens puisque sa première intervention dans ce domaine remonte à un demi-siècle. Elle fut peu entendue en un temps, les années 1950, peu propice aux épistémologies métisses. Sa trilogie sur le temps parue entre 1983 et 1985, "Temps et récit" eut un peu plus d'échos, mais elle fut pour l'essentiel tenue en lisière, considérée comme œuvre pour philosophes. Cette fois, en ce "temps des doutes" et d'interrogation des historiens sur les notions qu'ils utilisent au quotidien dans leur pratique: la vérité, la causalité, la mémoire, le récit, le temps, le moment semble venu de prendre la dimension de l'apport de Ricœur à la discipline historique, d'autant qu'il a fait, avec la rigueur qu'on lui connaît, le détour par les travaux des historiens d'aujourd'hui, dont il est le lecteur attentif. /// Now is the moment for a real dialogue with philosophy with the historian community thanks to the publication of the major work of Paul Ricœur, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. This is not the first time that Ricœur has attempted this dialogue with historians since his first intervention in this area ~<br>

Abstract: Michel Tournier is the most controversial French writer alive today. His fiction has provided fertile ground for diverse, often conflicting theoretical practices, and sharpened critiques, yet the author himself has remained aloof and is often perplexed at the way in which his work is received. Focusing on one story from Le Médianoche amoureux (1989), this article records a quest for the essential Tournier. Under the auspices of a master narrator, the reader of "Pyrotechnie" embarks on a voyage of discovery, which is ultimately one of self-discovery, for it finishes, delightfully, in the story-telling world of the child.<br>

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i40014889<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Lin Zhang<br>
Abstract: Judging Gadamer's theoretical stance is a complicated matter, and his ontological hermeneutics is usually regarded as a text-centered theory of understanding. Through an analysis of the phenomenological premises from which his theories take off, however, we can clearly see his reader-centric stance. On the basis of this stance some cease to seek for the original intention of the author or the original meaning of the text, which ineluctably leads to the ignorance of an understanding methodology. As far as people's intentional understanding is concerned, however, the important as well as essential task is still that of striving for a certain kind of understanding that is relatively correct, with universally effective methodology as its necessary prerequisite. What is more, herein lies the significance of the epistemology of hermeneutics. This article aims to re-insert a sense of methodology after hermeneutics went through a period of ontological reflection, and hence clarify that it is of necessity that hermeneutics resumes its text-centric methodological stance. /// 判定加达默尔的理论立场是一个复杂的问题。他的本体论诠释学一般被视为 一种文本中心论的理解理论，然而通过对他所从出发的现象学前提之分析，可以清 楚地看出他的读者中心论的立场.正是基于这一立场，放弃了对作者原意或文本原 义之诉求，必然导致对理解方法论的漠视。但是，就人们有意识的理解活动而言， 首要的以及根本的任务仍然是努力获得某种相对正确的理解，而普遍有效的方法论 就是其必要的前提，诠释学的认识论意义便在于此.在诠释学经历了本体论的反思 后，应重新注入一种方法论的意识，回到以文本为中心的方法论立场.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i40026609<br>
Date: 4 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Klein Michael L.<br>
Abstract: This article discusses irony both as a narrative archetype in tonal music and as an interpretative strategy on the part of the listener. Beginning with a discussion of Northrop Frye's four narrative archetypes (romance, comedy, tragedy, irony), the article turns to a semiotic interpretation of the archetypes by James Liszka and an application of that work for music analysis by Byron Almén. Arguing that ironic narratives in tonal music often take as their premise a topical field associated with romance or comedy that leads to an unexpected failure, the article also claims that our interpretation of musical narratives must be invested in the semantic level (topics, codes, conventions, genres) as well as the syntactic one (harmony, voice leading). The four archetypes function as structures of the musical text and as master signifiers that the listener uses to organize an interpretation. As such, the archetypes function as ideologies of the musical text and as ideologies of the reader. The article illustrates these ideas with analyses of Chopin's Nocturne in B, op. 32/1, Chopin's Second Ballade, and Brahms's Rhapsody in Ek op. 119/4.<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i40028027<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Armstrong Andrew H.<br>
Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: By calling his Op. 132 Märchenerzählungen, whose redundant title means something akin to « telling tales », Robert Schumann seems to have wished to redouble the narrative dimension of the work, composed 1853. As a well informed reader of literature and poetry, Schumann often used literary models to conceive both form and content in his music. This article demonstrates how, in the third of his Märchenerzählungen, Schumann himself becomes a teller of tales.<br>

Abstract: Nous nous proposons ici de réfléchir à la question suivante : Comment expliquer le fait que les fondateurs du « programme fort », Barry Bames et David Bloor, insistent depuis quelques années pour dire qu'ils n'ont jamais nié l'influence de la « réalité » sur la formation des connaissances scientifiques et qu'en fait ils ont été mal compris de leurs lecteurs ? Alors que Bloor tente d'expliquer les malentendus en les situant complètement du côté du récepteur, en invoquant une loi psychologique dite de « conventionalisation » proposée par Frederic Charles Bartlett, nous voulons esquisser ici une explication complémentaire qui se situe du côté de l'émetteur et prend au sérieux la structure argumentaire des textes. We propose in this paper to answer the following question : How can we explain the fact that the founders of the « Strong Program », Barry Bames and David Bloor, insisted, over the last couple of years, to say that they have never denied the role played by « reality » in the construction of scientific knowledge, and thus have been misunderstood by their readers ? Whereas Bloor explains these misunderstandings by invoking a psychological law of « conventionalization » due to Frederic Charles Bartlett, thus locating the source of the problem on the receiver's (reader's) side, we suggest here a complementary explanation taking into account the argumentative structure of the text itself, hence situating the origin of the confusion on the writer's side.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: The short novel, Will-o'-the-Wisp ('Het dwaallicht') by the Antwerpian (Belgian) author Willem Elsschot, narrates how one night Laarmans, a somewhat tired middle-aged husband and father, accompanies three Afghan seamen on a search for a woman, Maria Van Dam. The search leads them through the harbouring city, and ultimately fails. The work is enigmatic and invites the reader to engage with it creatively, adventurously and not without commitment. The reader discovers in this way not only what it means to interpret, but also that by questioning one's own contribution in the understanding of being, interpretation serves as a challenge to clarify one's existence. The enigma of Will-o'-the-Wisp is never solved, but the search for understanding what happened during that nightly search provides a model for every practical methodology of hermeneutics, and can therefore be considered a parable about the nature of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative, based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The article highlights the structural features of narrative—basically, the organization of the genre around the semantic template actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet, such as time and space of action—and shows how to implement this structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism, 1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from Newton to Goethe—and the quality versus quantity debate—to Goethe and Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose d'explorer les enjeux d'une écriture romanesque contemporaine définie comme douleur fantôme de l'histoire et exercice de ses mémoires possibles: deux séries complémentaires d'exemples – liées pour l'une à la réinvention d'une mémoire du bourreau par un narrateur « sosie » de l'historien (Manuel Vázquez Montalbán et Jonathan Littell), et pour l'autre à la saisie de l'historicité des temps présents sous l'angle conjoint de la mélancolie et de l'ironie (David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon et Dubravka Ugrešić) – permettent d'éclairer l'ambition romanesque de transcription de l'histoire dans l'exercice « à-présent » (ou « au temps-maintenant » , selon l'expression de Walter Benjamin) de ses mémoires possibles. En courant le risque d'une rivalité ou d'une confusion trompeuse entre les statuts du discours historiographique et du récit romanesque, et en s'exposant à la récusation par le lecteur de sa légitimité en la matière, le roman contemporain choisit de s'établir dans les plis du savoir historien et ainsi d'engager ses moyens propres dans l'entreprise d'une écriture en palimpseste du texte virtuel, ou idéal, de l'expérience historique. This article sets out to investigate those aspects of the contemporary novel in which fiction writing delves into the ghost pains of history and experiments with its would-be memories. Two sets of complementary examples will allow us to shed light on this particular novelistic ambition, i.e. transcribing history into a "to-day" (or "now-time", to use a phrase coined by Walter Benjamin) experimentation with its virtual memories. The first set of texts (by Manuel Vázquez Montalbán and Jonathan Littell) illustrates the reinvention of the executioner's memory courtesy of a narrator passing himself for a double of the historian. The second series of novels (by David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon and Dubravka Ugrešić) features several attempts to grasp the historical quality of present times at the articulation of melancholy and ~<br>

Author(s): Roe Glenn H.<br>
Abstract: A fierce opponent of the historicist approach to literature that dominated French academe during his lifetime, the essayist and poet Charles Péguy (1873–1914) would theorize an alternative literary method that through the act of faithful and participatory reading could transcend the limitations of historicism. Outlined in his dialogue with History, Clio, Péguy's vision of the literary act is that of an intersubjective operation of mutual understanding between reader and author, in which the living relevance of literary works extends beyond their narrow historical origins; a conception that prefigures the formalist and hermeneutic literary approaches that will arise decades later.<br>

Author(s): Van der Poel Reinier<br>
Abstract: Erasmus's writings on marriage, such as the Praise of Marriage, the Institution of Christian Marriage, and several of the Colloquies, have long been studied from a social-intellectual perspective that focuses on their role within theological debates of the time. This article proposes a different approach by stressing the literary and rhetorical aspects by which these texts seek to influence a reader in his or her "matrimonial praxis." Through the combination of an effective rhetoric of intimacy with the characteristics of literary dialogue, Erasmus creates a mimetic discourse aimed at conveying models of conjugal life to be imitated by future readers.<br>

Author(s): Levinas C. Fred<br>
Abstract: How best to avoid the Levinas Effect, as it has been called, the tendency to make Emmanuel Levinas everything to everyone? One way is to demonstrate that Levinas's thinking does not fit into any of the categories by which we ordinarily approach political theory. If one were forced to categorize Levinas's political theory, the term "inverted liberalism " would come closest to the mark. As long, that is, as one emphasizes the term "inverted" over "liberalism." Levinas's defense of liberalism is likely the strangest defense the reader has encountered. We should, argues Levinas, foster and protect the individual because only the individual can see the tears of the other, the tears that even the just regime cannot see. The individual is to be fostered and protected for the sake of the other individual. Whether this has anything to do with "real" liberalism, and whether it should, is the topic of this essay.<br>

Abstract: The issue is the manner in which the reading of literature can constitute an everyday existential resource, without construing this use of reading in an excessively instrumental manner. The key resides in the formal characters rendering a literary element notable, memorable, and/or quotable, both privately and collectively, inasmuch as the orientation of these elements is the becoming of the reader(s), not their past. La question est celle de la façon dont la littérature peut représenter une ressource dans la vie quotidienne, sans concevoir un tel usage de la lecture littéraire comme purement instrumental. Un tel usage de la lecture se trouve lorsque les caractéristiques formelles qui rendent, individuellement ou collectivement, notable, mémorable ou citable tel ou tel passage littéraire s'accompagnent d'une orientation vers l'avenir du lecteur, et non vers la rétrospection.<br>

It poses the problems as two related questions: what is the "objective" meaning of the notion of the Solarian ocean for the Solarist researchers in the novel, and what is the "symbolic" meaning of the novel's fantastic ocean for its readers. Since the diegetic planet Solaris has no objective relation to the meaning-producing dynamics of human work, the Solarian ocean is a projection of familiar human meanings. As for the fantastic ocean represented for the reader, it can be approached via several semantic interpretations, none of which are fully adequate. Three such approaches are the plasmatic, i.e., the different descriptions of the ocean are instances of the dominant metasemic lexeme "plasma"; the vaginal, i.e., the ocean is a displaced image of female sexuality; and the schizophrenic, i.e., the ocean is an instance of a schizophrenic "miraculation-machine" (derived from Deleuze-Guattari's Anti-Oedipus).<br>

Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>

Author(s): Bishop Edward L.<br>
Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>

Author(s): van Alphen Ernst<br>
Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: A survey of recent books on Reader-Response, broadly defined as any literary theory that investigates the process of reading. This includes not only books by Norman Holland, Stanley Fish, and Wolfgang Iser, long regarded as central figures in the area of Reader-Response, but also discussions of the contribution to this area made by Jacques Derrida and Mikhail Bakhtin. A widespread reaction is observed against the impersonality of much literary theory and the dangers of reducing reading to a science, but alternative models that stress the therapeutic, self-enhancing, or playful elements in reading are also exposed to critical analysis.<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that historical interpretation of the New Testament is necessary to provide information for setting the parameters of valid readings of the New Testament. Such an interpretation serves the purpose of alienation between reader and text and enables the interpreter to ask critical questions about the communicability and relevance of these texts. The nature of the New Testament necessitates historical interpretation. Current historico-critical interpretation of the New Testament is discussed and evaluated with a view to possibilities and limitations in the light of current developments in literary science, history of philosophy and historiography.<br>

Abstract: The effect of a metaphor is based on a shift in expectancy and cannot be established in advance. Various proposals on the meaning of παιδαγωγός are considered in the light of Paul's argumentative strategy in Galatians 3. In the light of this strategy it is evident that Paul uses this metaphor to indicate the temporary and captive nature of the situation under the law. As a persuasive strategy this metaphor provides the reader with an unexpected view on the function of the law, as well as their own position, urging them to return to 'his' gospel.<br>

Abstract: In a first part, the article tells the story of the Hermeneutics Group of the NTSSA. It is a story with three phases. In the first phase, interpretation was seen as more than the application of methods. In the second phase, the active role of the reader became more important. In the third phase, the importance of interpretive communities became more apparent. In a second part, some of the issues resulting from these developments are discussed under the rubric 'Why do we interpret the New Testament?' In a third part, the question is raised whether the Hermeneutics Group (and the NTSSA?) may be entering a new phase in its scholarly activity of dialogue with other reader-communities.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this article is that the process of 'reading' (or constructing) a context is somehow analogous to the process of reading a text. The tools, concepts and categories developed in literary criticism to read texts may therefore be helpful for New Testament scholars' endevours to find ways and means to read context(s). Following a reflection on different possible conseptualisations of text and context, the notion of 'reading the context' is considered in the rest of the article on two levels: (i) the distinction between 'critic' and 'reader' in literary criticism is related to the distinction between 'emic' and 'etic' perspectives in cultural criticism, and (ii) the applicability of W Iser's phenomenological discription of the reading process for cultural criticism is considered and related to R Schreiter's methodological proposal for 'listening to cultures'.<br>

Abstract: An investigation into poets' creative use of the Christian Bible reveals that receptions of the Bible as an imaginative text play an important role in what is achieved in such poems. The article will deal with a coherent group of poems by Antjie Krog, Die Jerusalemgangers, in a volume titled Jerusalemgangers (1985). It consists of eight different poems grouped into three sections. Voices from many centuries echo in these poems. The central theme is developed through four main perspectives, namely a male leader, a 'black consciousness' voice, a woman visionary and the all-embracing and composing perspective of the poet as visionary which incorporates the perspectives of other South African literary voices. This central theme concerns the universal quest for a Utopia, in these poems with their religiously conscious speakers, Utopia is presented in the Biblical imagery of a new Jerusalem. The creative process is activated as each voice, in its pursuit of an imaginary ideal context, uses the same text as a guiding principle on its 'journey' towards 'liberation'. The poet juxtaposes ideological readings of the Christian Bible, directed by different experiences of the South African context. The poet's vision clearly becomes a voice among others and yet it functions as a composing factor. This leads to commenting secular texts entering into the discourse. In the poetic text structuring and linguistic principles can lead to aesthetic insights into ostensibly unreconciled elements. The reading of the poems presented in this article will be directed by such poetic conventions. An attempt will be made to identify the signifying role of the poet's response to the Biblical imagery. The reader's response to these poems is likewise influenced by an acquaintance with the Bible.<br>

Article Title: BREAD FOR THE BROKEN: PRAGMATIC MEANING OF MARK 14:22-25<br>

Abstract: This article interprets Mark 14:22-25, using one of the new approaches in biblical interpretation, namely, pragmatic analysis. In pragmatic analysis, a text is considered a linguistic unit composed of linguistic elements (signs) with the scope of communicating a message. Interpretation involves examining the linguistic elements, the relationship between them (the syntax), their semantic valence in view of their communicative potentiality. Reading Mark 14:22-25 with this approach leads us to the conclusion that the evangelist included the institution account in his Gospel primarily to explain the significance and effect of Jesus' death to the reader. By adequately preparing the reader on the power of the word of Jesus before coming to read the institution account, Mark achieves a rhetorical effect: the conviction of the power of the words of Jesus and an admiration for the generosity of Jesus. This elicits in the reader an attraction to enter into Jesus' covenant.<br>

Abstract: Are the readings of Luke being proposed in this volume evidence of readers finding in the text what they want? Different readings of the same text can be related to different manifestations of "the reader". Yet a responsible reading of the text implies taking the text as a speech-act functioning in a communicative context. The role of the author and the context therefore becomes important again. The concept of foolproof composition is relevant too ās it implies the exclusion of the possibility of a counterreading of the text. Tlie phenomenon of the inspiration of a sacred text also functions as a constraint.<br>

Abstract: The different "readings and readers" are evaluated, with a view to responsible hermeneutics, on three levels. First, the question is asked as to whether the different readings took place in a responsible way in terms of their own presuppositions and goals. Some general remarks are made on the possible comparison and integration of these readings are made. Second, the question is asked whether some of these readings are more appropriate, responsible or legitimate readings of literature than others. The point is argued that such an evaluation cannot be timeless and abstract, but will depend on the purpose of the reader. Third, the question is asked how the specific pencope, namely a text from the Christian New Testament, can be responsibly read by New Testament scholars.<br>

Abstract: The use of metaphor, transposed from small to large units of speech is analogical to the structuralist transfer of the laws of language organisation from units of levels below the sentence to units of an order above or equal to the sentence. The metaphor can be defined as a word in counterdetermining context. The unconventional contextual use of the metaphoric term creates a tension which can be explained in terms of the interaction view of metaphor. The metaphor functions as a contextual filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the principal subject by implying statements about it that normally apply to the subsidiary subject. The contextualisation of a text can be defined as a text in counter-determining context. The tension between text and contemporary context or discourse is reminiscent of the tension between vehicle and frame in the metaphor. The contextualisation functions as contextual filter of the text which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the context or discourse by implying statements about it that normally apply to the text in its conventional or original context or discourse. As an activity, the metaphor, as well as the contextualisation has socio-political significance since it is determined by the discourse of the reader or contextualiser.<br>

Abstract: The explication of contextualisation in terms of metaphor theory facilitates the utilisation of procedures of literary analysis, the idea of the model reader of a text, as well as the social analysis of discourses for the explication of the contextualisation of a text. The explication of the interaction between text and reader, or contextualiser in terms of metaphor theory explains some of the complexities involved in reading or contextualising texts. In the metaphoric interaction between text and reader the activity of contextualisation functions as a contextual or situational filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the discourse of the reader, implying statements about it that normally apply to the text. As a text in counter-determining context, the text is retroactively determined by the discourse which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the text, implying statements about it that normally apply to the discourse or context.<br>

Author(s): Conan Michel<br>
Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Author(s): Schäfer Stefanie<br>
Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Author(s): Glicksohn Joseph<br>
Abstract: In attempting to achieve some form of mapping between consciousness (specifically, consciousness₆) and cognition, I distinguish between a weak and a strong version of the hypothesis, indicating a change in mode of thinking of a metaphoric-symbolic nature (Glicksohn, 1993). The weak version would claim that metaphors, symbols, analogies and images are used in an attempt to depict the experience, which is not easily translatable into words. The strong version would claim that metaphoric thinking is one of the hallmarks of the experience, and is used both in an attempt to depict the experience and also to convey to the reader, and possibly to induce in the reader, some of the qualities of that experience. My discussion of these two options is preceded by some comments on problems inherent in studying altered or alternate states of consciousness. I also discuss the relationships among physiognomic perception, cognitive dedifferentiation, and symbolic cognition.<br>

Abstract: This article looks at the short stories of Saadat Hasan Manto in Urdu about the Partition and of Orkeny, a Hungarian Jewish writer about the Holocaust and finds that by adopting a critical distance both Manto and Orkeny were able to evolve narrative strategies which invited the readers' response and stimulated agency. By countering moralising and sentimentality in their narrative strategies they enabled the reader to deal with and go beyond the paralysing effects of such traumatic experiences.<br>

Mais, de l'autre, le lecteur ne peut oublier que de larges sections décrivent les coutumes et l'espace de nombreux peuples dès que la conquête les menace. Cette dynamique s'enracine dans les conditions matérielles de création et de lecture au Ve siècle avant J.-C, et dans les héritages narratifs que transforme Hérodote (Vies, Catalogues ...). Or aucun conquérant n'est glorifié ni présenté comme un vainqueur, tandis que les peuples visés opposent la singularité de leur espace et l'étrangeté de leurs coutumes, soit un genre de vie devenu stratégie de résistance, en associant particularisme insulaire et fuite calculée sur le modèle nomade. Les Grecs, de même, tantôt conquérants insatiables mais défaits, tantôt résistants invaincus, contribuent à monter que, chez Hérodote, l'autre a le visage de celui qui résiste plutôt que du Barbare. Il s'agit donc bien d'une autre écriture du passé, qui sauve de l'oubli tous les peuples décrits, non les seuls hauts faits des Rois. Les mêmes images sont employées pour décrire la résistance insulaire des nomades, et pour dire le cheminement de l'écriture, ainsi en relation d'homologie avec son objet. On one hand, Herodotus' Inquiry reports the plan of domination which from Croesus to Xerxes composes the system of the relation between Greeks and Barbarians, from 561 to 479. But on the other hand, the reader cannot forget that large sections describe customs and many people's area when they are threatened by conquest. This discrepancy has its roots in the material conditions of creativity and reading in the fifth century B.C., and to the narrative forms available to Herodotus (Lives, Lists...). However, no conqueror was praised nor spoken of as a victor, while people shown opposed their individual space and their peculiar customs, that is to say a way of life set up as a stra~<br>

Abstract: This essay redefines the task of the reader in light of Christian hope, unfolding how a theology of hope might ground literary criticism. The resulting approach to literature—hopeful reading—considers texts in light of their future becoming in the Kingdom of God. Rather than considering texts as purveyors of hope or possibility for a readers future, hopeful reading asks critics to non-instrumentally foreground the possibilities in a text's future. The essay explains Christian hope, shows how it might warrant and construct a literary critic's vocation, and offers several extended examples of contemporary critics who seem to be reading hopefully.<br>

Abstract: Issu des recherches d'une quinzaine d'exégètes, cet ouvrage, de style universitaire, est destiné à présenter à un large public un panorama des recherches johanniques contemporaines. Très diversifié quant aux thèmes abordés, il introduira lectrices et lecteurs aux questions irrésolues que pose l'histoire des communautés johanniques et de leur production littéraire. De nombreux auteurs s'interrogent sur la signification des relectures et des retouches successives. Ainsi, l'ouvrage rejoint l'aspect le plus énigmatique du corpus johannique (évangile et épîtres). Les écrits johanniques ont été dès l'origine et demeurent au centre de conflits d'interprétations; de ces conflits, comme des hypothèses les plus diverses, le livre a le mérite de rendre compte. Ainsi, il se montre digne de figurer parmi les ouvrages de référence sur ce sujet. This collection, the work of fifteen exegetes and edited by Kaestli, Poffet and Zumstein, presents a panorama of contemporary Johannine research for the benefit of the larger public. Touching upon many themes, it introduces the reader to the unresolved questions concerning the Johannine communities and their literature. Several authors question the significance of rereadings and successive alterations, the most enigmatic aspect of the Johannine corpus (gospel and epistles). The collection has the merit of presenting the diverse hypothesis and conflicts of interpretation to which Johannine writings have always been exposed, and should figure amongst the works of reference on the subject.<br>

Publisher: IMPRIMERIE ATAR S.A.<br>
Issue: i40182120<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Müller Denis<br>
Abstract: L'auteur esquisse la relation de l'utilitarisme et du christianisme sous l'angle triple des rapports entre le bien et le salut, le sacrifice et le sujet, la souffrance réduite ou affrontée. Le trépied ainsi proposé ne constitue pas une cage de fer, à laquelle toute comparaison et toute lecture devraient se soumettre ou se refuser, mais seulement une possible structure de dialogue et de débat, devant faciliter et fructifier l'interpellation réciproque de la morale utilitariste et de l'éthique chrétienne. The author sketches the link of utilitarianism and Christianity on three bases : the relation of goodness and faith ; of sacrifice and the individual, of suffering denied and suffering met. This three-legged stool is not an iron cage meant to be accepted or rejected by the reader, but only a possible framework for dialogue designed to allow the mutual questioning of utilitarian morals and Christian ethics.<br>

Author(s): Bühler Pierre<br>
Abstract: En travaillant sur quelques reprises littéraires des récits de la Passion du Christ, l'article tente de montrer comment la relecture littéraire permet de redécouvrir la manière dont les textes bibliques interpellent leurs lectrices et lecteurs. En particulier, il s'attache à faire apparaître comment certains personnages de ces récits, par la transposition littéraire, deviennent des offres fictives d'identité narrative. Pour ce faire, l'auteur se laisse guider par la théorie de la narrativité de Paul Ricoeur et la conception de l'acte de lecture de Wolfgang her. Using literary renditions of the Passion narratives, this article tries to show how literary rereadings allow us to discover the way biblical texts interpellate the reader. In particular, it seeks to bring out the way certain characters, in the literary transposition of these stories, become fictive overtures of narrative identity. The author is inspired by Paul Ricoeur's theory of narrativity and Wolfgang Iser's idea of the act of reading.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'attèle à montrer comment les notions principales de l'herméneutique de Ricœur (monde du texte/monde du lecteur, distanciation – appropriation, compréhension de soi trois mimèsis) ont permis de penser de façon systématique la question du statut du texte biblique et de sa traduction dans un mémoire de licence de la Faculté de théologie de Neuchâtel, réalisé en 2006. Après une présentation du mémoire et de son contexte, les apports de la pensée de Ricœur sont énumérés en quatre points : la théorie de la traduction, la notion de lecture non utilisatrice, la notion de canon et celle de «texte inspiré». This article sets out to show how the principal notions of Ricoeur's hermeneutics (the textual world/the reader's world, distantiation - appropriation, self-comprehension, three mimesis) made possible a systematic exposition of the question of the status of biblical text and its translation in a licentiate thesis at the Faculty of Theology of Neuchâtel, in 2006. Once the thesis and its context are presented, the contributions of Ricoeur's ideas are enumerated in four points: translation theory, the notions of nonuser readings, of canonicity, and of «inspired text».<br>

Abstract: The frames that Lewis Carroll provided for the two Alice books have largely been ignored, when not simply dismissed, in recent Carroll criticism. Their conventional form and diction may account for this negative response, but examination of their provenance, their function within the structure of the two books, and the artistry evident in the individual frame components indicate how and why the frames are important to our understanding of Carroll's vision and purpose. The frame poems are designed to lead the reader into and away from the central dream tales through a process of lyric transformation and estrangement.<br>

Article Title: Epiphany and Browning: Character Made Manifest<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219810<br>
Date: 10 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Wordsworth Herbert F.<br>
Abstract: The fortunes of epiphany indicate both recent historical disparities within literary criticism and current cultural disparities between academic and popular discourse. The contextualist practice of Wordsworth and Joyce, in contrast to the purist theory that arose with the New Criticism, suggests that epiphany is a narrative device underscoring the historical and cultural construction of character. This conception is borne out by the original Epiphany, in Matthew, which manifests divine personality to human eyes through an episode of cultural difference and accommodation. Robert Browning's historicist poetry uses comparable but secular means of manifesting personality. In his dramatic monologues "Karshish," "My Star," and " 'Transcendentalism,' " epiphanic themes serve as measures of their speakers' cultural construction. In discerning the relative differentiae that characterize such speakers, Browning's readers encounter their own relativity to interpretive conditions. As these examples imply, the modern literary epiphany ultimately effects the hermeneutic manifestation of the reader.<br>

Author(s): Selzer Greg<br>
Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Abstract: The new information technologies have transformed reading practices in meaningful ways, promoting other skills and competences, and activating new ways of interacting with reading devices. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Mexico City, this article aims to explore how communicational innovations have had an impact on a specific type of reader, whose distinctive feature is to have an intense and/or enjoyable relationship with the act of read: the cultural creators. The analysis of these practices and the reflection as a result of this, allows us to observe that, far from creating isolated readers, the emerging technologies contribute to develop, in other ways,the potential for the sociability of reading, thus stimulating work networks and collaborative projects.<br>

Abstract: David Jenkins persistently recommended that in reading the Bible the reader has always to ask ‘How did people think then which led them to put it like that?’ He provided the following as an example. The writers of the gospels lived at a time when demon possession was the available conceptuality if a person fell to the ground writhing and foaming at the mouth. In the Middle Ages, the conceptuality within which explanation arose was that of the humours of the body and the cure would have been blood-letting. In medicalized 21st century conceptuality, it would be said that the person was having an epileptic fit and the needed response is to keep calm and re-assure.<br>

Abstract: ‘[..] the necessary stage between structural explanation and self-understanding is the unfolding of the world of the text; it is the latter that finally forms and transforms the reader’s being-a-self in accordance with his or her intention. The theological implication of this is considerable: the primary task of a hermeneutics is not to bring about a decision in the reader but first to allow the world of being that is the “thing” of the biblical text to unfold’,

Abstract: The longstanding critical refrain that Virginia Woolf's fiction represents a turn ““inward”” to the vagaries of the inner life has more recently been countered with an ““outward”” approach emphasizing Woolf's interest in the material world, its everyday objects and their social and political significance. Yet one of the most curious and pervasive features of Woolf's oeuvre is that characters are so frequently wrong in their perceptions. This essay consolidates the inward and outward approaches by tracing the trope of misperception in Woolf's fiction as well as in her conceptions of the work of author and reader. For Woolf, the modern literary experience derives from the nature of the faculties of perception, the tenuous points of connection —— and disjunction —— between the inner and the outer worlds.<br>

Article Title: Lurianic Kabbalah and Its Literary Form: Myth, Fiction, History<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: pft.2009.29.issue-3<br>
Date: October 2009<br>
Author(s): Magid Shaul<br>
Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: A book proposing an overview of “African literature” is a very attractive proposition to the new reader seeking orientation in a vast and fastgrowing vibrant field, to the expert in one area looking to explore others, and perhaps also to the publisher with a canny eye to the bottom line. This essay examines the often bewildering array of apparent subcategories that emerge in some key texts published around the turn of the twentieth-first century that purport to offer an overview of African literature in French, but which seem to entirely set aside important international debates over “postcolonial,” diaspora, and hybridity, among others. These texts have an important role in the construction of knowledge of “African literature,” but their strengths and limitations become clear when we look closely at the categories suggested and no more so than when the category happens to be that of “identity.”<br>

Abstract: One poem, “After Shakespeare,” sounds particularly Shakespearean: it is the only poem in the set that draws exclusively from the Bard's lexical fields (“disloyal moon!”), so that its echoes emphasize the distance between the other sonnagrams and Shakespeare:
         
               
            For lovers oft from thee great boldness draw
               To do like acts of mutiny below;
               A tacit metamorphosis of law
               Informs their fervent antidote to woe
            
               Leftover letters are one of the hazards of the anagram machine. Mohammad explains, “Each Sonnagram, including its title, is an anagram of a standard modern-spelling version of one of Shakespeare's Sonnets, containing exactly the same letters in the same distribution as the original. The title is composed last, using whatever letters are left over once I've assembled a working sonnet in iambic pentameter with an English rhyme scheme.”(RP and F with WS [RP];
               [RP] PP with WH [VD]).
               ———
               [Sonnet 37 (“As a decrepit father takes delight”)]
            
                     
               138
                  
               Some have read the leftover letters in the concluding couplet as presenting a false encryption for the reader, linking it to Shakespeare's mysterious dedication of his sonnets in 1609 to “Mr. WH.”139
            
               The initials are also familiar to readers of modernist poetry: WS might stand in for William Shakespeare, but it might also refer to Wallace Stevens, just as WH are Auden's famous initials … But perhaps it is merely a trap to believe that decoding is possible. The point of the poem may be that knowledge of the canon, or intertextual expertise, leads only to dead ends. But if the leftover letters that stud the poem are read as recombinatory elements that follow the logic of DNA sequencing—so that language itself is a constant reproduction of combinatory possibility—the poem offer~<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Here, Jabbeh Wesley plays with elements that the listeners are very familiar with and that they can easily visualize. The personification of the Mesurado River achieves comic relief even in the midst of tragedy. Throughout the poem, a voice induces a dialogue between the river and the millions of troops—its fishes—and, taking the position of the fishes, goes on with questions, now directed at some other forces. One can imagine children chuckling at the narrative, and adults grinning, while they are all seated around the family hearth listening. The last three stanzas begin a change in tone, preparing the reader for a shocking realization. The fish, and the voice that had taken their perspective, are tired of being sent on rendezvous. One of these days the voice/fishes would be gone:
         
               
         Like a frog that cried and cried for the rain,
               and before the rains, withers beside the dried
               banks of the stream.
               I'll be gone, Mesurado, do you hear me?<br>

Abstract: Three years later in the next edition of selected SPEP papers the editors, Ronald Bruzina and Bruce Wilshire, noted an article by David Allison, “Structuralism Revisited: Levi Straus and Diachrony.”
         
               They suggested that to understand it the reader would need to draw from knowledge of Heidegger, Derrida, Deleuze, and Ricoeur. They also noted a paper by Matthieu Casalis, “Hermeneutics, Death of God, and Dissolution of the Subject: A Phenomenological Appraisal,” that indicates a growing challenge to what we could call a strong tendency toward totalization in some aspect of phenomenological thought, as well as the high stakes that are at issue. Interest in Marxist thought and critical theory as well as in social science also intensified during the 1970s, and by the end of the decade papers in these areas were common, while papers also emerged on politics and political action. The currents crossing the phenomenological mainstream were now strong and, for some members, challenging in a disconcerting way that most people in SPEP in the 1960s could not have imagined. Many people who were deeply impacted by the civil rights struggle (in spite of the absence in SPEP of a significant presence of people of color), the Vietnam War protests, and the growing awareness of colonialism and gender inequality were taking philosophy in the context of phenomenology and existentialism out of the modern transcendental and metaphysical domain, some by direct challenges to interpretations of canonical texts and others by setting new directions that arose out of contemporary problems and concern for social justice. Social-historical factors and careful analyses of narrative forms began to replace epistemology as leading interests, and these factors and forms often replaced metaphysical foundations in their work. “Humanism” became increasingly a problem rather than an unquestioned term concerning human life and the context of its interpretation.4<br>

Abstract: In this latter context one can note that both the hammer and cell phone are multistable, but in vastly different ways. Classical hammers exemplified different uses through different, largely single-style designs: carpenters' hammers, cobblers' hammers, tack hammers, sledgehammers. Cell phones are deliberately multitask designed—audio phone, text capacity, camera, GPS, bar code reader, calculator—all built into a single “handy” device.<br>

Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion is more interested in the phenomenology of religion than in ethics.
            
                  But before turning to his positive contributions, it is worth noticing a loud protest that concerns both him and Levinas, among others. In 1991 Dominique Janicaud published29
               The Theological Turn of French Phenomenology, bitterly accusing Levinas and a series of younger scholars, including Marion, of betraying phenomenology. By sneaking God into phenomenology they abandon the reduction and thereby compromise phenomenology's scientific rigor and neutrality. Speaking of Levinas, but implicitly of Marion and others,
                  he writes, “The dice are loaded and choices made; faith rises majestically in the background. The reader … finds him- or herself in the position of a catechumen who has no other choice than to penetrate the holy words and lofty dogmas…. All is acquired and imposed from the outset, and this all is no little thing: nothing less than the God of the biblical tradition. Strict treason of the reduction.”30

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: What to me is most striking about the Galen lab report is that it captures an unusually quiescent image of Shaw, a stasis that is discordant with our sense of him as a vivacious, frenetic blur during those first decades in London, what Archibald Henderson deems “the quintessence of vital energy.”
      
            Throughout most of his life, Shaw was an active walker, cyclist, and swimmer, not to mention a compulsive reader, writer, and speaker whose engagement with the world around him was marked by a robust, ferocious vigor. Shaw's use of language is itself acrobatic, his agile balancing of ideas, his graceful rhetorical athleticism across genres. In this sense, it is precisely his2
         sanus agitatusthat draws and sustains our interest, the rigor of his writing challenging us to keep up, work out, and stay in shape. In 1897, theVegetariannoted of Shaw that “in the pursuit of his duties he has to work frequently under most unhealthy conditions and to face all weathers yet any observant stranger would turn and take a second look at Shaw's virile figure in the street.”
            Indeed, more than a century later, we are still eagerly looking and, in some cases, still trying to catch up. Arguably, health was the fundamental preoccupation of Shaw's work, Shavianism's probiotic elixir the unifying thread of a prolific and expansive career.3<br>

Abstract: In the essay I adopt Tamar Yacobi's “communication model” for settling discrepancies and inconsistencies in fictional texts and use it to demonstrate that the hypothesis of unreliable narration does not necessarily entail only one kind of interpretation. To support this point, I offer the distinction between
         self-deceptiveandother-deceptivenarrating characters, and I argue that some texts constantly cause the reader to hesitate between conflicting interpretations of the narrator as belonging to one of these two types. Such equivocation on the part of the reader is then extended to competing interpretations of the text, in accordance with each type of narrator. The chosen novel for this purpose is Vladimir Nabokov'sLolita.<br>

Abstract: Most scholars dealing with unreliable narration consider the unreliable narrator inferior to the reader in either knowledge or morality. This conception implies that the readers are more reliable than the unreliable narrator and, thanks to this difference, capable of identifying unreliabilty, with no consequences or ramifications for themselves. Although this view is not entirely wrong, the readers' superiority to the narrator may change if the readers either find out new details about the narrator that urge them to reevaluate their classification or discover something new about themselves that encourages them to reconsider their superiority. An interesting combination of these two possibilities is found in Camus's novella
         The Fall(La Chute). My interpretation ofThe Fallfocuses on the triad narrator-narratee-reader and the narrator's rhetorical manipulations, maintaining that the text both undermines the binary opposition between “unreliable narrator” and “reliable reader” and has some general implications on the position of the reader towards fiction.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: “Time and History in Blake's<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.22.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: If the Utopian breaks down upon its contact with material history, then perhaps by inscribing—and, more importantly, integrating—its antithesis and its own absurdity within itself (as indeed More's
         Utopialiterally—by the argument of its first part—does), it might achieve a balance and a self-awareness sufficient to sustain it beyond the moment of its conception, the revolutionary or revelatory moment, and to translate its abstraction into the very materiality, the physical placedness, that had originally threatened to extinguish it.Finnegans Wakemay be a dream—but it is a cyclic one: one from which the reader can never awake, yet within which its ownwaking-fromis already inscribed and therefore preempted. Yet does this Viconian cyclicity refute the possibility of Utopia? Utopian historicity is necessarily progressive and teleological, rather than endlessly cyclic. But it seems that these two positions might be reconciled if we view the cycle itself as dynamically Utopian, rather than any single point in that cycle—the divine, heroic, democratic, or chaotic—as a necessary end point, a stereotypically static Utopia.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Because current usage is so confused and contradictory, each use of
         Utopiabegs for definition, not least to alert the reader to whetherUtopiais intended in itspathologicalsense of failure or totalitarianism, evident in architecture and urban projects as a requirement for total application all at once, with no opportunities for rethinking proposals (or failing that, remaining forever untested aspaper palaces), or in itsconstitutionalsense of taking the first steps toward improved physical and social conditions while also allowing for partial achievement and even significant changes to plans in the course of their realization. Claims that a visionary architectural or urban project constitutes a Utopia usually depend on descriptions woefully short of detail on how the improved setting and society promised (if one is even anticipated) might actually be achieved or function. The political naïveté and infeasibility that characterize visionary architecture and urban projects, often erroneously ascribed to Utopia, make it difficult to understand how most proposed new conditions can be said to be realizable or even to suggest a Utopia.<br>

Article Title: “Terminus.”<br>
Publisher: Johns Hopkins UP<br>
Issue: sciefictstud.41.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 1973<br>
Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>

Abstract: This essay places before the reader four historic texts that raise significant questions for Jews and Christians who choose to enter into post-Holocaust examination of their respective identities and their relationships to their grounding traditions. The Kristallnacht exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum introduces museum visitors to the defaced Talmudic instruction of R. Eliezer—
         Know before whom you stand-which frames this essay. As with the story the museum recounts, more than texts are at stake in this essay, but the way forward is distinctly framed by their critical presence. In this case, the distinctive texts are faced in reconfiguring ways, asking those who face them to rethink the place of the other in their identities and life-orienting commitments. Early on, Samuel Bak's surrealistic rendering of a crucified, Jewish child provides a refracting image for exploring the questions these texts pose for post-Shoah people of faith who take their place before them, asking in recursive fashion: before whom do you stand?<br>
