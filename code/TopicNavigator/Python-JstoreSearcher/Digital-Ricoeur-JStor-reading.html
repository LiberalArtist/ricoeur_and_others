  Abstract: On June 23, 1584, Fray Luis de Granada (1504–88) wrote a letter to his friend, Pedro de Ribadeneyra (1526–1611), exalting the latter’s literary qualities, including the candor of his prose.¹ Writing from Lisbon, the prolific Dominican was moved to write in a spirit of gratitude and admiration after reading Ribadeneyra’s
                  Vida del P. Ignacio de Loyola, fundador de la Compañía de Jesus(1583).² In the letter, he expressed the deepest admiration for Ribadeneyra’s style and clarity. He also commended his Jesuit counterpart for his balanced account of the origins of the Society of Jesus as well as for<br>

  Abstract: The purposes of this essay are both diagnostic and prescriptive. The diagnosis involves an attempt to locate a few common themes that recur throughout this issue. In some measure, this task is no more than a summary of ideas developed in the preceding pages, but as these ideas are isolated and connected with one another, an argumentative configuration begins to emerge. The authors represented here find evidence of health and vigor in the field, but a comparative reading of their essays indicates that the art suffers from a set of related problems. These problems are expressed in terms of confusion<br>

  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Abstract: Let me begin with a warning. It might also be read as a plea for excuse: I am neither a true believer in mimetic theory/theology nor a connoisseur of Girardian methodology and its recent developments (if there are any).¹ My reading of René Girard’s oeuvre has been rather sporadic and even somewhat naive. I always took (and after consideration, I still take) the Girardian approach for a general (but also generic) suspicion; I don’t read his theory as a specific (scientific) hypothesis.

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In the last fifteen years, Girard has engaged in a dialogue with the Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo. Vattimo is famous for a philosophical approach named
                  pensiero debole(weak thought). “Weak thought” is basically concerned with arguing for philosophical antifoundationalism: drawing on the philosophy of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Gadamer, Vattimo advocates the rejection of metaphysics and a reinterpretation of truth as the opening of horizons. Vattimo has explained that he came to recognize a “completion” of Heidegger in Girard by reading “the weakening of Being as its sole form of manifesting itself beyond metaphysical oblivion” as “an analogon of the dissolution<br>

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what~<br>

  Abstract: Of the various text divisions that have been suggested for Canto XIII, the best is perhaps Benvenuto’s three-part reading: the description of the place with its voices (1–42), the description of penance and purgation (43–72), and the conversation with “a modern spirit” (73–154). Like all the others, however, this division submerges the brief but eerie episode of Virgil’s prayer to the sun (10–23), which demands and will receive special treatment here.<br>

  Abstract: In “The Art of Allusion: Hans-Georg Gadamer’s Philosophical Interventions under National Socialism,” Teresa Orozco accuses Gadamer of having written “Plato and the Poets” to justify Nazi suppression of liberal humanist education and “Plato’s Educational State” to support national conservative efforts to reform the regime. Geoffrey Waite repeats her accusation in “Radio Nietzsche.” Whereas most twentieth-century readers of Nietzsche have unintentionally fostered his elitist politics by adopting a perspectivist reading, Waite charges, Orozco shows that Gadamer did so intentionally. In my view, there is little evidence to support either charge.<br>

  Abstract: One of the most significant lessons of the literary criticism of the last few decades has been that the currently accepted meaning of any text is a product of the interpretive institutions and communities acting upon it. Fredric Jameson suggests that we never really encounter textual meaning “as a thing-in-itself. Rather, texts come before us as the alwaysalready-read; we apprehend them through sedimented layers of previous interpretations, or—if the text is brand-new—through the sedimented reading habits and categories developed by those inherited interpretive traditions.”¹ Stanley Fish further observes that some interpretations, for a variety of reasons, succeed so<br>

  Author(s) Borneman John<br>
  Abstract: This essay examines the relation of presence in fieldwork to interlocution. Within anthropology in the past several decades, two kinds of criticisms of the fieldwork encounter have had particular resonance: that fieldwork experience and presence do not generate any unique knowledge and that the power/dominance of the (Western) ethnographer ethically taints the knowledge derived from encounters. The questioning of the ethnographer’s presence has frequently led to text-based reading being substituted for fieldwork experience, with a corresponding focus on textual representation; the questioning of the ethnographer’s power has led to demands for collaboration and dialogue, which in turn often emphasize righteous<br>

  Abstract: Here is the first survey of the surviving evidence for the growth, development, and influence of the Neoplatonist allegorical reading of the

The Neoplatonist reading was to be decisive in the birth of allegorical epic in late antiquity and forms the background for the next major extension of the epic tradition found in Dante.<br>

I have avoided any attempt to hold that reading of Homer up against others, to affirm or to deny it, beyond occasional observations on analogies between these ancient interpretive critics and those of our own time. My reticence on this score reveals an implicit model of reading with similarities to Bloom’s, and no doubt in part derivative from it.

  Book Title: Transpacific Displacement-Ethnography, Translation, and Intertextual Travel in Twentieth-Century American Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Huang Yunte<br>
  Abstract: Yunte Huang takes a most original "ethnographic" approach to more and less well-known American texts as he traces what he calls the transpacific displacement of cultural meanings through twentieth-century America's imaging of Asia. Informed by the politics of linguistic appropriation and disappropriation,
      Transpacific Displacementopens with a radically new reading of Imagism through the work of Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. Huang relates Imagism to earlier linguistic ethnographies of Asia and to racist representations of Asians in American pop culture, such as the book and movie character Charlie Chan, then shows that Asian American writers subject both literary Orientalism and racial stereotyping to double ventriloquism and countermockery. Going on to offer a provocative critique of some textually and culturally homogenizing tendencies exemplified in Maxine Hong Kingston's work and its reception, Huang ends with a study of American translations of contemporary Chinese poetry, which he views as new ethnographies that maintain linguistic and cultural boundaries.<br>

  Book Title: Fighting Words-Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Renard John<br>
  Abstract: One of the critical issues in interreligious relations today is the connection, both actual and perceived, between sacred sources and the justification of violent acts as divinely mandated.
      Fighting Wordsmakes solid text-based scholarship accessible to the general public, beginning with the premise that a balanced approach to religious pluralism in our world must build on a measured, well-informed response to the increasingly publicized and sensationalized association of terrorism and large-scale violence with religion. In his introduction, Renard provides background on the major scriptures of seven religious traditions-Jewish, Christian (including both the Old and New Testaments), Islamic, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Sikh. Eight chapters then explore the interpretation of select facets of these scriptures, focusing on those texts so often claimed, both historically and more recently, as inspiration and justification for every kind of violence, from individual assassination to mass murder. With its nuanced consideration of a complex topic, this book is not merely about the religious sanctioning of violence but also about diverse ways of reading sacred textual sources.<br>

                  Physicsreanimates an ancient (and very recent) question: How are body and place related? A first answer, given by Aristotle himself, posits a rigid material body in place by virtue of its sheer contiguity with the inner surface of what immediately surrounds it—a strictly physical intimacy that works by close containment. This containment acts in effect to cap and control the vagrant and violent movements of elemental qualities and powers as depicted in Plato’sTimaeus,a cosmogonic tale in which the tumult ofchōragives way to the order of determinatetopoi.Whether this<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

Granted, it is probably more customary to think of what we do when standing before a headstone as something other than “reading.” It is not quite scanning, which we routinely perform when we see a billboard or sign.

  Book Title: Myth and Scripture-Contemporary Perspectives on Religion, Language, and Imagination<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Callender Dexter E.<br>
  Abstract: In this collection scholars suggest that using "myth" creates a framework within which to set biblical writings in both cultural and literary comparative contexts. Reading biblical accounts alongside the religious narratives of other ancient civilizations reveals what is commonplace and shared among them. The fruit of such work widens and enriches our understanding of the nature and character of biblical texts, and the results provide fresh evidence for how biblical writings became "scripture."<br>

  Abstract: Professor Segal’s paper, “The Life of King Saul as Myth,” was originally embedded in a longer presentation entitled “The Indispensability of Theories of Myth for Biblical Studies.” It was given to a joint session of the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature at their annual meetings in 2009. Professor Segal had attempted to demonstrate his thesis about the indispensability of theories of myth for biblical studies by giving a reading of the Saul narratives in the Hebrew Bible, which was informed by the hero theories of myth in the work of Otto Rank, Lord Raglan, Joseph<br>

  Abstract: Jaime Gil de Biedma’s poems come across on first reading as clear and “realistic.” Many of them comprise detailed evocations of specific episodes, narrated by a first-person speaker who gives commentaries and conclusions. Quite often these commentaries offer philosophic insights; at times, especially in the later books, they contain social or political ideas. All of this has led some critics to characterize Gil de Biedma as a realistic poet proccupied with ethical and social issues.¹ The very clarity of his work has caused readers to miss its depth and originality.<br>

  Book Title: God--The World's Future-Systematic Theology for a New Era<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: God—The World’s Future has been a proven and comprehensive textbook in systematic theology for over twenty years. Explicitly crafted to address our postmodern context, Peters explains the whole body of Christian historical doctrine from within a “proleptic” framework, “whereby the gospel is understood as announcing the pre-actualization of the future consummation of all things in Jesus Christ.” Peters skillfully deploys this concept not only to organize the various theological areas or loci but also to rethink doctrines in light of key postmodern challenges from ecumenism, critical historical thinking, contemporary science, and gender and sexuality issues. The Third Edition is thoroughly revised with updated chapters, additional chapters, updated annotations and bibliographies, and further elaborations in light of recent developments in method and theological reflection. This classic text opens up systematic theology in new dimensions, retrieving traditional categories and topics for a new generation of students and learners to give a fresh reading of Christian theology and articulation of the liberating message of the gospel of God’s grace for the future of the world.<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Book Title: For Derrida-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller J. Hillis<br>
  Abstract: This book-the culmination of forty years of friendship between J. Hillis Miller and Jacques Derrida, during which Miller also closely followed all Derrida's writings and seminars-is for Derridain two senses. It is for him,dedicated to his memory. The chapters also speak, in acts of reading, as advocates for Derrida's work. They focus especially on Derrida's late work, including passages from the last, as yet unpublished, seminars. The chapters are partial to Derrida,on his side, taking his part, gratefully submitting themselves to the demand made by Derrida's writings to be read-slowly, carefully, faithfully, with close attention to semantic detail.The chapters do not progress forward to tell a sequential story. They are, rather, a series of perspectives on the heterogeneity of Derrida's work, or forays into that heterogeneity.The chief goal has been, to borrow a phrase from Wallace Stevens, plainly to propoundwhat Derrida says. The book aims, above all, to render Derrida's writings justice. It should be remembered, however, that, according to Derrida himself, every rendering of justice is also a transformative interpretation. A book like this one is not a substitute for reading Derrida for oneself. It is to be hoped that it will encourage readers to do just that.<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Horner Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking God as Gift is situated at the intersection of philosophy, critical theory and theology. The first sustained study of the work of Jean-Luc Marion in English, it offers a unique perspective on contemporary questions and their theological relevance. Taking its point of departure from the problem of the gift as articulated by Jacques Derrida, who argues that the conditions of possibility of the gift are also its conditions of impossibility, Horner pursues a series of questions concerning the nature of thought, the viability of phenomenology, and, most urgently, the possibility of grace. For Marion, phenomenology, as the thought of the given, offers a path for philosophy to proceed without being implicated in metaphysics. His retrieval of several important insights of Edmund Husserl, along with his reading of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Lvinas, enables him to work out a phenomenology where even impossiblephenomena such as revelation and the gift might be examined. In this important confrontation between Marion and Derrida issues vital to the negotiation of postmodern concerns in philosophy and theology emerge with vigour. The careful elucidation of those issues in an interdisciplinary context, and the snapshot it provides of the state of contemporary debate, make Rethinking God as Gift an important contribution to theological and philosophical discussion.<br>

  Abstract: A concise way of defining phenomenology is to say that it is characterized by two questions: What is given (to consciousness)? and How (or according to what horizon) is it given? While what is given may not necessarily be a gift, it is already evident from the framing of this definition that the question of the gift will not be irrelevant in this context. Just how that is so will become clearer in later chapters. For the moment, however, it is sufficient to note that the reading of the gift that Marion propounds aims to be a strictly phenomenological one,<br>

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

  Book Title: A Scholar's Tale: Intellectual Journey of a Displaced Child of Europe-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HARTMAN GEOFFREY<br>
  Abstract: For more than fifty years, Geoffrey Hartman has been a pivotal figure in the humanities. In his first book, in 1954, he helped establish the study of Romanticism as key to the problems of modernity. Later, his writings were crucial to the explosive developments in literary theory in the late seventies, and he was a pioneer in Jewish studies, trauma studies, and studies of the Holocaust. At Yale, he was a founder of its Judaic Studies program, as well as of the first major video archive for Holocaust testimonies.Generations of students have benefited from Hartman's generosity, his penetrating and incisive questioning, the wizardry of his close reading, and his sense that the work of a literary scholar, no less than that of an artist, is a creative act. All these qualities shine forth in this intellectual memoir, which will stand as his autobiography. Hartman describes his early education, uncanny sense of vocation, and development as a literary scholar and cultural critic. He looks back at how his career was influenced by his experience, at the age of nine, of being a refugee from Nazi Germany in the Kindertransport. He spent the next six years at school in England, where he developed his love of English literature and the English countryside, before leaving to join his mother in America.Hartman treats us to a biobibliographyof his engagements with the major trends in literary criticism. He covers the exciting period at Yale handled so controversially by the media and gives us vivid portraits, in particular, of Harold Bloom, Paul de Man, and Jacques Derrida.SEND GEOFFREY COVER COPY All this is set in the context of his gradual self-awareness of what scholarship implies and how his personal displacements strengthened his calling to mediate between European and American literary cultures. Anyone looking for a rich, intelligible account of the last half-century of combative literary studies will want to read Geoffrey Hartman's unapologetic scholar's tale.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Book Title: God's Mirror: Renewal and Engagement in French Catholic Intellectual Culture in the Mid-Twentieth Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garfitt Toby<br>
  Abstract: Gathering in one place a cohesive selection of articles that deepen our sense of the vitality and controversy within the Catholic renewal of the mid-twentieth century, God's Mirror offers historical analysis of French Catholic intellectuals. This volume highlights the work of writers, thinkers and creative artists who have not always drawn the attention given to such luminaries as Maritain, Mounier, and Marcel. Organized around the typologies of renewal and engagement, editors Katherine Davies and Toby Garfitt provide a revisionist and interdisciplinary reading of the narrative of twentieth-century French Catholicism. Renewal and engagement are both manifestations of how the Catholic intellectual reflects and takes position on the relationship between the Church, personal faith and the world, and on the increasingly problematic relationship between intellectuals and the Magisterium. A majority of the writings are based on extensive research into published texts, with some occasional archival references, and they give critical insights into the tensions that characterized the theological and political concerns of their subjects.<br>

  Book Title: Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stahlberg Lesleigh Cushing<br>
  Abstract: Scrolls of Love is a book of unions. Edited by a Jew and a Christian who are united by a shared passion for the Bible and a common literary hermeneutic, it joins two biblical scrolls and gathers around them a diverse community of interpreters. It brings together Ruth and the Song of Songs, two seemingly disparate texts of the Hebrew Bible, and reads them through a number of the methodological and theological perspectives. Respectful of traditional biblical scholarship, the collection of essays moves beyond it; alert to contemporary trends, the volume returns venerable interpretive tradition to center stage. Most significantly, it is interfaith. Despite the fact that Jews and Christians share a common text in the Hebrew Scripture, the two communities have read their Bibles in isolation from one another, in ignorance of the richness of the other's traditions of reading. Scrolls of Love brings the two traditions into dialogue, enriching established modes of interpretation with unconventional ones. The result is a volume that sets rabbinic, patristic, and medieval readings alongside feminist, psychoanalytic, and autobiographical ones, combining historical, literary, and textual criticism with a variety of artistic reinterpretations-wood cuts and paper cuts, poetry and fiction. Some of the works are scholarly, with the requisite footnotes to draw readers to further inquiry: others are more reflective than analytic, allowing readers to see what it means to live intimately with Scripture. As a unity, the collection presents Ruth and Song of Songs not only as ancient texts that deserve to be treasured but as old worlds capable of begetting the new.<br>

  Maurice Blanchot and the Future of Memory (Today) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x07vw">Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma</a><br>
  Abstract: To end with a discussion of the work of Maurice Blanchot is rife with difficulties, two of which I will mention by way of beginning. The first involves the sheer difficulty of reading his work. While to be sure, this seems to be something of a “side issue,” it is one with important consequences: An encounter with Blanchot’s texts—whether those of his fiction, his criticism or the aphoristic, fragmentary texts of the later years—induces a deep feeling of exposure and vertigo, the negativity or indeterminacy of which is hardly conceivable as a mediating moment toward a higher reconciliation,<br>

  Book Title: Reading Descartes Otherwise: Blind, Mad, Dreamy, and Bad-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Kyoo<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the first four images of the Other mobilized in Descartes' Meditations--namely, the blind, the mad, the dreamy, and the bad--Reading Descartes Otherwise casts light on what have heretofore been the phenomenological shadows of "Cartesian rationality." In doing so, it discovers dynamic signs of spectral alterity lodged both at the core and on the edges of modern Cartesian subjectivity. Calling for a Copernican reorientation of the very notion "Cartesianism," the book's series of close, creatively critical readings of Descartes' signature images brings the dramatic forces, moments, and scenes of the cogito into our own contemporary moment. The author patiently unravels the knotted skeins of ambiguity that have been spun within philosophical modernity out of such cliches as "Descartes, the abstract modern subject" and "Descartes, the father of modern philosophy"--a figure who is at once everywhere and nowhere. In the process, she revitalizes and reframes the legacy of Cartesian modernity, in a way more mindful of its proto-phenomenological traces.<br>

  Abstract: Toward a philosophical interpretation of the twentieth century. How should we understand this expression? What meaning should we assign it? We might suggest two different answers to these questions, which are in some ways even contradictory. The first is the classic answer, associated with the great twentieth-century philosophical tradition of Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre, to mention a few of the most well-known names. This answer calls for a reading of contemporary historical events through an interpretative lens that philosophy itself provides and singles out as the only one capable of grasping its essence. Whether such an interpretive lens is identified<br>

  Abstract: Philosophy today stands in a problematic relationship to wisdom. Introductory texts still relish defining
                  philosophiaas “the love of wisdom.”¹ But, as anyone reading on discovers, the ideal of wisdom itself is long gone. In its place is the view that philosophy provides exceedingly clever and conflicting answers to puzzles that do not particularly relate to the conduct of life or the discovery of its profoundest meanings. Most of those puzzles have to do with the problems of the justification of beliefs, putting philosophy in an auxiliary relationship to the project of knowledge.

  Abstract: In this book, I have argued that reading the texts of classical political economy together with post-Kantian literature offers us important insights into some of the central controversies of contemporary cultural theory. Ideological debates in the humanities will benefit immeasurably once we recognize that philosophical inquiry is not a hindrance to but an essential ally of empirical history. As Adorno frequently reminded us, the attempt to renounce all pretensions to subjective expression and surrender oneself to the objective authority of what exists (or has existed) is no less likely to lapse into idealism than the most detailed elaboration of self-reflexive<br>

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

Any exegete must acknowledge Paul’s playful polarities of wisdom and folly, power and weakness, and so on.

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kempshall Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an analytical overview of the vast range of historiography which was produced in western Europe over a thousand-year period between c.400 and c.1500. Concentrating on the general principles of classical rhetoric central to the language of this writing, alongside the more familiar traditions of ancient history, biblical exegesis and patristic theology, this survey introduces the conceptual sophistication and semantic rigour with which medieval authors could approach their narratives of past and present events, and the diversity of ends to which this history could then be put. By providing a close reading of some of the historians who put these linguistic principles and strategies into practice (from Augustine and Orosius through Otto of Freising and William of Malmesbury to Machiavelli and Guicciardini), it traces and questions some of the key methodological changes that characterise the function and purpose of the western historiographical tradition in this formative period of its development.<br>

      The Secret Life of Stories, Michael Bérubé tells a dramatically different tale, in a compelling account of how an understanding of intellectual disability can transform our understanding of narrative. Instead of focusing on characters with disabilities, he shows how ideas about intellectual disability inform an astonishingly wide array of narrative strategies, providing a new and startling way of thinking through questions of time, self-reflexivity, and motive in the experience of reading. Interweaving his own stories with readings of such texts as Faulkner'sThe Sound and the Fury, Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Kingston'sThe Woman Warrior, and Philip K. Dick'sMartian Time-Slip, Bérubé puts his theory into practice, stretching the purview of the study of literature and the role of disability studies within it. Armed only with the tools of close reading, Bérubé demonstrates the immensely generative possibilities in the ways disability is deployed within fiction, finding in them powerful meditations on what it means to be a social being, a sentient creature with an awareness of mortality and causality-and sentience itself. Persuasive and witty, Michael Bérubé engages Harry Potter fans and scholars of literature alike. For all readers,The Secret Life of Storieswill fundamentally change the way we think about the way we read.<br>

  Abstract: Literary texts have any number of ways of marking their awareness of themselves as literary texts. Some are cloying; some are trivial; some are merely cute. Some involve explicitly metafictional engagements with the fictionality of fiction, as in the closing passage of Beckett’s
                  Molloy, echoing and complicating the opening passage of the novella’s second section: “Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining” (176). Some involve more subtle, implicit meditations on the degree of readerly self-consciousness necessary for reading, as in<br>

  Abstract: The terms ‘righteous’ and ‘righteousness’ do not occur in the book of Joshua and, after reading its stories of the conquest, one could be forgiven for concluding ‘with good reason’. To a modern reader the divine command to utterly destroy another nation smacks of ‘ ethnic cleansing’ or genocide. Nevertheless, if one takes the literary and theological context of the larger Hebrew Bible/Old Testament into account, as well as its ANE context, some appreciation can be gained of the presence of such stories and their contribution to the theology of divine righteousness.<br>

  Abstract: Dei Verbum (DV), with its focus on the word, is a document about communication. While the title speaks of God’s communication and implies our listening, it leads to understanding the human response to God’s word as well as the realisation that it is a human mission to communicate that word. The first communication is speaking the word, speaking it out. Then comes the writing down of the word for people to ‘hear’ it by reading. But, we are in a different era in the twenty-first century with so many ways of communicating God’s word, so many ways of ‘hearing’ it.<br>

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

The old historicalcritical analysis has not been generating new life for a long time.¹ Other approaches have not so far struck lasting root. The interaction of developmental (cf diachronic) reading and interpretational (cf synchronic) reading is under way, but far from any agreed integration.

Intuiting that the two masks demonstrate a substantial complicity and distrusting an idea of peace that continues to be based on war, Lévinas elaborates a radical critique of violence that is based on an atypical reading of the sixth commandment—or,<br>

  Abstract: Part 1 proposed a new theoretical basis for the ancient idea that in major creative literature the manipulation of language in the context of a poem or fictional narrative can suffice to throw light on something worth calling real. Its central pillar is an account of meaning derived from a new reading of Wittgenstein that departs radically from the traditional account, entrenched for many centuries in Western philosophy, of how language connects with reality.

  Book Title: Luther and Liberation-A Latin American Perspective<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Altmann Walter<br>
  Abstract: With the approach of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s inauguration of the Protestant Reformation and the burgeoning dialogue between Catholics and Lutherans opened under Pope Francis, this new edition of Walter Altmann’s Luther and Liberation is timely and relevant. Luther and Liberation recovers the liberating and revolutionary impact of Luther’s theology, read afresh from the perspective of the Latin American context. Altmann provides a much-needed reassessment of Luther’s significance today through a direct engagement of Luther’s historical situation with an eye keenly situated on the deeply contextual situation of the contemporary reader, giving a localized reading from the author’s own experience in Latin America. The work examines with fresh vigor Luther’s central theological commitments, such as his doctrine of God, Christology, justification, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology, and his forays into economics, politics, education, violence, and war. This new edition greatly expands the original text with fresh scholarship and updated sources, footnotes, and bibliography, and contains several additional new chapters on Luther’s doctrine of God, theology of the sacraments, his controversial perspective on the Jews, and a new comparative account with the Latin American liberation theology tradition.<br>

  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Phillips John<br>
  Abstract: ‘Phillips discusses texts by Apollinaire, Pierre Loüys, Georges Bataille, Pauline Réage, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Tony Duvert, Elizabeth Barillé and Marie Darrieussecq, engaging in different levels of critical analysis so as to emphasize intertextual and parodic elements in one case, or points of possible identification in another.’ TLS French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than its Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Forbidden Fictions is the first English-language study devoted exclusively to the wide spectrum of French literary pornography in the twentieth century. John Phillips provides a broad history of the genre and the associated moral and political issues. Among the texts examined in detail – all selected for their literary or sociopolitical importance – are landmark works by Apollinaire, Louÿs, Bataille, Réage, Robbe-Grillet, Arsan, and Duvert. Phillips challenges current politically correct trends in literary criticism and stereotyped censoring discourses about pornography to provide a new reading of each text and to illustrate the genre’s potential for social subversion. Forbidden Fictions addresses the most controversial issues of contemporary sexual politics, such as objectification, sadomasochism, homoeroticism and paedophilia, with particular emphasis on the feminist debate on pornography. In the light of current controversy over the control of pornography, this is a timely and scholarly review of the ethical, moral and social arguments surrounding the censorship of sexually explicit material.<br>

  Book Title: Persistent Forms: Explorations in Historical Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Maslov Boris<br>
  Abstract: Since the mid-1980s, attempts to think history and literature together have produced much exciting work in the humanities. Indeed, some form of historicism can be said to inform most of the current scholarship in literary studies, including work in poetics, yet much of this scholarship remains undertheorized. Envisioning a revitalized and more expansive historicism, this volume builds on the tradition of Historical Poetics, pioneered by Alexander Veselovsky (1838-1906) and developed in various fruitful directions by the Russian Formalists, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Olga Freidenberg. The volume includes previously untranslated texts of some of the major scholars in this critical tradition, as well as original contributions which place that tradition in dialogue with other thinkers who have approached literature in a globally comparatist and evolutionary-historical spirit. The contributors seek to challenge and complement a historicism that stresses proximate sociopolitical contexts through an engagement with the longue duree of literary forms and institutions. In particular, Historical Poetics aims to uncover deep-historical stratifications and asynchronicities, in which formal solutions may display elective affinities with other, chronologically distant solutions to analogous social and political problems. By recovering the traditional nexus of philology and history, Persistent Forms seeks to reinvigorate poetics as a theoretical discipline that would respond to such critical and intellectual developments as Marxism, New Historicism, the study of world literature, practices of distant reading, and a renewed attention to ritual, oral poetics, and genre.<br>

  Abstract: From the first third of the eighteenth century, a new style begins to install itself in European literatures. Wherever it was engendered, it was preceded by a corresponding mood
                  [nastroenie]of the social psyche, a reflection of the recently accomplished social revolution. This is what happened in England, which explains England’s leading role in the ensuing currents of European thought, the influence of its didactic comedy and itscomédie larmoyante,its novelists, whom Diderot and Rousseau indulged in reading. This influence had an uneven impact, depending on how well prepared, in a given society, the soil was to receive the<br>

  Book Title: Practicing the City: Early Modern London on Stage-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Levine Nina<br>
  Abstract: In late-sixteenth-century London, the commercial theaters undertook a novel experiment, fueling a fashion for plays that trafficked in the contemporary urban scene. But beyond the stage's representing the everyday activities of the expanding metropolis, its unprecedented urban turn introduced a new dimension into theatrical experience, opening up a reflexive space within which an increasingly diverse population might begin to "practice" the city. In this, the London stage began to operate as a medium as well as a model for urban understanding. Practicing the City traces a range of local engagements, onstage and off, in which the city's population came to practice new forms of urban sociability and belonging. With this practice, Levine suggests, city residents became more self-conscious about their place within the expanding metropolis and, in the process, began to experiment in new forms of collective association. Reading an array of materials, from Shakespeare and Middleton to plague bills and French-language manuals, Levine explores urban practices that push against the exclusions of civic tradition and look instead to the more fluid relations playing out in the disruptive encounters of urban plurality.<br>

Modernist writers converge in St. Petersburg and Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and São Paulo, as in Paris, London, Lisbon, Prague, New York and other cities whose contours filter into their fictions.

  Abstract: On first reading these lines do not appear to impress the reader as seriously problematic. They merely recount how the Lover, having gazed into Narcissus’s “perilous fountain” in the Jardin de Déduit and been wounded by Cupid’s arrow, first sees and fixes upon what would be the object of his amorous passion, the rosebud. Yet, the undeniable indeterminacy with respect to the object of our lover-protagonist’s passion underscores a certain emptiness that appears to characterize this object, at least at this juncture in Guillaume’s poem. This is quite jarring; readers conventionally speak of the Lover’s obsession with

  Abstract: Scripture has been the indispensable, authorizing source of Christian sermons since Christianity’s beginnings. The sermons of Peter, Stephen, and Paul in Acts all draw on Old Testament texts. The book of Hebrews, thought by some to be a collection of early Christian sermons, draws on material across the Old Testament, especially the Psalms. This chapter provides you with a disciplined, prayerful, and scholarly process for engaging Scripture. Exegetical work (close grammatical, historical, and theological study of a text) is supported in this method by meditative Scripture reading using the centuriesold process called

But, although one of Williams’ early engagements with Wittgenstein pairs him with Bonhoeffer, Myers does not comment on the latter. Even after Williams’ prominence at Bonhoeffer’s centenary in 2006, the influence of Bonhoeffer on Williams remains largely unexplored by commentators of either writer.

  Book Title: Husserl's Missing Technologies-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): IHDE DON<br>
  Abstract: Husserl's Missing Technologies looks at the early-twentieth-century "classical" phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, both in the light of the philosophy of science of his time, and retrospectively at his philosophy from a contemporary "postphenomenology." Of central interest are his infrequent comments upon technologies and especially scientific instruments such as the telescope and microscope. Together with his analysis of Husserl, Don Ihde ventures through the recent history of technologies of science, reading and writing, and science praxis, calling for modifications to phenomenology by converging it with pragmatism. This fruitful hybridization emphasizes human-technology interrelationships, the role of embodiment and bodily skills, and the inherent multistability of technologies. In a radical argument, Ihde contends that philosophies, in the same way that various technologies contain an ever-shortening obsolescence, ought to have contingent use-lives.<br>

Here I examine, primarily, Husserl’s own technologies—reading and writing technologies, including his eyeglasses for his aging sight problems, his own writing style, which uses pens and standup and then sit-down desks, the role of the typewriter and its associated copy processes with references to early twentieth-century scholarly distribution—and then I contrast these with his informal comments concerning scientific technologies, those of optics, and other tools.<br>

  Author(s) WIRZBA NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology, as properly practiced, is a response to what is given rather than a single procedure that can be perfected. Responses can take various forms—essays, treatises, paintings, conversations, narratives, plays, and poems—each of which has constraints that, whether respected or transgressed, inflect phenomenological observation in different ways. Literature certainly gives us a range of examples for understanding phenomenology. When reading Italo Calvino’s

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

  Author(s): Kujundžić Dragan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J. Hillis Miller, one of the most eminent literary scholars in America. For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future. Barbara Cohen is Director of HumaniTech at the University of California, Irvine. She is co-editor of Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory. Dragan Kujunzic is Professor of Russian and Comparative Literature and Director of Russian Studies at the University of California, Irvine.

Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

What might their diverse approaches teach today’s readers of the Old and New Testaments? What is missing in contemporary biblical interpretation that an awareness of the history of exegesis might complete? Join C.

  Book Title: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hebbard Aaron B.<br>
  Abstract: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics sets out to read the book of Daniel as a narrative textbook in the field of theological hermeneutics. Employing such disciplines as historical criticism, literary criticism, narrative theology, and hermeneutics, this work seeks to maintain an interdisciplinary outlook on the book of Daniel. Two inherently linked perspectives are utilized in this reading of Daniel. First is the perception that the character of Daniel is the paradigm of the good theological hermeneut; theology and hermeneutics are inseparable and converge in the character of Daniel. Readers must recognize in Daniel certain qualities, attitudes, abilities, and convictions well worth emulating. Essentially, readers must aspire to become a Daniel. Second is the standpoint that the book of Daniel on the whole should be read as a hermeneutics textbook. Readers are led through a series of theories and exercises meant to be instilled into their theological, intellectual, and practical lives. Attention to readers is a constant endeavor throughout this thesis. The concern is fundamentally upon contemporary readers and their communities, yet with sensible consideration given to the historical readerly community with which contemporary readers find continuity. Greater concentration is placed on what the book of Daniel means for contemporary readers than on what the book of Daniel meant in its historical setting. In the end, readers are left with difficult challenges, a sobering awareness of the volatility of the business of hermeneutics, and serious implications for readers to implement both theologically and hermeneutically.<br>

  Book Title: Onslaught against Innocence-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
  Abstract: While in Genesis 2-11 the Yahwist confronts the issue of evil through a sequence of stories on the progressive deterioration of the divine-human relationship, in Genesis 4 he describes the initial slaughter of one human being by another as fratricidal. This book provides a close reading of J's story by using literary criticism and psychological criticism, and shows that the biblical author has more than an "archaeological" design. His characters - including God, Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel, plus minor character - are paradigmatic, as they allow J to proceed with a fine analytical feel for the nature of evil as performed by "homo" as "homini lupus." No imaginative "mimesis" of evil has ever been recounted with such an economy of means and such depth of psychological insight.<br>

  Book Title: Beyond Old and New Perspectives on Paul-Reflections on the Work of Douglas Campbell<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Adams Edward<br>
  Abstract: In his work 'Deliverance of God' Douglas Campbell presents what Chris Tilling considers a "complete rereading of Paul’s letters that genuinely offers a way beyond problems associated with old and new perspectives. And his resultant picture of Paul’s theology generally, and the Apostle’s soteriology particularly, is beautiful, liberating, consistent, exegetically rigorous, theologically aware and pastorally compelling. It captures, I think, the best of the old perspective, with its concern to speak energetically about the God who saves, and it takes seriously the concerns of the new perspective on Second Temple Judaism. But in remarkable and jarringly elegant ways, it moves beyond them both." This collection of essays is divided into two sections. Part One analyses key aspects of Campbell’s account of the problem confronting readers of Paul. Part Two analyses key aspects of Campbell’s proposed solution to to the current confused state of Pauline interpretation. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in the study of Paul.<br>

Such readings lead, inter alia, to an individualistic view of salvation in which the gospel is not freely given, but necessitated because of human sinfulness. I applaud<br>

Implicit in this reading of Findley’s work is a tripartite model of reader response theory that includes a self-consciously constructing writer, a self-referentially deconstructing reader, and the enigmatic text of their mutual exchange.

What might the consequences be of framing a work as fiction, or rather as (to some extent) factual, and of experiencing our reading of such a novel as a communication with a fictional character, or rather with a narrator, or even an author? In what respect would our ethos attribution change? What made readers expect Frey to be authentic and truthful in his narration of his character’s tribulations? Can and<br>

  Abstract: Novels written today spill over with references to other media—television, film, music, the Internet. The presence of such alternate media in the novel can be seen as simply a natural reflection of contemporary life. During an average day, most of us spend some time watching television, sending e-mail, reading the newspaper, and listening to the radio.

  Book Title: Contemporary Comics Storytelling-  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): KUKKONEN KARIN<br>
  Abstract: Applying a cognitive approach to reading comics in all their narrative richness and intricacy,
      Contemporary Comics Storytellingopens an intriguing perspective on how these works engage the legacy of postmodernism-its subversion, self-reflexivity, and moral contingency. Its three case studies trace how contemporary comics tie into deep traditions of visual and verbal storytelling, how they reevaluate their own status as fiction, and how the fictional minds of their characters generate complex ethical thought experiments. At a time when the medium is taken more and more seriously as intricate and compelling literary art, this book lays the groundwork for an analysis of the ways in which comics challenge and engage readers' minds. It brings together comics studies with narratology and literary criticism and, in so doing, provides a new set of tools for evaluating the graphic novel as an emergent literary form.<br>

  Book Title: The Postmodern Bible-The Bible and Culture Collective<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wuellner Wilhelm<br>
  Abstract: The burgeoning use of modern literary theory and cultural criticism in recent biblical studies has led to stimulating-but often bewildering-new readings of the Bible. This book, argued from a perspective shaped by postmodernism, is at once an accessible guide to and an engagement with various methods, theories, and critical practices transforming biblical scholarship today.Written by a collective of cutting-edge scholars-with each page the work of multiple hands-
      The Postmodern Bibledeliberately breaks with the individualist model of authorship that has traditionally dominated scholarship in the humanities and is itself an illustration of the postmodern transformation of biblical studies for which it argues.The book introduces, illustrates, and critiques seven prominent strategies of reading. Several of these interpretive strategies-rhetorical criticism, structuralism and narratology, reader-response criticism, and feminist criticism-have been instrumental in the transformation of biblical studies up to now. Many-feminist and womanist criticism, ideological criticism, poststructuralism, and psychoanalytic criticism-hold promise for the continued transformation of these studies in the future. Focusing on readings from both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, this volume illuminates the current multidisciplinary debates emerging from postmodernism by exposing the still highly contested epistemological, political, and ethical positions in the field of biblical studies.<br>

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.<br>

  Abstract: Clifford Geertz (1926–2006) was one of the main figures to build a new kind of anthropology, beginning in the 1960s. In doing so, he borrowed many ideas from philosophy. Although some of his works have been read by philosophers too, the influence of his anthropology on philosophy is negligible. The reception of his thoughts does not conform to the generally accepted significance of his writings, appropriate to their philosophical content. Most often, Geertz is read only superficially and the reading is confined to his two most famous texts – ‘Thick Description’ (1973) and ‘Deep Play: Notes on Balinese Cockfight’ (1972).<br>

This contribution is marked by a clear ambivalence. On the one hand, it is obvious that it was in no way gratuitous.

Doing so can help people to know that they are not alone in their suffering, thus fulfilling Donne’s axiom that “no man is an island, entire of itself.”¹ The other direction points toward texts and rituals in one’s religious faith and spiritual practices, seeking a linkage between one’s own story and a larger, transcendent story: one that recounts what is sacred or ultimate.<br>

As will also be shown, of these means, art and the aesthetical are crucial for Stiegler, as is his “atheological” reading of Aristotle’s three levels of the soul.<br>

  Book Title: I Am Because We Are-Readings in Africana Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: University of Massachusetts Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Jonathan Scott<br>
  Abstract: Over the past twenty years, however, new scholarly research has uncovered other contributions to the discipline now generally known as "Africana philosophy" that were not included in the original volume. In this revised and expanded edition, Hord and Lee build on the strengths of the earlier anthology while enriching the selection of readings to bring the text into the twenty-first century. In a new introduction, the editors reflect on the key arguments of the book's central thesis, refining them in light of more recent philosophical discourse. This edition includes important new readings by Kwame Gyekye, Oyèrónké Oy˘ewùmí, Paget Henry, Sylvia Wynter, Toni Morrison, Charles Mills, and Tommy Curry, as well as extensive suggestions for further reading.<br>

If you are reading on an e-reader, smartphone, or computer interface right now, consider how these words arrived before your eyes, how packets of data hopped through network nodes to become digitally rendered pages for your perusal. Data, whether text, image, or sound, moves so rapidly and transparently that we rarely consider the energizing of networks, the fueling of cultures.

The I is a subject, under this view, enjoying itself selfishly until it meets another person, the “other” who breaks into my closed realm, decenters me, but also gives me a new (moral) identity deeper and more fulfilling than before.

  Author(s): Boyd Gregory A.<br>
  Abstract: In an epic constructive investigation, The Crucifixion of the Warrior God addresses the tension between Scripture’s violent depictions of God and the non-violent, self-sacrificial God that was supremely revealed on the cross. Over two volumes, author Gregory A. Boyd develops a theological interpretation of Scripture that he labels a “cruciform hermeneutic," and he argues that this cruciform way of reading Scripture reframes its violent divine portraits in a way that subverts their violence and that discloses how they bear witness to the revelation of God’s non-violent love in the crucified Christ.<br>

This “polyphony in the parlor” is emblematic of the sometimes unexpected influences on Twain’s work; far from causing Twain to “write incoherently,” as it may have for Mrs. Clemens, the writer thrived on a plurality of voices and influences.

  Book Title: The humanities and the Irish university-Anomalies and opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Sullivan Michael<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university. Ireland was a deeply religious country throughout the twentieth century but the colleges of its National University never established a religion or theology department. The official first language of Ireland is Irish but the vast majority of teaching in the arts and humanities is in English. These are two of the anomalies that long constrained humanities education in Ireland. This book charts a history of responses to humanities education in the Irish context. Reading the work of John Henry Newman, Padraig Pearse, Sean O Tuama, Denis Donoghue, Declan Kiberd, Richard Kearney and others, it looks for an Irish humanities ethos. It compares humanities models in the US, France and Asia with those in Ireland in light of work by Immanuel Kant, Pierre Bourdieu and Jacques Derrida. It should appeal to those interested in Irish education and history.The first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university<br>

  Book Title: Sanctity as literature in late medieval Britain-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERNAU ANKE<br>
  Abstract: Explores how sanctity and questions of literariness are intertwined across a range of medieval genres.This collection explores some of the many ways in which sanctity was closely intertwined with the development of literary strategies across a range of writings in late medieval Britain. Rather than looking for clues in religious practices in order to explain such changes, or reading literature for information about sanctity, these essays consider the ways in which sanctity - as concept and as theme - allowed writers to articulate and to develop further their 'craft' in specific ways. While scholars in recent years have turned once more to questions of literary form and technique, the kinds of writings considered in this collection - writings that were immensely popular in their own time - have not attracted the same amount of attention as more secular forms. The collection as a whole offers new insights for scholars interested in form, style, poetics, literary history and aesthetics, by considering sanctity first and foremost as literature<br>

There can be no question that Jesus addressed his disciples and the larger circle of his fellow Jews in their own tongue, either Hebrew or Aramaic (or most likely, some combination of the two).

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

  Abstract: While mega-novel text is often intricately meaningful or experimental, sometimes it is just excessive and pointless. On the other hand, mega-novels also contain text that, though appearing to be cruft, turns out to be quite important. Letzler posits that this cruft requires readers to develop a sophisticated method of attentional modulation, allowing one to subtly distinguish between text requiring focused attention and text that must be skimmed or even skipped to avoid processing failures.
      The Cruft of Fictionshows how the attentional maturation prompted by reading mega-novels can help manage the information overload that increasingly characterizes contemporary life.<br>

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  Abstract: There is a value in recognizing the limits of reading, or the unreadable, in Holocaust literature.¹ My argument in support of “unreadability” depends on a conventional and presumptive view of contemporary reading: we read in order to experience, to feel, to understand, to learn from, to empathize with, to imitate, to be inspired by text. Reading at its most powerful is a deeply intuitive moment or series of moments of connection and understanding. It is precisely from this background

  Book Title: Divination and Human Nature-A Cognitive History of Intuition in Classical Antiquity<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Struck Peter T.<br>
  Abstract: Divination and Human Naturecasts a new perspective on the rich tradition of ancient divination-the reading of divine signs in oracles, omens, and dreams. Popular attitudes during classical antiquity saw these readings as signs from the gods while modern scholars have treated such beliefs as primitive superstitions. In this book, Peter Struck reveals instead that such phenomena provoked an entirely different accounting from the ancient philosophers. These philosophers produced subtle studies into what was an odd but observable fact-that humans could sometimes have uncanny insights-and their work signifies an early chapter in the cognitive history of intuition.<br>

  Abstract: The religious world represented in the sectarian Dead Sea Scrolls is one that assumes distinctive roles for women and men, as well as very particular understandings of acceptable gender dynamics and sexual norms. a feminist critical reading of these texts “against the grain,” however, reveals some surprising possibilities for women’s presence, participation, and authority in the communities associated with these texts. Such a reading also reveals significant dynamics of contestation around these social roles. awareness of the apparent power dynamics in the sectarian scrolls suggests that readers must be cautious in making historical claims with regard to the textual evidence.<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

  Author(s): Gilleard Chris<br>
  Abstract: How do we sustain agency and identity amidst the frailty of advanced old age? What role does care play in this process? Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by age and infirmity. It begins with a theoretical examination of the fourth age, interrogating notions of agency, identity and personhood, as well as the impact of frailty, abjection and ‘othering’. It then applies this analysis to issues of care. Exploring our collective hopes and fears concerning old age and the ends of people’s lives, this is essential reading on one of the biggest social issues of our time.Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by ageing, and the associated problems of mental and physical frailty in later life.<br>

  Book Title: Transmitters and Creators-Chinese Commentators and Commentaries on the Analects<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Makeham John<br>
  Abstract: The Analects (Lunyu) is one of the most influential texts in human history. As a putative record of Confucius’s (551–479 B.C.E.) teachings and a foundational text in scriptural Confucianism, this classic was instrumental in shaping intellectual traditions in China and East Asia until the early twentieth century. But no premodern reader read only the text of the Analects itself. Rather, the Analects was embedded in a web of interpretation that mediated its meaning. Modern interpreters of the Analects only rarely acknowledge this legacy of two thousand years of commentaries. How well do we understand prominent or key commentaries from this tradition? How often do we read such commentaries as we might read the text on which they comment? Many commentaries do more than simply comment on a text. Not only do they shape the reading of the text, but passages of text serve as pretexts for the commentator to develop and expound his own body of thought. This book attempts to redress our neglect of commentaries by analyzing four key works dating from the late second century to the mid-nineteenth century (a period substantially contemporaneous with the rise and decline of scriptural Confucianism): the commentaries of He Yan (ca. 190–249); Huang Kan (488–545); Zhu Xi (1130–1200); and Liu Baonan (1791–1855) and Liu Gongmian (1821–1880).<br>

To this end, Zhu outlined a core group of reading skills: “playing with the savor of the text” (

  Abstract: In this comprehensive study of the rhetoric, narrative patterns, and intellectual content of the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, David Schaberg reads these two collections of historical anecdotes as traces of a historiographical practice that flourished around the fourth century BCE among the followers of Confucius. He contends that the coherent view of early China found in these texts is an effect of their origins and the habits of reading they impose. Rather than being totally accurate accounts, they represent the efforts of a group of officials and ministers to argue for a moralizing interpretation of the events of early Chinese history and for their own value as skilled interpreters of events and advisers to the rulers of the day.<br>

  Abstract: Divine simplicity is not merely a contextual doctrine limited to patristic theology, nor is it more properly located in the scholastic theology of the Middle Ages. Having been a significant teaching in both the East and West, it was an important doctrine inherited by theologians as a way of both reading scripture and speaking of God. In this section, I will briefly examine the continued importance of divine simplicity in Pseudo-Dionysius, John of Damascus, Anselm, and Peter Lombard. After this, I will transition to the doctrine’s culmination in the theology of Thomas Aquinas. With the exception of Pseudo-Dionysius, there is<br>

  Abstract: The Gospel of Mark (or, for that matter, any text) may be read from different locations. Our attempt has been to enter imaginatively into the world in which the Gospel was composed and to hear its discourses as a first-century audience might have heard them. Twentieth-century historical critics brought questions to Mark that required that the discourses be fragmented to uncover their pre-Markan sources or traditions. Having fragmented the discourses, historical critics were then unable to read them as coherent speech acts. Our reading has sought to hear the discourses themselves, their distinct patterns and strategies, in terms of the<br>

  Book Title: Il ritmo del pensiero-Montale Sereni Zanzotto<br>
  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Barile Laura<br>
  Abstract: In questa raccolta di saggi Laura Barile affronta in tono narrativo e conversevole tre classici del Novecento accomunati dalla loro appartenenza alla poesia di pensiero: la conoscenza è infatti la chiave di volta della grande poesia di tutti i tempi, nel suo colloquio con le altre arti e con la filosofia. Queste pagine si interrogano su vari temi: come nel primo Montale il tempo della durata conviva col tempo dell’istante; ma si analizzano anche alcuni nessi fondamentali – ancora non segnalati – di Satura con certa poesia anglosassone. Si indaga, poi, sui romanzi modernisti letti e amati da Sereni e sul loro fermentare nella sua poesia, ma si approfondisce anche la sua profetica riflessione, in prosa e in poesia, sul revisionismo e sul potere del mercato, in una Francoforte sempre più metaforica. Emerge infine, assieme a molto altro, un tema che in vario modo coinvolge i tre poeti: come, e fino a che punto, il compito della poesia sia (come vorrebbe Zanzotto) la lode. Compito che implica, oggi più che mai, una pur stremata ricerca di senso nell’insensatezza della realtà in cui ci troviamo immersi. Il discorso critico che attraversa questo prisma multidimensionale muove, però, sempre dai testi, letti in close reading e allarga la ricerca alle fonti e ai nutrimenti: dai trucchi del teatro in musica, agli autori amati e genialmente usati, fino ai filosofi, vagliando la sperimentazione continua di forme e di lessico. Chiude il libro uno scritto sulla paradossale rimozione della Shoah dal comune sentire e dalla cultura europea dei primi anni del dopoguerra.<br>

  Abstract: This collection of essays studies the encounter between allegedly ahistorical concepts of narratology and eighteenth-century literature. It questions whether the general concepts of narratology are as such applicable to historically specific fields, or whether they need further specification. Furthermore, at issue is the question whether the theoretical concepts actually are, despite their appearance of ahistorical generality, derived from the historical study of a particular period and type of literature. In the essays such concepts as genre, plot, character, event, tellability, perspective, temporality, description, reading, metadiegetic narration, and paratext are scrutinized in the context of eighteenth-century texts. The writers include some of the leading theorists of both narratology and eighteenth-century literature.<br>

  Author(s): Thatamanil John<br>
  Abstract: Spiritual Grammar identifies a genre of religious literature that until now has not been recognized as such. In this surprising and theoretically nuanced study, F. Dominic Longo reveals how grammatical structures of language addressed in two medieval texts published nearly four centuries apart, from distinct religious traditions, offer a metaphor for how the self is embedded in spiritual reality. Reading The Grammar of Hearts (Nahw al-qulūb) by the great Sufi shaykh and Islamic scholar 'Abd al-Karīm al-Qushayrī (d. 1074) and Moralized Grammar (Donatus moralizatus) by Christian theologian Jean Gerson (d. 1429), Longo reveals how both authors use the rules of language and syntax to advance their pastoral goals. Indeed, grammar provides the two masters with a fresh way of explaining spiritual reality to their pupils and to discipline the souls of their readers in the hopes that their writings would make others adept in the grammar of the heart.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3scx">American Poetry</a><br>
  Abstract: In a lecture presented at the Library of Congress in 1948, T. S. Eliot acknowledges so early an acquaintance with Poe that he cannot be sure whether his own work has been influenced by him. He then distances himself from his predecessor by focusing on Poe’s relation to the French Symbolists Baudelaire, Mallarmé, and Valéry.¹ This detour through another country and another language is the standard reading of the Eliot-Poe connection: Poe’s insistence on the poem as a formal artifact, as well as his critical self-consciousness, influenced the French Symbolists, who in turn influenced Eliot. Clearly, Eliot shares the Symbolists’<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger's Estrangements-Language, Truth, and Poetry in the Later Writings<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
  Abstract: According to Bruns, the strangeness of Heidegger's later writings is a deliberate attempt to expose philosophy to what it cannot contain within its powers of description and explanation. Heidegger takes poetry more seriously than any philosopher since Plato, says Bruns. In his texts on language and poetry he reappropriates the ancient notion of poetry as enigma, the impermeable text that resists our efforts to lay bare its meaning or structure. What matters to Heidegger in these writings, Bruns explains, is the rift between poetry and thinking., where each is said to repose in its own darkness. Poetry moves thinking away from philosophy by turning the thinker into a wanderer, closer to listening than to reasoning, more at home with puns than with concepts. Bruns shows this to be no less true of Heidegger's later writings as he examines them for the way they resist conventional methods of reading.<br>

As Habermas says, “Communication does not belong to the basic vocabulary of this philosophy.”¹ By “work through” I mean roughly, or loosely, what my discipline calls a close reading that lends special attention to the language of the dark or recalcitrant text.

  Abstract: Westphal’s reading of Hegel reveals the political nature of his own philosophy. Moreover, Westphal’s struggle with Hegel, as we shall see, can also be seen as a struggle with modernity and its resultant political, economic, and religious structures. With these thoughts in mind, Westphal’s second book on Hegel, entitled
                  Hegel, Freedom, and Modernity, is a prime source, as Westphal shapes the book to highlight these struggles, hoping to shed light upon the insights Hegel can give us and where he goes astray. This chapter explores Westphal’s journey with Hegel by focusing on Westphal’s political (and therefore religious) critique of Hegel.<br>

  Book Title: Self-Understanding and Lifeworld-Basic Traits of a Phenomenological Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

Phenomenological inquiry is most often directed to our experience of the world, to sense experiences, to questions of reality and knowledge, and to a lesser extent to thinking and understanding. But when we, as philosophers trained in or engaged with the continental tradition, are steeped so heavily in the reading of texts, this experience of reading demands its own proper explication as<br>

  Abstract: On levinas’s reading, formal conceptions of time depict a neutral order within which we experience events and beings. These accounts correlatively naturalize a subject who comprehends and controls her surroundings. When Levinas identifies the deformalization of time as central to his philosophical work, he is thus engaged in the critique of the image of subjectivity presupposed by formal conceptions of time. Starting in the late 1960s, Levinas describes time’s “meaningful content somehow prior to form” as traumatic: a responsibility for the other imposed on the subject, which consciousness is always too late to assimilate as a phenomenon (OUJ 232).<br>

  Abstract: Part religious studies, part feminist theory, part philosophy, part indescribable: such is Numinous Subjects. Described by the author as 'a kaleidoscopic exploration of why three gendered figures of the sacred matter within western culture,' the experience of reading this text truly is akin to gazing through a constantly turning kaleidoscope. Images, concepts, phrases and quotes are continually revisited, recombined, though never repeated in quite the same way. From these tumbling constellations arises a new understanding and wary appreciation of the figures of the virgin, the mother, and the whore. Drawing on the insights of thinkers as diverse as Rudolph Otto, Julia Kristeva, Simone de Beauvoir, and Martin Buber, Numinous Subjects simultaneously expands and focuses our attention on the myth of the sacred and its implications for female subjects in western culture today.<br>

  Abstract: The term “patristic social ethics” may convey the impression that the Church Fathers—already an immensely varied group of individuals covering at least half a millennium—shared a number of systematic views on social issues. It seems to suggest that they held a set of norms and rules, which can be reconstructed through the careful reading of their sermons, letters, and dogmatic works. On such an understanding, patristic teaching on property, poverty, or usury, takes the form of a coherent, discrete body of doctrines. Such an approach might work well for theological topics, for example, the interpretation of the Trinity<br>

It should not surprise us, then, that we encounter at the heart of Hopscotch doubts very similar to those so important to Paradise Lost.

  Abstract: The year 1917 was a turning point for Heidegger. Prior to 1917, he never openly questioned the Roman Catholic/Scholastic appropriation of philosophical methods into theology. After 1917, Heidegger began to regard Scholasticism as the site of the hegemony of theoretical speculative-aesthetic concepts in Christianity and the consequent forgetting of factical Christian life. The catalyst in this reversal was Heidegger’s discovery of Protestantism, Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and above all, Luther. We know Heidegger was reading Luther as early as 1909, although evidence of an intensive study of Luther only appears ten years later.¹ Heidegger came to believe that Luther had correctly identified<br>

  Book Title: Mirages and Mad Beliefs-Proust the Skeptic<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Prendergast Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Proust was long the object of a cult in which the main point of reading his great novel
      In Search of Lost Timewas to find, with its narrator, a redemptive epiphany in a pastry and a cup of lime-blossom tea. We now live in less confident times, in ways that place great strain on the assumptions and beliefs that made those earlier readings possible. This has led to a new manner of reading Proust, against the grain. InMirages and Mad Beliefs, Christopher Prendergast argues the case differently, with the grain, on the basis that Proust himself was prey to self-doubt and found numerous, if indirect, ways of letting us know. Prendergast traces in detail the locations and forms of a quietly nondogmatic yet insistently skeptical voice that questions the redemptive aesthetic the novel is so often taken to celebrate, bringing the reader to wonder whether that aesthetic is but another instance of the mirage or the mad belief that, in other guises, figures prominently inIn Search of Lost Time. In tracing the modalities of this self-pressuring voice, Prendergast ranges far and wide, across a multiplicity of ideas, themes, sources, and stylistic registers in Proust's literary thought and writing practice, attentive at every point to inflections of detail, in a sustained account of Proust the skeptic for the contemporary reader.<br>

  Abstract: If Chapter 3 suggested that a Ricœurian reading of Marcel might be possible, this was also inspired by similarities identified between Marcel and Augustine, whose philosophy of time Ricœur drew upon to support his argument that phenomenological and cosmological time are incommensurable. If Augustine’s concern with time is philosophical,¹ however, it is also linked to his religious outlook — just as, this chapter will suggest, might be argued for Marcel. However, this theological aspect is rather neglected in Ricœur’s interpretation of Augustine. For Ricœur, God’s eternity in Book XI of the

  Abstract: Can someone else write my autobiography? The question challenges the conventional meaning of autobiography. And since writing an autobiography—in America, after Benjamin Franklin—often occurs with an awareness that the status of the work is bound up with the authority of its author, the notion of authorship also becomes troubled.¹ For instance, because an autobiography appears to be direct communication from its author, the very conditions of its presentation may suggest we are reading a true story, a mere record of what happened. Yet, like the life it aims to account for, autobiography is fashioned, a literary artifact, necessarily<br>

In addition to identifying with the artist as “countryman” and sharing with him the metaphoric implications of eyes “the color of a new axe blade” (756) and of a “sagging broken-backed cabin” (746), one should be able to catch the<br>

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Abstract Expressionism-Context and Critique<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Landau Ellen G.<br>
  Abstract: Abstract Expressionism is arguably the most important art movement in postwar America. Many of its creators and critics became celebrities, participating in heated public debates that were published in newspapers, magazines, and exhibition catalogues. This up-to-date anthology is the first comprehensive collection of key critical writings about Abstract Expressionism from its inception in the 1940s to the present day. Ellen G. Landau's masterful introduction presents and analyzes the major arguments and crucial points of view that have surrounded the movement decade by decade. She then offers a selection of readings, also organized by decade, including influential statements by such artists as Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock, and Barnett Newman as well as the commentary of diverse critics. Offering new insights into the development of Abstract Expressionism, this rich anthology also demonstrates the ongoing impact of this revolutionary and controversial movement. Reading Abstract Expressionism is essential for the library of any curator, scholar, or student of twentieth-century art.<br>

  Abstract: Like other disciplines in our universities, psychoanalysis has lately been reinterpreted as a hermeneutic discipline. Indeed, many traditional hermeneuts have singled out psychoanalysis, among the human sciences, as the exemplar of a hermeneutic discipline, and many psychoanalysts proclaim themselves converts to the hermeneutic reading of their discipline. An equally large number of psychoanalysts, however, repudiate that reading and reaffirm traditional understandings. The arguments for their repudiation are many, but in this book I am concerned with one in particular: the idea that, if patients were informed of the true nature of psychoanalysis on the hermeneutic reading, they would reject psychoanalysis<br>

Authorial theories of composition and reading are indeed relevant, but they should not be accepted so literally that they overly determine our understanding of the workings of the texts themselves.

  Abstract: Special EURO 10,- discount for our ABG readers: now EURO 24,50 instead of EURO 34,50Performing the Past is an investigation of the multiple social and culture practices through which Europeans have negotiated the space between their history and their memory over the past 200 years. In museums, in opera houses, in the streets, in the schools, in theatres, in films, on the internet and beyond, narratives about the past circulate today at a dizzying speed. Producing and selling them is big business; if the past is indeed a foreign country, there are tens of thousands of tourist agents, guides, and pundits around to help us on our way, for a fee, to be sure.This collection of essays by renowned scholars from, among others, Yale, Columbia, Amsterdam Oxford, Cambridge, New York University and the European University Institute in Florence, is essential reading for anyone interested in today's memory boom. Drawing on different national and disciplinary traditions, the authors ultimately engage us with the ways in which Europeans continue a venerable tradition of finding out who they are, and where they are going, by performing the past.<br>

  Book Title: Poetry as Survival-  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

  Abstract: Rather than place Coleridge in the narrative of rhetoric’s retreat and return, either in retreat as Richard Young does or in return as James Berlin does, Paul Kameen’s reading seems to place Coleridge elsewhere. Certainly Kameen is interested in the ways Coleridge can expand the field’s conceptions of rhetorical invention and the composing process, but his rearticulation of Coleridge goes beyond the revaluation of the romantic individual. If Coleridge is read as espousing a complex relationship among the world, the body, the mind, and writing, then his importance clearly goes beyond mystical genius.

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

  Abstract: A Self-Conscious Art is the first full-length study in English to attempt to deal with the formal complexities of Modiano’s work, by reading ‘against the grain’ of his self-professed ingenuousness. A detailed examination of his narratives shows the deeply postmodern nature of his writing. Parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, his narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This book is a timely introduction to the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists.<br>

  Abstract: What is the cultural identity of Europe? Are there specifically European values? Questions like these are at the centre of a considerable number of political and scholarly debates in contemporary Europe. In this international best-seller, a group of acclaimed thinkers – including Orlando Patterson, S. N. Eisenstadt, Mark Mazower and Wolfgang Schluchter – examine the most important innovations and culturally vital value traditions of Europe to produce an image of contemporary European self-understanding. The volume combines two possible approaches, examining both specific cultural traditions (‘Athens and Jerusalem’) and specific values (‘freedom’; ‘rationality’). Boasting some of the leading thinkers in Europe and edited by Hans Joas and Klaus Wiegandt, The Cultural Values of Europe will be required reading for anyone hoping to understand the common cultural ground in Europe.<br>

  Abstract: Derrida’s influence on, and intervention in, postcolonial criticism has always been provocative and highly controversial. One of the major philosophers of the twentieth century, Derrida invented a new and radical mode of reading that set out to unravel the metaphysical premises of ‘Western’ or Eurocentric thought, yet his resonance for the criticism of specific colonial systems remains a subject of dispute. His deconstruction of philosophical and political hierarchies, his scepticism towards the concept of ‘the West’, and, according to thinkers such as Bhabha and Spivak, his persistent interest in marginality and eccentricity have defined the very tools of postcolonial criticism.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

  Abstract: A collection of new essays exploring all aspects of one of the most intriguing and controversial English poets, the seventeenth-century libertine the Earl of Rochester. Different sections focus on sexual politics, on the poetry of intellect, and on Rochester and his contemporaries. The aim of the book is to read Rochester and to open up the poems to further reading. Rochester’s personal notoriety is in a complex relationship to his writing and to the personality he created for himself through that writing. These essays offer a fresh reassessment of the range and quality of a writer only recently widely available, who is currently becoming visible as one of the great writers of his century.<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  Abstract: Two notions, rooted in the rubrics of biblical interpretation in general and reading strategy in particular, form the conceptual framework and specific directives for this endeavor.

  Abstract: Perhaps no thinker in twentieth-century Japan better represents the interface between psychology and philosophy than Kimura Bin. While maintaining his psychiatric practice and publishing widely on abnormal psychology, particularly on schizophrenia and depersonalization, his wider philosophical interests are evident from his early works. In foray after foray into the mysteries of the self—its construction and its breakdown, its awareness and its scotosis—Kimura is not an armchair philosopher but a doctor engaged in the experiences of his patients. If there is one constant theme running through his reading of twentieth-century philosophers, it is the conviction that a true phenomenology<br>

  Book Title: On Diary-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DURNIN KATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: On Diary is the second collection in English of the groundbreaking and profoundly influential work of one of the best-known and provocative theorists of autobiography and diary. Ranging from the diary’s historical origins to its pervasive presence on the Internet, from the spiritual journey of the sixteenth century to the diary of Anne Frank, and from the materials and methods of diary writing to the question of how diaries end, these essays display Philippe Lejeune’s expertise, eloquence, passion, and humor as a commentator on the functions, practices, and significance of keeping or reading a diary. Lejeune is a leading European critic and theorist of diary and autobiography. His landmark essay, "The Autobiographical Pact," has shaped life writing studies for more than thirty years, and his many books and essays have repeatedly opened up new vistas for scholarship. As Michael Riffaterre notes, "Lejeune’s work on autobiography is the most original, powerful, effective approach to a difficult subject. . . . His style is very personal, lively. It grabs the reader as scholarship rarely does. Lejeune’s erudition and methodology are impeccable." Two substantial introductory essays by Jeremy Popkin and Julie Rak place Lejeune’s work within its critical and theoretical traditions and comment on his central importance within the fields of life writing, literary genetic studies, and cultural studies.<br>

  Book Title: Out of the Margins-The Rise of Chinese Vernacular Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Ge Liangyan<br>
  Abstract: The novel Water Margin (Shuihu zhuan), China's earliest full-length narrative in vernacular prose, first appeared in print in the sixteenth century. The tale of one hundred and eight bandit heroes evolved from a long oral tradition; in its novelized form, it played a pivotal role in the rise of Chinese vernacular fiction, which flourished during the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) periods. Liangyan Ge's multidimensional study considers the evolution of Water Margin and the rise of vernacular fiction against the background of the vernacularization of premodern Chinese literature as a whole. This gradual and arduous process, as the book convincingly shows, was driven by sustained contact and interaction between written culture and popular orality. Ge examines the stylistic and linguistic features of the novel against those of other works of early Chinese vernacular literature (stories, in particular), revealing an accretion of features typical of different historical periods and a prolonged and cumulative process of textualization. In addition to providing a meticulous philological study, his work offers a new reading of the novel that interprets some of its salient characteristics in terms of the interplay between audience, storytellers, and men of letters associated with popular orality.<br>

  Abstract: Traces of a Streamis a showcase for nineteenth-century African American women, and particularly elite women, as a group of writers who are currently underrepresented in rhetorical scholarship. Royster has formulated both an analytical theory and an ideological perspective that are useful in gaining a more generative understanding of literate practices as a whole and the practices of African American women in particular. Royster tells a tale of rhetorical prowess, calling for alternative ways of seeing, reading, and rendering scholarship as she seeks to establish a more suitable place for the contributions and achievements of African American women writers.<br>

  Abstract: In 1983, I discovered that African American women write essays, and it was then I began to notice features of this type of writing that served ultimately to shape and direct the writing of this book. What prompted these insights was my reading of Alice Walker’s collection of previously published and unpublished essays, entitled, after the best-known essay in the group,In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens: Womanist Prose. First among the distinctions of this volume is that it was published during a time when works by African American women were being celebrated as a literary “renaissance.” By the 1980s<br>

  Abstract: We should not be surprised, while reading the autobiographies of fellow Americans, to encounter religious self-disclosures. After all, roughly 85 percent of Americans self-identify as religious. In addition, religion is so pervasive in our society that the life of any American is likely to include references to religion in some form and degree or other. American autobiographies that include religious disclosures are not exceptional, then. Conversely, autobiographies that include religious self-disclosures are potentially engaging to American readers because they themselves are likely to have had to deal with religion as part of their pasts, their current interactions, or their thoughts<br>

  Book Title: Locating the Destitute-Space and Identity in Caribbean Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Radović Stanka<br>
  Abstract: While postcolonial discourse in the Caribbean has drawn attention to colonialism's impact on space and spatial hierarchy, Stanka Radović asks both how ordinary people as "users" of space have been excluded from active and autonomous participation in shaping their daily spatial reality and how they challenge this exclusion. In a comparative interdisciplinary reading of anglophone and francophone Caribbean literature and contemporary spatial theory, she focuses on the house as a literary figure and the ways that fiction and acts of storytelling resist the oppressive hierarchies of colonial and neocolonial domination. The author engages with the theories of Henri Lefebvre, Michel Foucault, and contemporary critical geographers, in addition to selected fiction by V. S. Naipaul, Patrick Chamoiseau, Beryl Gilroy, and Rafaël Confiant, to examine the novelists' construction of narrative "houses" to reclaim not only actual or imaginary places but also the very conditions of self-representation.<br>

The author combines close reading, reception study, and postcolonial theory to present an insightful survey of the literary connections among these autobiographers as well as a useful point of departure for further exploration of the genre itself, of the role of reception studies in postcolonial criticism, and of the stance that postcolonial francophone writers choose to take regarding their communities of origin.<br>

As we have seen, the Stoics and their allegorical followers present the first definitive evidence of this shift, though it was likely in place before them.

  Book Title: The Undivine Comedy-Detheologizing Dante<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): BAROLINI TEODOLINDA<br>
  Abstract: Accepting Dante's prophetic truth claims on their own terms, Teodolinda Barolini proposes a "detheologized" reading as a global new approach to the
      Divine Comedy. Not aimed at excising theological concerns from Dante, this approach instead attempts to break out of the hermeneutic guidelines that Dante structured into his poem and that have resulted in theologized readings whose outcomes have been overdetermined by the poet. By detheologizing, the reader can emerge from this poet's hall of mirrors and discover the narrative techniques that enabled Dante to forge a true fiction. Foregrounding the formal exigencies that Dante masked as ideology, Barolini moves from the problems of beginning to those of closure, focusing always on the narrative journey. Her investigation--which treats such topics as the visionary and the poet, the One and the many, narrative and time--reveals some of the transgressive paths trodden by a master of mimesis, some of the ways in which Dante's poetic adventuring is indeed, according to his own lights, Ulyssean.<br>

Due to our habit of conflating theCommedia’sform with its content, the exegetical tradition has produced a theologized reading of the third canticle that portrays it as cloyingly serene (no doubt a factor in its undeserved reputation as boring). In recent years, the old critical commonplace of a serene and problem-free third canticle has been given a metapoetic twist; we hear now about the difficulties of writing theInferno, difficulties that presumably lessen as the poem proceeds.

Seyhan identifies in American multiculturalism critical clues for analyzing new cultural formations in Europe and maintains that Germany's cultural transformation suggests new ways of reading the American literary mosaic. Her approach, however, extends well beyond these two literatures. She creates a critical map of a "third geography," where a transnational, multilingual literary movement is gathering momentum.<br>

The difficulty in part lies in the fact that the terms “equipment” and “meditation” are used in a distinctive technical sense. Furthermore, why one would want to transform “logos” into “ethos” equally requires explanation. Hence the reader is alerted that reading this book will require a certain patience.

This is really another way of asking why people read autobiographies, a question intimately linked to the question of why people write them. There seems to be no doubt that readers do read autobiographies differently from other kinds of texts, especially from works they take to be “fictions.” All who have studied the reading of autobiography agree that reference lies at the heart<br>

                  The Adventures of the Dialectiche repeats once again the litany of requirements that he places on truly political thought: it begins with a probabilistic reading of events, it needs a philosophy of history, it treats people statistically, it aims at success (AD 239, 9, 226, 251, tr. 163, 3, 154, 172). Chastising Sartre for his notion of “pure action,” Merleau-Ponty reminds him that political actors cannot use the fact that history is “overflowing with meaning” to justify an arbitrary perspective<br>

  Abstract: Damage is the subject of this dialogue. Plato is concerned with two sorts of damage. One is the damage done by lovers in the name of desire. The other is the damage done by writing and reading in the name of communication. Why does he set these two sorts of damage beside one another? Plato appears to believe that they act on the soul in analogous ways and violate reality by the same kind of misapprehension. The action of eros does harm to the beloved when the lover takes a certain controlling attitude, an attitude whose most striking feature is<br>

  Book Title: Poetics of Reading-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMMERS INGE CROSMAN<br>
  Abstract: What happens when we read novels and how do we make sense of them? Inge Wimmers explores these questions by developing a flexible poetics of reading that generously opens up the interpretive space between reader and text, while drawing on current theories of reading and combining rhetorical, pragmatic, and phenomenological approaches. "Poetics," here, is extended beyond the study of purely textual features to structures of exchange between text and reader. In a discussion of four major French novels from the seventeenth century to the present, the author not only sets up a broad-based poetics but also makes important contributions to contemporary issues in the study of narrative. Wimmers introduces the concept of multiple, interlocking frames of reference that allows for the integration of diverse critical perspectives. Analyzing La Princesse de Cleves, Madame Bovary, A la recherche du temps perdu, and Projet pour une revolution a New York, she shows how texts provide some frames of reference, while others are produced by the reader's disposition and cultural milieu.<br>

  New Directions in the Reading of Narrative Fiction from:

  Abstract: What is it to read novels? This is the question asked at the outset of this study. It is clear by now that there is no one simple answer. Readings differ depending on the kind of novel being read and the reader’s purpose, interests, and ideology. By opening the interpretive space between reader and text to include both text interpretation and self-interpretation, the frames of reference that come into play are multiplied. Moreover, the emphasis in recent theories of reading on emotional response—in particular the enjoyment readers get from taking an active part—opens up new directions for a<br>

Instead of the expected denouement there is an impossible, or paradoxical, outcome. Only a critical reading, such as the one performed in “

  Book Title: The Life of Roman Republicanism-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): CONNOLLY JOY<br>
  Abstract: With an original combination of close reading and political theory, Joy Connolly argues that Cicero, Sallust, and Horace inspire fresh thinking about central concerns of contemporary political thought and action. These include the role of conflict in the political community, especially as it emerges from class differences; the necessity of recognition for an equal and just society; the corporeal and passionate aspects of civic experience; citizens' interdependence on one another for senses of selfhood; and the uses and dangers of self-sovereignty and fantasy. Putting classicists and political theorists in dialogue, the book also addresses a range of modern thinkers, including Kant, Hannah Arendt, Stanley Cavell, and Philip Pettit. Together, Connolly's readings construct a new civic ethos of advocacy, self-criticism, embodied awareness, imagination, and irony.<br>

  Book Title: What's Happened to the Humanities?-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kernan Alvin<br>
  Abstract: This volume of specially commissioned original essays presents the thoughts of some of the most distinguished commentators within the American academy on the fundamental changes that have taken place in the humanities in the latter part of the twentieth century. In the transformation of American higher education from the university to the "demoversity," the humanities have become a less and less important part of education, a matter established by a statistical appendix and elaborated on in several of the essays. The individual essays offer close observations into how the humanities have been affected by declining academic status, by demographic shifts, by reductions in financial support, and by changing communication technology. They also explore the effect of these forces on books, libraries, and the phenomenology of reading in the age of images. When basic conditions change, theory follows, and several essays trace the appearance and effect of new relativistic epistemologies in the humanities. Social institutions change as well in such circumstances, and the volume concludes with studies of the new social arrangements that have developed in the humanities in recent years: the attack on professionalism and the effort to transform the humanities into the social conscience of academia and even of the nation as a whole.<br>

Aphorisms deployed along with another genre serve both as a component of the overall text and as text in and of themselves. Given their differentiated identity, aphorisms display idiosyncratic powers of evocation peculiar to the genre. Because of its peculiar behaviour in relation to the narrated chain of events, aphorism often demands the reader’s focused attention.

  Abstract: Karsten Harries provides a new and long-overdue reading of Martin Heidegger's well-known essay "Building Dwelling Thinking." Donald Kunze and Stephen Parcell consider possibilities of meaningful architectural space for a visual culture, continuing themes they addressed in Chora 1. Further reflections on the spaces of literature, cinema, and architecture include an interview with French writer and film maker Alain Robbe-Grillet and articles by Dagmar Motycka Weston on the surrealist city, Tracey Eve Winton on the museum as a paradigmatic modern building, and Terrance Galvin on spiritual space in the works of Jean Cocteau. Jean-Pierre Chupin and Bram Ratner explore historical themes in their essays on French Renaissance architect Philibert de l'Orme and the Jewish myth of the Golem. Gregory Caicco addresses ethical questions in his essay on the Greek agora and the death of Socrates, as does Lily Chi in her meditation on the critical issue of use in architectural works. A concern with architectural representation and generative strategies for the making of architecture is present throughout, especially in the essay by Joanna Merwood on the provocative House by British artist Rachel Whiteread.<br>

Drawing on genre and narratological theory, she outlines the development of the "fiction-elegy" as a sub-genre and suggests that the modernist writings of Woolf and Joyce are paradigmatic examples of the form. She then uses these paradigms as suggestive "reading models" for the interpretation of works by Gallant, Munro, and other contemporary fiction-elegists. Figuring Grief offers new readings of specific works and suggests that new ways of reading are both demanded and rewarded by a poetics of elegy.<br>

  Abstract: The most common reading of the parable of the Friend at Midnight (Luke 11:1-10) holds that it is about generosity, the requirement to give to those who ask, and the trust that God will supply one’s own needs. Social-science commentary, as exemplified by Bruce Malina and Richard Rohrbaugh, adds the further dimensions of patronage and hospitality in the context of honor and shame: “Thus the petitioner threatens to expose the potential shamelessness of the sleeper. By morning the entire village would know of his refusal to provide hospitality. He thus gives in to avoid public exposure as a shameless person.”¹<br>

  Book Title: Reading Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Reading is one of the basic skills a student needs. But reading is not just an activity of the eyes and the brain. Reading Theologically, edited by Eric D. Barreto, brings together eight seminary educators from a variety of backgrounds to explore what it means to be a reader in a seminary context--to read theologically. Reading theologically involves a specific minset adn posture towards texts and ideas, people and communities alike. Reading theologically is not just about academic skill building but about the formation of a ministerial leader who can engage scholarship critically, interpret Scripture and tradition faithfully, welcome different perspectives, and help lead others to do the same. This brief, readable, edited volume emphasizes the vital skills, habits, practices, and values involved in reading theologically. Reading Theologically is a vital resource for students beginning the seminary process and professors of introductory level seminary courses.<br>

  Abstract: Having examined the arguments put forward by the Radical Orthodox theologians in chapter 1, the ways in which the Scotus Story has been appropriated in chapter 2, and the critiques of that reading of John Duns Scotus in chapter 3, it is necessary for us to explore the doctrine of univocity as Scotus himself presents it. Following the substantial critique leveled against the Radical Orthodoxy reading and subsequent interpretation of this theory of univocity, it is important to present a reading of the subtle doctor’s work that provides a more accurate account of Scotus’s position in contrast to the Radical<br>

  Book Title: Walking with the Mud Flower Collective-God's Fierce Whimsy and Dialogic Theological Method<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Jost Stina Busman<br>
  Abstract: Arguing for a retrieval of the landmark work, God’s Fierce Whimsy, Stina Busman Jost establishes the critical importance of this volume for the construction of a dialogic theological method. This is accomplished through a close reading of God’s Fierce Whimsy in which the author identifies key methodological characteristics informing the volume’s formation. Critical importance also is established through interviews with the volume’s authors, the Mud Flower Collective—which included Katie G. Cannon, Beverly W. Harrison, Carter Heyward, Ada María Isasi-Díaz, Bess B. Johnson (Delores Williams), Mary D. Pellauer, and Nancy D. Richardson. Undergirding this endeavor is a recognition of the theoretical importance of difference to the project of theological construction and the vital form of the dialogic as constitutive of theological practice; this is carried forward through engagement with the pivotal theorists Martin Buber and Mikhail Bakhtin, who helped pioneer the philosophical and literary critical importance of otherness, difference, and dialogue. Finally, the author constructively engages recent developments in feminist theologies and postcolonial theories—ultimately making the argument that a dialogic theological method is relevant for the doing of theology today.<br>

  Book Title: The Future of the Word-An Eschatology of Reading<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

That eschatological future—the glorious plenitude of the community of the new creation—is texts’ expansion of meaning within the expanding love of the Trinity for the glory of God.

  Book Title: Antiochene Theoria in the Writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret of Cyrus-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Perhai Richard J.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical scholars have often contrasted the exegesis of the early church fathers from the eastern region and “school” of Syrian Antioch against that of the school of Alexandria. The Antiochenes have often been described as strictly historical-literal exegetes in contrast to the allegorical exegesis of the Alexandrians. Patristic scholars now challenge those stereotypes, some even arguing that few differences existed between the two groups. This work agrees that both schools were concerned with a literal and spiritual reading. But, it also tries to show, through analysis of Theodore and Theodoret’s exegesis and use of the term theoria, that how they integrated the literal-theological readings often remained quite distinct from the Alexandrians. For the Antiochenes, the term theoria did not mean allegory, but instead stood for a range of perceptions—prophetic, christological, and contemporary. It is in these insights that we find the deep wisdom to help modern readers interpret Scripture theologically.<br>

  Book Title: A Politics of the Ordinary-  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Dumm Thomas L.<br>
  Abstract: In A Politics of the Ordinary, Thomas Dumm dramatizes how everyday life in the United States intersects with and is influenced by the power of events, on the one hand, and forces of conformity and normalcy on the other. Combining poststructuralist analysis with a sympathetic reading of a strain of American thought that begins with Emerson and culminates in the work of Stanley Cavell, A Politics of the Ordinary investigates incidents from everyday life, political spectacles, and popular culture. Whether juxtaposing reflections about boredom in rural New Mexico with Emerson's theory of constitutional amendment, Richard Nixon's letter of resignation with Thoreau's writings to overcome quiet desperation, or demonstrating how Disney's Toy Story allegorizes the downsizing of the American white-collar work force, Dumm's constant concern is to show how the ordinary is the primary source of the democratic political imagination.<br>

  Book Title: Keywords for Childrens Literature-  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Paul Lissa<br>
  Abstract: The study of children's literature and culture has been experiencing a renaissance, with vital new work proliferating across many areas of interest. Mapping this vibrant scholarship, Keywords for Children's Literature presents 49 original essays on the essential terms and concepts of the field. From Aesthetics to Young Adult, an impressive, multidisciplinary cast of scholars explores the vocabulary central to the study of children's literature. Following the growth of his or her word, each author traces its branching uses and meanings, often into unfamiliar disciplinary territories: Award-winning novelist Philip Pullman writes about Intentionality, Education expert Margaret Meek Spencer addresses Reading, literary scholar Peter Hunt historicizes Children's Literature, Psychologist Hugh Crago examines Story, librarian and founder of the influential Child_Lit litserv Michael Joseph investigates Liminality. The scope, clarity, and interdisciplinary play between concepts make this collection essential reading for all scholars in the field. In the spirit of Raymond Williams' seminal Keywords, this book is a snapshot of a vocabulary of children's literature that is changing, expanding, and ever unfinished.<br>

  Book Title: Re-imagining child protection-Towards humane social work with families<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Morris Kate<br>
  Abstract: Why has the language of the child and of child protection become so hegemonic? What is lost and gained by such language? Who is being protected, and from what, in a risk society? Given that the focus is overwhelmingly on those families who are multiply deprived, do services reinforce or ameliorate such deprivations? And is it ethical to remove children from their parents in a society riven by inequalities? This timely book challenges a child protection culture that has become mired in muscular authoritarianism towards multiply deprived families. It calls for family-minded humane practice where children are understood as relational beings, parents are recognized as people with needs and hopes and families as carrying extraordinary capacities for care and protection. The authors, who have over three decades of experience as social workers, managers, educators and researchers in England, also identify the key ingredients of just organizational cultures where learning is celebrated. This important book will be required reading for students on qualifying and post-qualifying courses in child protection, social workers, managers, academics and policy makers.<br>

  Abstract: The notion of a ‘crime against humanity’ in international law after World War II led to a revision of the reading of genocides, massacres, mass deportations and dictatorships. The massive destruction of European Jews and other groups committed by Nazism opened the way to rethinking colonial slavery, colonial crimes and politics of segregation within the frame of that notion. There was an increased need for memorials which honoured the victims and their suffering, recognised that a crime had been committed and invited heightened civic awareness and action. The memorial acquired a new meaning in the public space. It was conceived<br>

  Abstract: Reading the

The crux here is the extent to which history itself which history itself (or a species of history) comes to an end with the return of the son of prophecy. That is, does the temportality of prophyecy, in its collapse of present, past and future, necessarity imply a theological reading or a<br>

  Abstract: Jews have trouble enough dealing with Jesus, not in the Christian reading life and teachings, with which we can identify, but in the claim that, in a unique way, he is God’s only begotten son. What, then, are we to make of Mary? Mary, after all, is called Mother of God and revered and loved by Roman Catholics; she is bearer of profound religious sentiments indeed. But if we cannot grasp how any one man is more God’s son than any other, then how can we make sense of how any one woman is more God’s mother than any other?<br>

  Author(s) Porter Robert<br>
  Abstract: In Chapter 1, ‘Poststructuralism and Modern European Philosophy’, Lumsden emphasises the connection between poststructuralism and post-Kantian idealism, Hegel in particular. Key here is Heidegger’s reading of the history of philosophy and how it has, implicitly and explicitly, functioned as the interpretative frame through which poststructuralism itself approaches the history of philosophy. This, for Lumsden, explains why Hegel, at least in the case of Deleuze and Derrida, is the confluence and culmination of all the problematic strains that run through modern philosophy.<br>

Laruelle’s reading of Heidegger follows the late Heidegger in treating the thought of the ontological difference of Being and beings as still determined and thus relatively constrained by the history of metaphysics.

  Book Title: The Ethics of Deconstruction-Derrida and Levinas<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Critchley Simon<br>
  Abstract: The Ethics of Deconstruction, Simon Critchley's first book, was originally published to great acclaim in 1992. It was the first book to argue for the ethical turn in Derrida's work and to show as powerfully as possible how deconstruction has persuasive ethical consequences that are vital to our thinking through of questions of politics and democracy. Rather than being concerned with deconstruction in terms of the contradictions inherent in any text - an approach typical of the early Derrida and those in literary criticism aiming to extract a critical method for an application to literature - Critchley concerns himself with the philosophical context necessary for an understanding of the ethics of deconstructive reading. Far from being some sort of value-free nihilism or textual free-play, Critchley showed the ethical impetus that was driving Derrida's work. His claim was that Derrida's understanding of ethics has to be understood in relation to his engagement with the work of Levinas and the book lays out the details of their philosophical confrontation.<br>

What is the political moment in deconstruction? Can deconstruction provide an account of justice and a just polity?

  Author(s): Childs Peter<br>
  Abstract: Being able to analyse different types of text is an essential skill for students of literature. Texts is a new kind of book which shows students how to use literary theory to approach a wide range of literary, cultural and media texts of the kind studied on today’s courses. These texts range from short stories, autobiographies, political speeches, websites and lyrics to films such as The Matrix and Harry Potter and from television’s Big Brother to shopping malls, celebrities, and rock videos.Each chapter combines an introduction to the text and aspects of its critical reception with an analysis using one of sixteen key approaches, from established angles like feminism, postcolonial studies and deconstruction to newer areas such as ecocriticism, trauma theory, and ethical criticism. Each chapter also indicates alternative ways of reading the text by drawing on other critical approaches. Texts:*is the first student guide to examine visual, virtual and performance texts alongside written texts reflecting the broadening range of the contemporary literature syllabus*demonstrates clearly how students can analyse a familiar text in different ways, a core skill which many find difficult*provides a student introduction to contemporary culture via well known popular texts and literary theories.<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

We saw that, although Derrida’s worries about what Merleau-Ponty means by ‘presence’ and ‘intuitionism’ do provide cause for concern, there is ‘another’ Merleau-Ponty (to whom Derrida alludes but does not explore at any length) who is not prey to the same accusations. We also began to see that Derrida’s reading rests substantially on a particular understanding of the notion of ‘contact’ as immediate proximity, which it is by no means clear that Merleau-Ponty<br>

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

  Abstract: This study began with a consideration of dimensions of the literary and cultural horizon of expectations that are often brought to bear when encountering travels in contemporary literature; that is, what we may bring with us upon ‘arrival’. Before closing, it may be appropriate to offer a consideration of what we take with us when we ‘leave’. The question is not so much, as is often the case in studies in travel writing, ‘where next?’ This study has attempted to question a model of reading travels as exclusively or primarily documents of geographical discovery, rendered precarious by the increasingly full<br>

  Book Title: Material Inscriptions-Rhetorical Reading in Practice and Theory<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Warminski Andrzej<br>
  Abstract: This monograph provides readings of literary and philosophical texts that work through the rhetoric of tropes to the material inscription at the origin of these texts. The book focuses on the practice and pedagogical value of rhetorical reading. Its readings follow an itinerary from poetic texts (such as those by Wordsworth and Keats) through theoretical or philosophical texts (by Descartes and Nietzsche) to narrative fiction (by Henry James). The book also contains two essays on Paul de Man and literary theory and an interview on the topic of "Deconstruction at Yale." All three of these latter texts are explicitly about the inescapable function and importance of the rhetoric of tropes for any critical reading or literary study worthy of the name. As Andrzej Warminski demonstrates, ‘rhetorical reading’ is a species of ‘deconstructive reading’—in the full ‘de Manian’ sense—but one that, rather than harkening back to a past over and done with, would open the texts to a different future. Key Features: New readings of texts by Wordsworth, Keats, Descartes, Nietzsche, and Henry James Essays and an interview on Paul de Man and ‘Deconstruction at Yale’ Reflects on and exemplifies the pedagogical value of ‘de Manian’ rhetorical reading Attempts to open a future for 'deconstructive' or 'de Manian' reading<br>

  Author(s) Warminski Andrzej<br>
  Abstract: A reading of a Henry James story in an issue on French symbolism may seem an odd juxtaposition.¹ Certain thematic links are, of course, possible: although James wrote very little on authors whom one could count among the French symbolists, he did write a great deal on what has been called “symbolism” in the American literary tradition (a tradition in which his own work takes a place).² But the possibility of such loose linking already points up a certain symptomatic instability in the very term symbolism itself. That is, the term symbolism would want to serve as a convenient label<br>

  Abstract: The book offers a reading of a group of authors and texts dating from 1750 to the early twentieth century and used as examples to illustrate a mode of reading and of interpretation. The most extensive reading offered is that of Rousseau, who is considered at length in an overview that includes the major fictional, political and confessional writings. In the case of Proust and of Rilke, the corpus is much less extended, although it claims to be representative of structures that recur in the work as a whole. No such claim is made for Nietzsche, where the reading of<br>

  Book Title: The Immaterial Book-Reading and Romance in Early Modern England<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall-Randell Sarah<br>
  Abstract: In romances-Renaissance England's version of the fantasy novel-characters often discover books that turn out to be magical or prophetic, and to offer insights into their readers' selves.
      The Immaterial Bookexamines scenes of reading in important romance texts across genres: Spenser'sFaerie Queene,Shakespeare'sCymbelineandThe Tempest,Wroth'sUrania,and Cervantes'Don Quixote. It offers a response to "material book studies" by calling for a new focus on imaginary or "immaterial" books and argues that early modern romance authors, rather than replicating contemporary reading practices within their texts, are reviving ancient and medieval ideas of the book as a conceptual framework, which they use to investigate urgent, new ideas about the self and the self-conscious mind.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter sets out the theoretical model for the book: a model explaining the conditioned power of theories. In order to establish my theory, I aim to use hermeneutics—though with a slight twist. Hermeneutics is usually understood as the art of reading and interpreting texts. I want to stress, however, the dual nature of hermeneutics. Although hermeneutics indeed interprets texts, it is also a more active intellectual endeavor of interpreting reality once reality is conceived as an unwritten text. That is not to say that reality is nothing but a text or even to claim it is a text<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters, I have defined protoarchaeological narratives as those in which the past is conceptualized in a negotiation between empirical observation and linguistic representation in a variety of ancient Greek genres. I have also suggested that reading—both as a conceptual category and as a practice—functions within these narratives as an acknowledgment that the past is constituted in what can no longer be seen. To return again to Herodotus’ metaphor, reading refers to the past as a congeries of narrativized objects and events that fades with time. In this epilogue, I explore the ontological and epistemological implications<br>

  Book Title: Sufi Narratives of Intimacy-Ibn 'Arabī, Gender, and Sexuality<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): Shaikh Saʿdiyya<br>
  Abstract: Thirteenth-century Sufi poet, mystic, and legal scholar Muhyi al-Din ibn al-'Arabi gave deep and sustained attention to gender as integral to questions of human existence and moral personhood. Reading his works through a critical feminist lens, Sa'diyya Shaikh opens fertile spaces in which new and creative encounters with gender justice in Islam can take place. Grounding her work in Islamic epistemology, Shaikh attends to the ways in which Sufi metaphysics and theology might allow for fundamental shifts in Islamic gender ethics and legal formulations, addressing wide-ranging contemporary challenges including questions of women's rights in marriage and divorce, the politics of veiling, and women's leadership of ritual prayer.Shaikh deftly deconstructs traditional binaries between the spiritual and the political, private conceptions of spiritual development and public notions of social justice, and the realms of inner refinement and those of communal virtue. Drawing on the treasured works of Sufism, Shaikh raises a number of critical questions about the nature of selfhood, subjectivity, spirituality, and society to contribute richly to the prospects of Islamic feminism as well as feminist ethics more broadly.<br>

  Book Title: Narratives of Agency-Self-Making in China, India, and Japan<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Dissanayake Wimal<br>
  Abstract: This multidisciplinary collection underlines the importance of understanding the operations of human agency-defined here as the ability to exert power, specifically in resistance to ideological pressure. In particular, the contributors emphasize the historical and cultural conditions that facilitate the production of agency in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures of China, India, and Japan. In Narratives of Agency, scholars from a variety of disciplines argue that traditional Western approaches to the study of these cultures have unduly focused on the pervasive influence of family and clan (China), caste and fatalism (India), and groupism (Japan). This tendency has been exacerbated by modern critical approaches, such as postmodernism and poststructuralism, that not only are increasingly popular in studying these cultures but also de-emphasize the role of the individual. The resultant undermining of the notion of human agency tends to give short shrift to the very real individual differences between groups and ignores questions of personal desire and intentionality. These essays remind us that members of a community have to make personal choices, struggle and interact with others, argue about positions, and confront new challenges, all of which involve intentionality and human agency. A new look at a topic central to cross-cultural understanding, Narratives of Agency will be essential reading for those interested in China, India, Japan, and the world beyond._x000B_ _x000B_Contributors: Richard G.

  Abstract: The

But Dante’s small book is forward-, rather than backward-looking; Dante saw his poetry as the culmination and fulfillment of his predecessors’ poetics, and as a promise of something greater, as completing their works in the same way that the New Testament was thought to have completed the Old—a figural reading of literary<br>

  Abstract: The concept of pathology derives from ancient medicine, where it refers to the doctrine of kinds and causes of illness. According to Galen, the pathological is what deviates from “the normal course of nature” (Seidler 1989, 13). Discourse about social pathologies, in turn, stems from the metaphorical transferring of this medical concept onto societies—which are treated as if they were organisms that can be sick or healthy. Habermas’s reading of Freud, in

  Book Title: Neopoetics-The Evolution of the Literate Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

  Abstract: Historians correctly warn their political scientist friends against the danger of an overly present-centered reading of the stakes of politics. For example, the issues roiling French politics must be understood within the symbolic framework inaugurated by the rupture begun in 1789. Seemingly unrelated actions, whose motivation seems to depend only on simple self-interest, may acquire a meaning that their authors have not consciously intended. Similarly, German politics is framed by the symbolic context created by both Frederick the Great’s early legal codification of the Allgemeines Landgesetz and by the failure of the 1848 revolution to institute a liberal parliamentary regime<br>

  Book Title: Reading the-The Literary Aims of a Theravada Buddhist History<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Scheible Kristin<br>
  Abstract: Reading the Mahavamsaadvocates a new, literary approach to this text by revealing its embedded reading advice (to experiencesamvegaandpasada) and affective work of metaphors (the Buddha's dharma as light) and salient characters (nagas). Kristin Scheible argues that theMahavamsarequires a particular kind of reading. In the text's proem, special instructions draw readers to the metaphor of light and thenagas, or salient snake-beings, of the first chapter.Nagasare both model worshippers and unworthy hoarders of Buddha's relics. As nonhuman agents, they challenge political and historicist readings of the text. Scheible sees these slippery characters and the narrative's potent and playful metaphors as techniques for refocusing the reader's attention on the text's emotional aims. Her work explains theMahavamsa's central motivational role in contemporary Sri Lankan Buddhist and nationalist circles. It also speaks broadly to strategies of reading religious texts and to the internal and external cues that give such works lives beyond the page.<br>

Shoulson's analysis moves back and forth between Milton's writings and Jewish writings of the first five centuries of the Common Era, collectively known as midrash. In exploring the historical and literary implications of these connections, Shoulson shows how Milton's text can inform a more nuanced reading of midrash just as midrash can offer new insights intoParadise Lost.<br>

It is not unreasonable to assert, in this respect, that Heidegger’s reading is the systematic counterpoint to Cohen’s. The opposition can be read (1) in their understandings of Kant’s problematic, (2) in their explanations of knowledge, (3) in the importance they accord to one or the other of the Critique of Pure Reason’s two editions, and (4) in the meaning that each thinks should be<br>

  Book Title: The Last Cannibals-A South American Oral History<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

This fugue is seeded with possibilities that are waiting for us, its listeners, to develop them. Some are dead ends-viruses that can lead only to a monolithic, monotonous misunderstanding of history.

  Abstract: The dynamic fields of the history of the book and the sociology of the text are the areas this volume investigates, bringing together ten specially commissioned essays that between them demonstrate a range of critical and material approaches to medieval, early modern, and digital books and texts. They scrutinize individual medieval manuscripts to illustrate how careful re-reading of evidence permits a more nuanced apprehension of production, and reception across time; analyse metaphor for our understanding of the Byzantine book; examine the materiality of textuality from Beowulf to Pepys and the digital work in the twenty-first century; place manuscripts back into specific historical context; and re-appraise scholarly interpretation of significant periods of manuscript and print production in the later medieval and early modern periods. All of these essays call for a new assessment of the ways in which we read books and texts, making a major contribution to book history, and illustrating how detailed focus on individual cases can yield important new findings.

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

  Abstract: For scholars of the Middle Ages, the old
                  French chanson de gestehas traditionally served as the benchmark for one extreme of a continuum of representation, a genre expressing the distilled essence of the medieval masculine. This reading of the epic presumes a transparent equivalence of the masculine with the body and actions of the knight, constructing the “male” as a necessary element in an ideology of chivalric caste and power. Furthermore, this definition of the masculine is, in Simon Gaunt’s words, “monologic,” meaning that “in thechansons de gestemale characters are defined as individuals in relation to other<br>

  Book Title: Forgotten Dreams-Revisiting Romanticism in the Cinema of Werner Herzog<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Johnson Laurie Ruth<br>
  Abstract: Werner Herzog (b. 1942) is perhaps the most famous living German filmmaker, but his films have never been read in the context of German cultural history. And while there is a surfeit of film reviews, interviews, and scholarly articles on Herzog and his work, there are very few books devoted to his films, and none addressing his entire career to date. Until now. Forgotten Dreams offers not only an analytical study of Herzog's films but also a new reading of Romanticism's impact beyond the nineteenth century. It argues that his films re-envision and help us better understand a critical stream in Romanticism, and places the films in conversation with other filmmakers, authors, and philosophers in order to illuminate that critical stream. The result is a lively reconnection with Romantic themes and convictions that have been partly forgotten in the midst of Germany's postwar rejection of much of Romantic thought, yet are still operative in German culture today. The film analyses will interest scholars of film, German Studies, and Romanticism as well as a broader public interested in Herzog's films and contemporary German cultural debates. The book will also appeal to those interested in the ongoing renegotiation - by Western and other cultures - of relationships between reason and passion, civilization and wild nature, knowledge and belief.

  Book Title: Verse and Voice in Byrd's Song Collections of 1588 and 1589-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Smith Jeremy L.<br>
  Abstract: As he grappled with the challenges of composing for various instrumental and vocal ensembles, William Byrd (c. 1540-1623), England's premier Renaissance composer, devoted considerable attention to the poetry and prose of his native language, producing such treasured masterpieces as the hauntingly beautiful "Lulla lullaby"; the infectiously comedic "Though Amarillis dance in green"; and two extraordinarily dramatic Easter anthems. This book, the first full-length study specifically devoted to Byrd's English-texted music, provides a close reading of all of the works he published in the late 1580s, constituting nearly half of his total song output. It delves into the musical, political, literary, and, specifically, the sequential qualities of Byrd's 1588 and 1589 published collections as a whole, revealing, explaining, and interpreting an overall grand narrative, while remaining fully attentive to the particularities of each individual piece. Often deemed "unliterary" and generally considered political only in his approach to Latin texts, which were often of special interest to his fellow Catholics, Byrd was not only an inspired composer who had mastered the challenges of his nation's burgeoning verse, but also one who used his voice in song to foster a more inclusive polity in a time of religious strife.

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world. Genese Grill holds a PhD in Germanic Literatures and Languages from the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br>

  Book Title: Becoming John Updike-Critical Reception, 1958-2010<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Mazzeno Laurence W.<br>
  Abstract: When John Updike died in 2009, tributes from the literary establishment were immediate and fulsome. However, no one reading reviews of Updike's work in the late 1960s would have predicted that kind of praise for a man who was known then as a brilliant stylist who had nothing to say. What changed? Why? And what is likely to be his legacy? These are the questions that "Becoming John Updike" pursues by examining the journalistic and academic response to his writings. Several things about Updike's career make a reception study appropriate. First, he was prolific: he began publishing fiction and essays in 1956, published his first book in 1958, and from then on, brought out at least one new book each year. Second, his books were reviewed widely - usually in major American newspapers and magazines, and often in foreign ones as well. Third, Updike quickly became a darling of academics; the first book about his work was published in 1967, less than a decade after his own first book. More than three dozen books and hundreds of articles of academic criticism have been devoted to Updike. The present volume will appeal to the continuing interest in Updike's writing among academics and general readers alike. Laurence W. Mazzeno is President Emeritus of Alvernia University. Among other books, he has written volumes on Austen, Dickens, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold for Camden House's Literary Criticism in Perspective series.<br>

The perplexingly difficult nature of his work derives to a significant extent from his exploitation of the resources of the German language, so — even more than with most other philosophers — there is a clear advantage in reading him in the original rather than in translation.

  Book Title: Spanish Golden Age Poetry in Motion-The Dynamics of Creation and Conversation<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: The fourteen essays of this volume engage in distinct ways with the matter of motion in early modern Spanish poetics, without limiting the dialectic of stasis and movement to any single sphere or manifestation. Interrogation of the interdependence of tradition and innovation, poetry, power and politics, shifting signifiers, the intersection of topography and deviant temporalities, the movement between the secular and the sacred, tensions between centres and peripheries, issues of manuscript circulation and reception, poetic calls and echoes across continents and centuries, and between creative writing and reading subjects, all demonstrate that Helgerson's central notion of conspicuous movement is relevant beyond early sixteenth-century secular poetics, By opening it up we approximate a better understanding of poetry's flexible spatio-temporal co-ordinates in a period of extraordinary historical circumstances and conterminous radical cultural transformation. Los catorce ensayos de este volumen conectan de una manera perceptible con el tema del movimiento en la poesía española del siglo de oro, sin limitar la dialéctica de la estasis y movimiento a una sola esfera o manifestación única. Entre los multiples enfoques cabe destacar: el cuestionamiento de la interdependencia de la tradición e inovación, de la poesía, del poder y la política, de los significantes que se transforman, de los espacios que conectan y cruzan con los tiempos 'desviados'; análisis de las tensiones entre lo sagrado y lo secular, del conflicto centro-periferia y del complejo sistema de producción, circulación y recepción de los manuscritos; el diálogo con el eco poético a través de los siglos y de los continentes y la construcción creativa del sujeto escritor y/o lector. Al abrir la noción central de Helgerson del "movimiento conspicuo" más allá de la poesía nueva secular, este libro propone un entendimiento más completo de las coordinadas espacio-temporales de la poesía en un periodo de circunstan~<br>

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

  Abstract: An analysis of Schmidt’s dialectic of conscious and unconscious thought processes remains insufficient without a more thorough investigation of Schmidt’s understanding of subjectivity. An inquiry into what constitutes subjectivity seems even more necessary since Schmidt alludes to the androgynous character of our being. Schmidt’s stress on the unconscious as the prime determinant of our conscious mode of processing information unveils the central role the unconscious assumes in any reflection on subjectivity. Throughout the previous chapters, however, I emphasized that reading entails a process of decipherment, which in turn always leads to a process of construction and reconstruction.

Abstract: While Patten’s treatment of these issues is quite cogent, his work on Hegel falters at points. His argument relies at one stage on making sense of Hegelian “concrete universality,” but Patten seems impatient with the task of explaining it and neglects to grapple with Hegel’s logic. And because Patten places inadequate emphasis on the role of mutual recognition in Hegel’s social philosophy, he develops a reading of Hegel that, while appealing, is excessively individualistic, both in general and specifically in the case of Hegel.<br>

Abstract: This would be fertile ground for psychoanalysis. According to Freud, we are unconsciously convinced of our immortality, and beliefs about the afterlife are a compromise that allows us to accept death by denying its power of annihilation.
         17The structure of such compromise is dictated by the newborn’s state of absolute dependence. Like other religious representations, the afterlife is shaped by memories of childhood and the human species, as a way of enduring our original helplessness.18Had Freud interpreted book fourteen ofParadise,he would have related Dante’smammeto his notion of the mother as the child’s first object of love and protector against anxiety. Fond as he was of reading his theories into past authors, he would have praised the poet’s psychological penetration. But he would have undoubtedly stuck to his conviction that religious notions are only “illusions, fulfilments of the oldest, strongest and most urgent wishes of humanity.”19Frustrated on earth, we invent the afterlife as the spatial and temporal framework where our desires can be finally realized.<br>

Abstract: The second reason for adopting Kuhns notion is that it is intimately tied to the question of (in)commensurability. I found this idea appealing because I had been feeling for quite some time that, once we start digging deeper, we might find considerable disagreement among colleagues on what constitutes an appropriate way of studying language from an anthropological perspective. It was the hidden incommensurability that I found interesting and tried to make explicit. Pace Rumseys reading, I never suggested that we should be looking for one shared or
         Urparadigm or that differences could be easily reconciled. Perhaps my call for a dialogue at the end of the article was misplaced and potentially misleading. I should then qualify it by saying that the call was never meant as a call for an ecumenical outcome. I take dialogue to mean the possibility of understanding, which may imply the recognition (as well as the achievement) of either agreement or disagreement.<br>

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Although an influential figure within German social theory for decades, Luhmann has never been an especially popular figure in American circles, perhaps because his theory is in actuality what many sociologists have accused Parson’s of being: a theory reducing social actors to nothing more than epiphenomena of their social system. Hence, Luhmann’s book consists of his application of concepts such as system/environment, medium/form, first‐ and second‐order observation, self‐reference and external reference and above all the distinction between psychic systems (systems of consciousness) and social systems (systems of communication) to the realm of art, thereby conceptually transforming it into the “art system.” One of the ironies in Luhmann’s analysis is that his claim for the “autonomy of art” is seemingly refuted by his own, wholly social, assessment of it. Indeed, reading Luhmann’s book is a little like watching Frankenstein at work: his conceptual apparatus renders the ostensibly organic associations we might have of art as being instead mechanical and clinical. For all of Parsons’s own romance with systems theory and cybernetics, his central concern was always with the cultural product of those systems, which he referred to variously as “instrumental activism” and “institutionalized individualism,” that is, the way in which differentiation led to the production of a more complex and sophisticated individualism within the societal community. This constituted Parsons’s standard for the evolution of societies. Luhmann, meanwhile, consistently held that social systems operate “behind the backs” of actors, operating to reduce complexity for such actors, on the one hand, while furthering systems imperatives, on the other. This contrast between mentor and student becomes most obvious in their respective views of culture: while Parsons never fully unpacked the concept of culture in his own work, his emphasis on values and norms opened the door to what today is known as t~<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Several of the essays arein the theological senseapologetic. The first is a selfsituating, at times trenchant criticism of cognitive anthropology. The second is a historical account of psychoanalytic anthropology that is so parochial, so superficial that it hardly merits reading. Juillerat considers neither the critiques of psychoanalytic anthropology nor the research of ethnopsychoanalysts such as Paul Parin in Zurich, Waud Kracke in the United States, or the anthropologically oriented psychoanalysts in India, Japan, and South America. It would be a pity, however, if readers dismissed the book at this point, for the remaining essays are theoretically interesting, ethnographically rich, and at times conceptually disquieting. They include such topics as the nature of the symbol; the relationship between Freuds originary fantasies and LviStrausss basic kinship units (
      atomes de parent); the interaction between individual and collective representations; the conjunction of endopsychic projections of cosmologies and social reality; splitting and metamorphosis in the Yafar conception of death; parallels between the evolutionism in Yafar mythology and in BachofensMutterrecht; the stress on the paternal principle in Freud and the maternal in Jung; a rethinking of Maussian exchange theory that recognizes gifts that impose no obligation; an interpretation of a recent cargo cult that relates the land of plenty to the terror and longing for intrauterine return that is expressed in Yafar myth; and a reinterpretation of Naven as a psychodrama in which the uterine nephewthe eternal herois caught between agnatic law and incestuous ties with the mother. The last chapter consists of theoretical excerpts from JuilleratsLavnement du pre(1995), which, though meant to enrich the reading of Yafar ritual and myth, are difficult to evaluate out of context.<br>

Abstract: For instance, when I find myself in a medicalized situation (e.g., admittance to the hospital, removal of clothing, transfer to surgery, the reading of test results, submission to treatment), I become a medical object. Or more precisely, the hospital technology’s inevitable hold of power over me eliminates in me anything that will not reduce to a medical object. Under the gaze of medical personnel, and very soon under my own gaze, the treatment of my sick body will lead to its interpretation according to the parameters of physical bodies (size, quantification, measurements, etc.), with the result that my living flesh will disappear. Soon I will no longer feel the fact that I feel myself: anesthesia will not only deliver me from my pain, but also from my suffering self, and thus from my self’s self‐suffering. Next, every nonobjective function will disappear from this self (me), and my flesh, or that which is animated within me, will become an animal‐machine. This medical definition of my body as an object will also allow for the distinction of health from sickness in terms of norms. Thus is opened the fearful region in which man can make decisions about the normality, and thus the life and death, of other human beings—because these human beings have become simple human objects.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Abstract: But with regard to philosophy, we could give prominence to the process whereby the domain of human knowledge operates as an organically integrated, self‐sustaining whole. We could do this because we value the health of the processes themselves, by which I mean semantic innovation at the levels of word, narrative, and library, whereby the operations of reading and imagining mediate in the constitution of individual lives. Arguably, no other profession has this brief. It could also be said that we already practice as if these narrative theories are true.<br>

Author(s): Johar Schueller Malini<br>
Abstract: My analysis of the pervasiveness of the race‐gender analogy raises the obvious question about whether it is possible to theorize race and gender in any way other than analogically. Has analogy been so powerfully deployed that we simply cannot escape it when we think of race and gender? To the extent that feminist theory—white or otherwise—refuses specificity, there is always a danger of analogizing. Take, for instance, Sandoval’s attempt to articulate an oppositional politics in
         Methodology of the Oppressed(2000). Although Sandoval critiques Haraway’s appropriation of the methodologies of women of color into examples of cyborg feminism (Sandoval2000, 71), her book remains indebted to Haraway’s construction of the cyborg as a generalized locus of difference and contradiction. Perhaps that is why the predominant mode of analysis inMethodology of the Oppressedis analogizing different forms of dissident consciousness, such as Roland Barthes’s punctum (a meaning that cannot be named, because it is not part of a collective code; Barthes1981, 27), Anzaldúa’smestizaje(mixture, hybrid; Anzaldúa1987), and Haraway’s cyborg feminism. While it might well be important to demonstrate the undeniable structural similarities among these concepts, the very methodology of generalization and analogy might blind us to problems apparent only through localized readings. For instance, to bypass the reading of Anzaldúa’smestizajein the context of Mexico, where it was the official policy of amalgamation and adopted in order to disempower black races, is to miss the crucial contradiction here between progressive feminism and hegemonic racial hierarchies.15<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: Yet while a dialectic of theology of religions and comparative theology can thus provide the most basic modus operandi of solidary interreligious engagement for Christians, the formulation given it so far has been based on a Gadamerian reading of Hegel’s dialectically formulated recognitive process in terms of “fusion of horizons” that is also informed by a Levinasian critique of Hegel in the name of the self’s asymmetrical relation to the infinity of the other’s voice.
         41When left as it is, however, such a reading does not do full justice to the sociopolitically inscribed nature of the recognitive process, insofar as each religious horizon of recognition and evaluation refers to an emergent religious identity that is a site of negotiation and contestation for various social, cultural, and religious identities. Thus, the question here put to the idea of “fusion of horizons” is: which horizons? Similarly, the challenge presented to the notion of the rupture of one’s totalizing horizon by the always emergent, negotiated, and contested voice of a religious other is: which other? The language of “horizon” or “other” must first be given back its sociopolitically concrete and internally heterogeneous meaning if the unifying narrative of identity sought by means of politically intentional hybridization is not to turn out as an instrument of domination suppressing the multiplicity of heterogeneous voices—social, cultural, and religious identities—within each site of religious identity that clamors for recognition.<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Maggi Armando<br>
Abstract: The first and most influential treatise on the shroud is
      Esplicatione del lenzuolo ove fu involto il Signore(Interpretation of the sheet in which the Lord was enshrouded) by Alfonso Paleotto, Archbishop of Bologna. Paleotto’s seminal text came out in 1598, twenty years after the transfer of the shroud from Chambéry to Turin, the new capital of the state of Savoy. Paleotto’s book is at once a scientific description of the figure imprinted on the cloth and a meditative appropriation of the two images. The section “The Beauty and Measures of the Lord’s Body” (chap. 3) offers a detailed commentary on the two images reproduced at the beginning of his book (fig. 1). Paleotto adds a biblical quotation, “torcular calcavi solus” (I have trodden the wine press alone [Is. 63:3]), as if Christ himself commented on the image of his corpse. According to Paleotto, the Word wished to grant us a remembrance of his handsome face, which inThe Song of Songsthe bride had already contemplated in its powerful splendor.9If, as session 25 of the Council of Trent confirms, “ordinary” images “created by human art” can be used “to excite our celestial love,” how could we possibly refrain from contemplating the self‐portrait the Word granted us?10Paleotto’s devotional reading of the shroud could be read as a form ofaffetto(affective response), a key term of Italian seventeenth‐century literature. Based on Ignatius’sExercises,affettoindicates a literary text (prose or poetry) that aims at triggering a devotional response in the reader’s mind, a sort of “conversion of the heart,” as the Dominican Ignazio del Nente stresses in his important religious works.11In “The First Exercise,” Ignatius stresses that, if a meditation is “about something that can be gazed upon,” the imagination must first sketch a “physical space.”12In Paleotto’s text, the shroud is the space of the meditation on Christ’s passion. After the intellect has studied this inner space in greater detail, the will leads us “to d~<br>

Abstract: Meanwhile, as one of us listened to these assaults on Conrad and Cather, the other chose to visit the session on “Feminist Perspectives on the Frankfurt School,” which drew a standing‐room‐only crowd and turned out to offer a little of everything—except, of course, literature. No sooner had we seated ourselves and unpacked the trusty tape recorder than we heard the familiar whine of the dentist’s drill—no, sorry, our mistake: it was only the sound of the first speaker, who had come to “clarify the function of femininity in Frankfurt School thought, with an emphasis on re‐reading the work of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the context of gender.” Ah, yes, we knew it well: the “critique of patriarchy and logocentricsm,” old friends such as the feminist icons Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, not to mention Judith Butler, the young philosopher of queer theory who our rough tabulation identified as the second most frequently referred to person at the convention. The most frequently cited figure was undoubtedly Walter Benjamin, the hapless Marxist critic and protege of Adorno who committed suicide while fleeing from the Nazis in 1940.<br>

Abstract: President George W. Bush officially proclaimed the next day, September 14, to be the “National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims of the Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001.” In Mrs. Barrett’s classroom, Bush’s proclamation meant the day would be devoted to Christian prayer. She began the class by reading three verses from the Bible aloud, one about trusting God,
            12one about giving thanks to God,13and the third about mourning.14The class session would be orchestrated around these three categories, which she listed on the board: “thanks/ rejoicing,” “mourning,” and things to “pray for.” The students first wrote in their answers and then took turns reading what they had posted, prayers that included thanks “that they didn’t bomb our town,” thanks “for 5 police officers” who had been found in the rubble of the World Trade Towers, thanks that “the Pennsylvania plane didn’t hit.” Mrs. Barrett summarized the prayers, smoothly transitioning to the next column by saying that despite all they were thankful for, “We still mourn with those who are experiencing terrible sadness today and a terrible sense of loss. Many people who don’t know you are feeling hopeless and helpless and are feeling angry. They are in great pain, Lord. We mourn with those who mourn.”<br>

Abstract: While Sofia abounds with analogous examples, Unfried chose to make a different case for Bulgaria. He focused on the fate of Dimitrov's mummy, which had been kept in the mausoleum since his death in 1949. On July 18, 1990, Dimitrov's family decided to remove the mummy for cremation and burial in the family grave in the Orlandovtsi Cemetery. Here is Unfried's reading of the events: “Under the pressure of permanent profanity, one night Dimitrov's mummy was removed, burnt [the verb used in German is
         verbrannt,notkremiertoreingeäschert] and buried in the family grave. The burning of a mummy is the worst thing that can happen to it in the belief of mummifying death rituals, because it means the second, final death. In popular belief the mummy is also linked with the fear of ghouls. In Sofia, however, there was an additional consideration in the air: the purification of a corrupt relic in the dazzling flames.”53<br>

Abstract: This is a thoughtful, wide‐ranging, and ambitious study by an author well established as an insightful cultural historian. Drawing on close and sensitive readings of a number of nineteenth‐ and twentieth‐century novels of homicide and detection, Stephen Kern charts a paradigmatic shift in the nature of fictional causality. Crime novels were chosen for the insight they might offer the historian into “new ways of rendering the causes and motives for human action,” and Kern traces a movement away from the “clear and strongly deterministic causal factors” (p. 4) favored by nineteenth‐century authors in the explanation of transgression toward greater complication and confusion in modernist representations of causal connection. He argues that a chronological reading of murder novels across his chosen period reveals a “multifaceted shift” in five interrelated ways—“namely, that causal understanding moved in the direction of increasing specificity [as a consequence of developments in forensic science, for example], multiplicity, increasing complexity, probability and uncertainty” (p. 6). In the eight chapters that follow, Kern marshals an enormous amount of evidence to trace these shifts in our understandings of the factors that may influence violent action—our ancestral inheritance, our childhood, the ways in which language or education construct our sense of the real or the actual, our sexuality, our emotions, our intellect, our interaction with society in a wider sense, and our ideological commitments. Kern’s range of reference is impressive, and he moves comfortably from the scientific to the literary, the prosaic to the poetic. He is well acquainted with contemporary developments in the ideas of chance, probability, and determinism, and, in particular, he writes knowledgeably of the consequences for fiction of the emergence of quantum theory in the first half of the twentieth century.<br>

Abstract: A similar poetic reading of the Genesis 2–3 story of Adam and Eve helps us relate this command for original creativity to original sin. When read as an eternal pattern for the human moral order, this story has of course been used for millennia to uphold deep structures of gender oppression. But read poetically, the sexual difference instead mythologizes human moral tension in its profound creative ambiguity. Adam and Eve’s fall is precisely into “shame” at their generative difference. In hiding their “reproductive” capabilities from one another, humankind in the process hides (in the bushes) from its own very Creator. Human relations lose their dynamic tensionality and crouch in silent stasis.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: This posited, Popkin furnishes a wealth of information on the origins of the historian’s autobiography (Hume, Gibbon, Vico), its nineteenth‐century expressions (Dilthey, Henry Adams), and especially its sociological and literary characteristics during the second half of the twentieth century. Most authors have been white males, from middle‐class backgrounds, nearing the end of distinguished careers. Still, women, minorities (especially Jews), historians of working‐class origin, and middle‐aged authors have made inroads since the 1980s. This produces significant differences: women, for instance, are less likely than men to link their vocation to their teenage interest in history or to depict a nurturing community of scholars. Popkin minimizes, however, the impact of sociology. Commonalities predominate in his analysis. Most historian‐autobiographers, for one, frame their life stories as bildungsroman narratives, in which the author’s personality takes shape through the choice of a vocation. Like Friedrich Meinecke, they tell tales of self‐discovery, free will, and success. Their chronological accounts usually begin with warm childhoods in families that encouraged reading, education, and a thoughtful path toward a meaningful career. They then describe the pivotal apprenticeship and university years, the key mentors, and the decision‐making process through which the authors exercised their will and defined themselves. Theirs is invariably a process of choice rather than conflict or sudden illumination, even if world events captured the imaginations of many budding historians.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, Derrida does not seem to have been familiar with the basic tenets of Patočka’s later phenomenology, in particular his reinterpretation of the Husserlian conception of the lifeworld. According to Patočka, the natural world is constituted by three movements that are fundamental for understanding his reference to the exceptional (the orgiastic, demonic, or sacred), the inauthenticity of everydayness, and, above all, the motif of the care of the soul. Nonetheless, Derrida’s reading of the essay in question is a very fine account of Patočka’s thought.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against the first characterization of Advaita teaching, the recognition of the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the
         anayatvamsutra (II.1.14)—that is, as internally constituted by the realist cosmological discourse that it subverts—suggests that the interpretation of theBhāṣya’steaching in terms of the illusionist doctrine ofmāyāvādais reductionistic. Moreover, well‐intentioned attempts to dissociate Śaṅkara frommāyāvādathat presume a monological conception of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse, attempts such as that of Srinivasa Rao mentioned above, end up effectively conceding the claim they set out to deny; their affirmation of the reality of the world typically appeals to a denial of substantial change, a claim that implicitly relegates changing, finite existences to the realm of the unreal.114As for the static and abstract conception of brahman, this notion can be seen as the result of the later tradition’s attempt to impose a rigid, categorical distinction between the concepts ofīśvaraand the highest (paraṃ) brahman. This effort to systematize Śaṅkara’s somewhat inconsistent, fluid, and intuitive use of the termīśvarawith respect to the various expressions for brahman effectively pulls apart the dialectical interplay between the personalistic and impersonalistic aspects of brahman in theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣya. What Hacker characterizes as an “illogical” combination of intuitive theism and intellectual monism can perhaps be better understood as an instance of what Michael Sells, in a discussion of apophatic language in the West, calls “a discourse of double propositions.”115A reading of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyathat appreciates the creative interplay among this text’s multiple voices preserves the vitality and intensity of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse on brahman, a liveliness of expression that we may assume more accurately reflects Śaṅkara’s religious vision.<br>

Abstract: “I chose this story above all others because it’s a story I’m struggling to end. … That’s why I write fiction—so that I can keep telling the story. … Always a new beginning, a different end,” Winterson writes toward the close of her narrative (
         2005, 137). Linking the desire for retelling with the inability to formulate a conclusion and the necessity for an open ending, Winterson has Atlas walk away, yet presents this “very particular end not found elsewhere” (xiv) as but one possibility among several, the choice of which is ultimately left to the individual reader’s personal preference: “no one knows its composition,” Winterson observes. “Dark matter could be conventional matter, … or it could even be black holes. Or it could be Atlas holding up the universe. But I think it is Atlas and Laïka walking away” (2005, 151).Weight’s multiperspectival ending underscores its status as inaugural retelling of myth for a twenty‐first century that can only assimilate more pasts into its ever broadening present. In this sense, the Myths seems typical for the contemporary take on re‐vision. Whereas the names of the authors hold the promise of retellings with a critical edge—Achebe having given usThings Fall Apartas a reply to and a thorough undermining of Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darkness(see Moyers1989; Achebe1990), and neither Atwood nor Winterson is a stranger to rewriting as cultural critique—Winterson’s phrase and its appropriation by the series’ editor make us suspect differently. “We want to tell the story again,” as the series’ editor Jamie Byng puts it on Canongate’s Web site, speaks of the storyteller’s desire for and delight in language; of the pleasure of telling stories, of keeping the stories alive by retelling them. Inevitably also meaning “we want tosellthe story again,” retelling becomes a retailing strategy, promising ever new and improved reading experiences that are as ephemeral as any other consumer experience. Speaking neither of learning from the p~<br>

Abstract: Before turning to the second version of the pragmatic theory of truth, it is important to highlight Peirce’s notion of truth as consensus, as is noted by Van der Veer Martens [
         26]. It is with this theory that all notions of absolutism in propositional truth vanish. Propositions are true because the majority of people within a given society accept them to be true. The collection of all such propositions constitutes the social theory of reality [69, vol. 8, p. 12]. Many librarians reading this will undoubtedly think about the various monographs and articles on social epistemology they read in library science school. Peirce was the grandfather of social epistemology. For Peirce, as in contemporary writing on social epistemology, any version of ontological absolutism must be dispensed with. Knowledge about humanity and the world are in continual revision. Indeed, as stated above, the very growth of knowledge demands this revision. It is at this point concerning the growth of knowledge that the second version of the pragmatic theory of truth emerges.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: This book will be read from cover to cover by very few people. It can be considered required reading for even fewer. Scholars interested in Continental philosophy and postmodern theology will appreciate Reynolds’s treatment of key themes and thinkers, although few of his arguments are novel. The strengths of the book are chiefly expository and topical. Reynolds does a good job of “teaching” his favorite thinkers to the uninitiated. His explanation of Richard Rorty’s concept of irony, for example, is quite useful. Furthermore, the issues that drive Reynolds’s argument (presumably, the possibility of peaceful coexistence in a world of profound difference) have genuine urgency.<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: In conjuring up the conceptual field of such effects, we might turn to set theory and picture a Venn diagram by which narratography is defined as exactly the zone of overlap between narratology and stylistics. Narratography would be shaded in there by the very shadings and incremental gradations of prose in the thick and thin of its own action as linguistic incident. Here emerges, in sum, the heuristic value of a so-called
         Story Left Behindin staging by exaggeration the everyday wake of narrativity in verbal process. Any narrative sentence may have its dramatic prehistory. It need not necessarily be distended or suddenly truncated, not by definition brutal or suppressed or moving or any one thing in particular, and not necessarily longer than the plotted tension of the preceding paragraph or even sentence. But narrative prehistory is manifest as a forward pressure nonetheless. That's why this essay's approach is in fact “narratival” rather than strictly stylistic (whatever that might mean)—and often dialectical as such. And why its instinct for intensive reading comes into sync with the impetus of plotted structure rather than just local representation. And why, further, even in imagining an entire shadow plot, the inflated exception developed in the fictional phase of this essay can still prove the rule of the minuscule. Whole lives, of course, don't usually lie battered, absented, and returned by deformation under the tread of suchfrictionin prose. Broad swaths of plot aside, it is rather in the immediate pace of reading that some aspect or facet of an advancing story is often bent noticeably out of shape.

Abstract: À la limite, even my own first‐person, self‐conscious, and affective response to the neuroactivity provoked in my brain by a given set of circumstances is a neuronal phenomenon; as such, it may be propositionally mapped on the basis of brain imaging—but not better by me than by any neuroscientist reading my brain scans. Neuroscience makes us dispassionate spectators of a conative performance that we not only care passionately about, but are the protagonists of. Regardless of how precisely my and my neighbor’s brain scans image the neuroactivity corresponding to our decision making, and regardless as well of how unaware both of us are of the distinctive patterns in our brain’s degeneracy, it remains that my and my neighbor’s respective participation in the spectacles of these neuroactivities differ in kind. I conceive of myself (and narrate myself) as the protagonist of my own intentions and the spectator of my neighbor’s. The degree of personal freedom whereby I cope with the constraining necessities imposed on my intentions by external circumstances is the negative carbon copy of the degree of necessity whereby I cope with my neighbor’s personal freedom in dealing with his or her own constraints. I consider myself accountable for my actions and emotions in inverse proportion to the constraints imposed on my intentions; I consider myself accountable for my neighbor’s actions and emotions in direct proportion to my ability to affect the constraints imposed on his or her intentions. And I consider my conscious reaction to the stimuli received from my neighbor’s and my external circumstances as efficacious in “steering [my] nervous system,” to adopt William James’s terminology inPrinciples of Psychology, rather than a mere reflection of the causal effects exercised by my brain’s neuronal firings on my actions and decisions.8<br>

Abstract: Understanding Augustine’s ethics of homicide properly, then, means placing it within a wider framework of moral psychology and social roles, focusing on desire, the order of our attachments, and the temptations that such attachments pose in private and public life. We get nowhere reading Augustine’s theological ethics until we understand that, for him, the good is prior to the right. In his ethics of killing, it is crucial to grasp how homicide raises questions about one’s internal psychic harmony, the ordering of one’s loves. Homicide might derive from a lack of harmony and peace from within. Peace within the soul is the sine qua non of peaceful relationships, relationships that are rightly ordered according to natural purposes and patterns.

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Abstract: Readers without solid background knowledge of French film and colonial history may have some difficulty navigating through Eades's tightly packed, allusive prose, especially since no index of any kind is provided. This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

Abstract: Deleuze's project may appear to be based on taste (the canon of
         Cahiers du cinéma, most reviewers agree) and on the reading of cinematic figures, but, in fact, his cinema books lay out a conceptual network where films function as nodes that connect lines of thought. As he would famously proclaim, these lines are not human thoughts traversing films but the thinking of the cinema machine itself. As for cultural studies, Deleuze fought every effort to territorialize social energy, even into something as progressive as emergent cultures. His anarchist politics may have triggered a phrase like “the people are missing,”45but this concept is less a description of the Third World through Third Cinema than a concept marking the location of a vortex around which subcultural and supracultural energy whirls out of human control.<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: By describing Lévinas's work in terms that insist on the capacity of this thought to dismantle subjectivity, Blanchot reads Lévinas in such a way that Lévinas's concerns come to appear very close to Blanchot's own. As most readers of Lévinas would have to admit, there is something of a disharmony between this reading and most straightforward interpretations of Lévinas's texts. Even Derrida, who tends to read texts against the grain, doubts the claims of similarity that Blanchot's reading seems to assert, arguing that between Lévinas's thought and Blanchot's affinities only arise in relation to the critical and negative moments in Lévinas's texts.
         36Blanchot's interpretation is thus a doubling that unworks Lévinas's thought and pushes it to its extremes.<br>

Abstract: Surely one major pertinent transformation has involved a recalibration of the analytic practices of, on the one hand, literary scholars interested in science and, on the other, select cohorts of science studies experts. In each case, such recalibration involved new and intensive attention to the practices of “scientists” themselves.
         4From the early 1980s on, a new generation of scholars increasingly turned their attention to performative dimensions of the different kinds of work avidly pursued by scientific practitioners in the making of knowledge about nature. The common thread that bound together emerging work in the reconfigured field of literature and science was analytic attention to the performative effects and affordances of literary and linguistic dimensions of scientific practice and communication.5For science studies more generally, including the history of science, attention turned in parallel fashion to the material practices associated with different sciences and thus to the performative effects and affordances of laboratory and experimental protocols; collecting, observing, recording, and categorizing devices and procedures; the material regimes constituting such analytic practices, from mathematical and statistical analysis to myriad techniques for “reading” particular kinds of data critical to specific scientific subspecialties; and, finally, the networks of exchange that foster the circulation of the objects, material practices, and epistemic things that contribute to the making of scientific knowledge.6<br>

Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: Here, we come a bit closer to the seductive nature of Augustinian rhetoric. Deprived of clock time, the “since the day I learnt of you” turns into the magic of memory and oblivion. A-causally and counterintuitively it is a world turned upside down. Memory and time (
      ex quo) function asle marteau sans maître, the “hammer of existence,”esse solum, that is ordered as well as given and is incapable of not being confessed and lived, the song that cannot be silenced and cannot disappear from memory and expectation. Oblivion is the silent performance of precisely that: the loss of sound, as a means of survival—in sinful forgetfulness—vis-à-vis that “beauty so old and so new” contained in the ultimate expression of time as present: the temporality of thesero te amavi. But what exactly is being expressed in thesero te amavi? Moreover, if this simultaneity of memory and oblivion is expressed, that is still not the same as the divine voice sounding on its own account. Here, we touch upon the ultimate enigma ofConfessions: the hammer of existence, “Da quod iube, iube quod vis”/“Grant what you command and command what you will.”
            Who is able to withstand the lure—and violence—of that song that, as far as sonority is concerned, cannot be distinguished from the “beauty so old and so new”? One is reminded of Kafka here—the hammer of existence—and his story of the Sirens' song:22
         
            It would be little respectful to Kafka and Augustine to make one-to-one comparisons between this passage and the AugustinianProof that inadequate, even childish measures may come to the rescue.
            To protect himself from the Sirens, Ulysses put wax in his ears and had himself chained to the mast of his ship. Of course, all travelers before him could have done the same, except those whom the Sirens had already allured from afar, but it was known to all the world that such things were of no help whatever. The song of the Sirens could penetrate everything, and th~<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: This approach, however, is not altogether new. We must be careful not to presume—as Jasper does—“the impossibility of any systematic theology in a time of the unsystematic and aphoristic” (5). Fragment and system are not mutually exclusive. Aphorism acknowledges the apophatic, and a complex Neoplatonic system informs the negative theology that resonates with many of the essays in this volume. Here, it is encouraging that Jasper, Hass, and Kelly Van Andel all invoke Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Van Andel is correct that Coleridge’s theories of symbol and imagination, as well as his practice as a poet, challenge what often passes for literature and theology by celebrating “open ambiguity rather than closed certitude” (212). Coleridge fails to complete his system—his impossible quest for unity—but he nonetheless articulates (through symbol) a systematic method. To understand this, we must recognize the relation of Coleridge’s symbol to traditional allegory and negative theology via a more careful reading of
      The Statesman’s Manual(London, 1816) that considers (contra Van Andel’s overreliance on Thomas McFarland) the hermeneutic and biblical context of the symbol/allegory distinction in Coleridge’s lay sermon. This is a minor but important adjustment that reinforces the larger claim that the tensional practice of literature and theology can revitalize old truths, for “the renewal of traditions is often accomplished through discomforting processes of radical critique” (2).<br>

Abstract: This straight-forward reading of the passage has been obscured by interpreters, ancient and modern, who interpret מחניהם as referring to “their camps” (plural) and thus assert the existence of a requirement to maintain purity in all cities. For a coherent understanding of the syntax and content of this passage, it is necessary to understand the form as singular (“their camp”). Note the form מחניך alongside מחנך in Deut. 23:15, both meaning “your camp” (singular). Among the moderns, the fact that מחניהם in our verse is singular has been noted by J. Licht (
         A Commentary on the Book of Numbers, vol. 1 [Jerusalem, 1985], 59–60 [Heb.]), and Levine (Numbers 1–20, 182, 186), and it is assumed by the JPS translation. I plan on elaborating on these points in a study in progress, “The Wilderness Camp Paradigm in the Holiness Source and the Temple Scroll: From Purity Laws to Cult Politics.”<br>

Abstract: Amélie Rorty, the one philosopher among the commentators, engages with the systematic elements of my argument: the problems of considering morality as a cultural system and of whether a systematic understanding of evil as a category is possible. She agrees that morality is not properly a system but a “polymorphous pluralism” in practice and observes that the multiple concerns of Anglo-American moral theory exhibit distinctive and even incommensurable logics and rationales. Rorty, like Parkin, accepts that attention to the dark side can illuminate what is at stake in morality but is surprised at my focus on evil as the “primary default contrast.” As with Crapanzano’s reading of my argument as dualist, I must rejoin that I take evil to be not so much a default contrast as an existential possibility that subtends morality and makes it necessary. However, the core of Rorty’s commentary makes it clear that the category of evil exhibits multiple concerns that are just as incommensurable and unsystematic as those of morality in general. In a tour de force paragraph that is both analytic and historical, she parses 11 components of evil broadly conceived (I only wonder if there are others, including violence and wickedness) and weaves them into a coherent narrative of incommensurability (I only wonder if this is lack of a system or complexity of a system). This is particularly valuable because it makes me realize the extent to which my argument is inflected toward one of those components, namely, malevolence. Finally, I reiterate that philosophers have not been as reticent as anthropologists to engage evil (see my footnote listing several recent philosophical works on the topic, not least among which is a book by Rorty herself). I resist attributing this to philosophers’ ethnocentrism. As Rorty observes (and Crapanzano as well), it has something to do with the morality of anthropology as a social practice.<br>

Abstract: The treatment of the ancient and modern examples is also somewhat too neat and overly selective. For example, it is definitely appropriate to analyze the relationship between theory and practice in rabbinic Judaism on the basis of Hadot’s analysis of ancient philosophy. But Fisher should have reflected on the interplay of theory and praxis in rabbinic Judaism in light of the Aristotelian tradition, which is utterly and consistently ignored in this book. Similarly, Fisher admits that his analysis of
      Mekhihta of Rabbi Yishmaelis indebted to Max Kadushin’s insightful presentation of rabbinic Judaism as “organismic” system of value concepts (105), but Fisher does not analyze the philosophical basis of Kadushin’s reading, as does Peter Ochs, whose book is cited in the notes but whose analysis is not engaged. The treatment of Rosenzweig also exhibits a penchant for selectivity. To show how his model of Jewish theological practice applies to contemporary debates about Rosenzweig and therefore to contemporary Jewish theology, Fisher singles out two interpreters: Leora Batnitzky (whose interpretation he finds “idiosyncratic” [163]) and Peter Gordon (who is accused of “grossly distor[ting] Rosenzweig’s point” [166]). While Fisher’s own interpretation of Rosenzweig is most suggestive, whether Jewish theological practice is a viable model cannot be decided by showing the limitations of two interpretations of Rosenzweig to the exclusion of all others.<br>

Abstract: In Varro, things are much more complicated. I have always read the
         Antiquitates rerum divinarumas relating to Roman religion, but closer reading shows this interpretation to be partial at best. Augustine discusses the sequence of the treatment of human and divine affairs in theAntiquitates:
               
            Rerum quippe humanarum libros, non quantum ad orbem terrarum, sed quantum ad solam Romam pertinet, scripsit, quos
            tamenrerum divinarum libris se dixit scribendi ordine merito praetulisse.
                     
               53
                  
               The opposition or paradox implied by Augustine’s[[Varro] wrote the books on human things, which do not concern the whole world, but just Rome, which he nevertheless, as he said, positioned in the order of writing fully justified before the books on divine things.]
            tamenworks only if a larger than urban, probably a universal orientation of the latter part of the oeuvre is to be assumed. To talk of the “universal” in regard to antiquity always needs an additional note. The standards of universality were set by Greek thinking, based on the experience of theoikoumeneof the Mediterranean world, Greek colonization, international trade, and the Hellenistic empires. Beyond that, thebarbaroiremained, peoples only occasionally acknowledged to have human culture.<br>

Abstract: The meaning of
         catharsisin Aristotle’sPoeticsis heavily debated, with most interpretations clustering around three key translations: purgation, purification, and clarification. In his 1599 treatise on tragicomedy, Giambattista Guarini likened catharsis to the medical procedure of purging, as neither seeks eradication of the target element but instead restoration of balance (The Compendium of Tragicomic Poetry (1599), inLiterary Criticism: Plato to Dryden, ed. Allan H. Gilbert [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1962], 517–20; see also O. B. Hardison Jr., “Three Types of Renaissance Catharsis,” inPoetics and Praxis, Understanding and Imagination: The Collected Essays of O. B. Hardison, Jr.[Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997], 78–94). Martha C. Nussbaum has characterized catharsis as a “clearing up” or “cleaning up” of emotions (“Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity,” inEssays on Aristotle’sPoetics, ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992], 280), and Gerald F. Else has argued that catharsis is a purification of the act of the character rather than a purgation of the emotions of the audience (Aristotle’s Poetics: The Argument[Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963], 230–31, 422–40). John P. Anton, critiquing Nietzsche’s reading of Aristotle’sPoetics, argues that Nietzsche was incorrect in construing catharsis as a purge of emotions, also claiming that it is a clarification of events (“Nietzsche’s Critique of Aristotle’s Theory of Tragic Emotions,” inTragedy and Philosophy, ed. N. Georgopoulos [New York: St. Martin’s, 1993], 19–38). In light of this ongoing debate about the meaning of a single Greek word, several critics have suggested other language and models through which to examine the phenomenon of audience response to tragedy—a useful critical strategy for discussing how modern audiences might conceptualize their own reaction to what they see on stage.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: The value of Popkin's approach becomes clear in his chapter on two historians whose autobiographies have been included in the literary canon for many years: Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams. By reading them as historians, Popkin offers new insights to an already great body of literature on these authors, for instance by showing that both Gibbon and Adams believed that their personal experiences helped them in understanding the past. Not all 327 autobiographers listed in the bibliography are discussed in depth, and in chapters on vocation and career their works serve to sketch an impression of the historical profession in the twentieth century. Bookish children from middle‐class backgrounds, as most historians have been, often picked up their vocation from parents or teachers. They were also often inspired by children's books like those by Jules Verne and Karl May, which is interesting, because despite these literary models they chose to write nonfiction. For Popkin this is a telling detail, as he concludes that historians are obviously motivated by a wish to tell stories. With few exceptions historians are reluctant to write about their careers. Most are silent about their academic successes, failures, and frustrations, and few pages are spent on the daily life of teaching courses and doing administrative work. On the contrary, most authors want to show that they had another life besides their profession. Therefore they often describe their own lives against the background of great events. Since Jean‐Jacques Rousseau's
      Confessions, autobiography has been seen as a genre that should focus on the innermost experience and not world events, but many historians simply could not cast off their professional background. Often only those historians who were involved in politics became aware of how little an individual could accomplish, or lost faith in the ideas they once had believed. Holocaust memoirs are discussed in a separate chapter, in which Popkin concludes that t~<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: The final chapter, which considers the
      Lex Mercatoria(1622) of the merchant Gerrard de Malynes, can stand for what is most distinctive about Anderson’s book. Like all that precedes it, it is the product of equal parts intense close reading and deep research. (The endnotes, fully a third again of the book’s length and set in smaller type, are a rich mine both of reference and reflection.) She unfolds Malynes’s body-soul-and-spirit allegory of “the three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke” (177) — commodities, money, and exchange — in order to show how he argues for the overriding economic importance of monetary policy. Malynes has his critics, both on account of his metaphors (which were disparaged by contemporaries such as Thomas Mun) and his theory (Mun again, and most modern economists). What Anderson is ultimately concerned to show, however, is how, for all of the potential intricacy of the relations between body and exchange, Malynes’s conceit is sterile, never transforming or vitalizing what I. A. Richards would call its economic tenor. His book had little power to change the way his contemporaries talked about money. Critics mostly celebrate the discovery of metaphorical overplus: here is a valuable lesson in how metaphor might fail.<br>

Abstract: Although the clarity with which Wu writes makes this book accessible to nonspecialists, he evidently assumes the reader is familiar with China and the subject of tombs. For example, no maps are included, despite frequent mentions made of specific provinces and cities. Additionally, no matter how obscure or technical the terms, he provides Chinese characters in only one instance (128). The reliance on pinyin romanization may make it somewhat frustrating for specialists encountering these terms for the first time to understand them or even to look them up in a dictionary. Oddly, several line drawings and diagrams only employ Chinese characters; it would have been helpful for Wu to translate these. However, these minor shortcomings do not overshadow the overall importance of this book. On account of its remarkably original theoretical approach,
   The Art of the Yellow Springsis essential reading material for anyone interested in a new interpretation of Chinese tombs.<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Abstract: In the text-based disciplines, psychoanalysis and Marxism have had a major influence on how we read, and this has been expressed most consistently in the practice of symptomatic reading, a mode of interpretation that assumes that a text's truest meaning lies in what it does not say, describes textual surfaces as superfluous, and seeks to unmask hidden meanings. For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.<br>

Abstract: On enigma as a rhetorical figure: a brief history in the rhetoricians, encyclopedists, and patristic commentators from Aristotle to Dante's time, with a rhetorical analysis of the figure. Special attention is given to Augustine in the

Some implications of Augustine's linking of the figurative and the figural (typological, historical) are considered, with a re-examination of Auerbach's "Figura" on this question. The importance for our own reading of rhetoric in relation to history and poetry is stressed.<br>

Abstract: There are two ways of reading Goffman--as a theorist of trust and ritual accommodation, that is, as a theorist of the interaction order, or as a theorist of deception. I suggest a way of making these two readings compatible, by arguing that Goffman was interested in what I call the “production of credibility.” Credibility is the quality of being believable, and this quality is integral to both trust and deception. Viewed in this way, Goffman explored the ways in which people make their actions convincing to other people. Although Goffman's analysis of the interaction order did not need a theory of the self, his work actually contains two quite different theories of the self: one linked to role analysis, one to his analysis of mental illness. I argue for the latter at the expense of the former. I conclude that Goffman both initiated substantive work about the interaction order and contributed to a synthesis of a theory of the interaction order and a theory of the self.<br>

Journal Title: Curriculum Inquiry<br>
Article Title: Education as Text: The Varieties of Educational Hiddenness<br>
Publisher: John Wiley & Sons<br>
Issue: i250429<br>
Date: 12 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Generic Analysis of a Classic of the Social Gospel: An Essay-Review of Walter Rauschenbusch<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Article Title: Generic Studies: Their Renewed Importance in Religious and Literary Interpretation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263709<br>

Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

thing signified and stipulated that what is signified cannot be resolved into experiential components
and configurations. Verstehen is not just simply the "resubjectifying of objectivations in a 'back-
ward' movement from the objective expression to the immanent subjective experiences of the
expresser, but also a 'forward movement' from the sign to its intentional object" (Wilhelm Dilthey:

Abstract: Rather than viewing Freud as a presumptuous Viennese physician who late in life attempted to "apply" some of his provocative psychological speculations to various social phenomena, this essay argues that from first to last, Freud was a social theorist. Indeed, what drew Freud to the study of biology and medicine was precisely the hope of addressing scientifically the most fundamental cultural problems: the nature of man and his culture; the origins of religion, morality, and tradition and the nature of their extraordinary power; the sources of social order and disorder; the direction of contemporary cultural development; and, finally, the problem of how to live in a disenchanted and psychologically impoverished world. Reading Freud in this manner moves his "cultural" texts from the periphery to the center of his work and makes possible an appreciation of the more complex, coherent, and illuminating social theory that lies at its heart.<br>

Article Title: Speech Acts and Written Texts: A Reading of a Seventeenth-Century Ottoman Historiographic Episode<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303098<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Gabriel<br>
Abstract: The article draws on a doctoral dissertation which suggests a different approach to Ottoman historical texts. Its chief argument is that contrary to current scholarly assumptions, the seventeenth-century Tarih-i Al-i Osman works are not unstructured mines of information useful only for the reconstruction of extrinsic referents. Informed by the so-called linguistic or literary turn in some quarters of historical scholarship, the dissertation approaches the historical texts as a historiographic corpus that constitutes a narrative discourse containing a variety of interpretations, judgments, and meanings conveyed by various forms of language. The article itself is a reading of a historiographic story, the Haile-i Osmaniye (Ottoman tragedy), in the light of a twofold scholarly debate over (1) the author's intentions, and (2) the speech/writing polarity. The story covers the deposition and assassination of Osman II as well as the subsequent second reign of Mustafa I (May 1622-September 1623). After identifying the central historical account of the event, from which the entire historiographic story evolves, I propose a double reading of it: (1) the central text is interpreted as an oral address (i.e., a speech situation) delivered to and intended for a specific audience; (2) the central text is analyzed in terms of its use by seventeenth-century historians who integrated it into their histories and for whom this text represented a written artifact rather than a speech situation.<br>

Article Title: The Reader-"Another Production": The Reception of Haykal's Biography of Muhammad and the Shift of Egyptian Intellectuals to Islamic Subjects in the 1930s<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303101<br>
Date: 7 1, 1938<br>
Author(s): Al-Zayyat Israel<br>
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Article Title: Simile and Figurative Language<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303109<br>
Date: 7 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Woolf Louise Shabat<br>
Abstract: This article challenges the status of simile in some central contributions to the canonical tradition of metaphor theory, including those of Paul Henle, Winifred Nowottny, and Max Black. It claims that a trajectory leading to the defiguration of simile characterizes these theoretical interventions, since the privileging of metaphor as the "figure of figures, the figure for figurality" (Culler 1981: 189) is best served by the literalization of simile. I explore the manner in which simile is defigured through its subordination to theories of metaphor, as well as the critical and theoretical consequences of this process of defiguration for both metaphor and simile. Of central importance is the dynamic whereby the prima facie structural difference between metaphor and simile (the absence of connectives of similitude in the former, their presence in the latter) is made to bear the burden of simile's literality. The connective becomes the literal surplus which apparently devalues simile, according to the view that permeates modern rhetoric. A revisionist reading of the connective, anchored in an alternative theorization of the figurality of simile, is presented here. In addition, a sample corpus of figurative similes-in my reading-is analyzed in support of this alternative.<br>

Publisher: Philosophy of Science Association<br>
Issue: i302046<br>
Date: 6 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Wartofsky Patrick<br>
Abstract: The author proposes the thesis that all perception, including observation in natural science, is hermeneutical as well as causal; that is, the perceiver (or observer) learns to 'read' instrumental or other perceptual stimuli as one learns to read a text. This hermeneutical aspect at the heart of natural science is located where it might be least expected, within acts of scientific observation. In relation to the history of science, the question is addressed to what extent the hermeneutical component within scientific observation opens natural science to the charge of reflecting merely cultural values, and of providing merely a culturally acceptable reading of the "Book of Nature", rather than, as the author states, one stating universal antecedent conditions of possibility of cultural activity itself.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i20108002<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Prendeville Brendan<br>
Abstract: Painting is a mute art, abstract painting conspicuously so; how might its meanings be constituted in acts of painting and looking, respectively, without explicit and articulate guidance, always assuming that such meanings are not arbitrary? How might we identify these meanings, other than through 'reading' or decoding? Agnes Martin's work of the New York years suggests particular ways of answering such questions. Crucial factors are: the practical rather than axiomatic or geometric character of Martin's grids; the perceptual instability of her work; the 'dissonance' between rectangle and square, field and frame; the bodily address of the work; Martin's aspiration to make a new American art. Circumstantially important are the close friendships among the artists at Coenties Slip, as interpreted in photographs by Hans Namuth, and the marginal and temporary status of the loft community, set in the shadow of Wall Street, as viewed in the context of urban development. The argument is that the ethos of friendship and temporary community was particularly important in the formation of Martin's work, and helps in understanding the terms of our encounter with it. Here it is essential to recogn3ize the difference in historical situation between painter and viewer -- these indeed being works in respect to which situatedness is acutely felt. The argument is sustained with reference to: the phenomenology of embodied perception and tacit understanding (Todes and Merleau-Ponty); the dialectic between self-definition and subjection to power (Foucault); Gertrude Stein's modernism and "The Making of Americans".<br>

Issue: i20184615<br>
Date: 11 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Iguchi Kawori<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Abstract: As a tool for understanding the world in which we live the study of the history of political thought is stunted because of a preoccupation with the Western canon as the history of political thought to the exclusion of other histories and traditions. This ongoing exclusion is itself facilitated by a deeply entrenched select reading of the Western canon; a reading that overlooks a tendency within the canon to not just ignore but suppress and dismiss the value of other accounts of history and traditions of thought. An opening of the Western mind to these assumed to be alien traditions of social, legal and political thought reveals that, in the global market place of ideas, these purportedly competing and non-compatible traditions of thought might in fact have considerably more in common than what sets them apart: thus opening the way for an authentic inter-civilisational dialogue that focuses more on co-operation and less on clashes.<br>

Abstract: In this article I consider "narrative mind reading," the practical capability of inferring the motives that precipitate and underlie the actions of others. Following Jerome Bruner, I argue that this everyday capacity depends on our ability to place action within unfolding narrative contexts. While Bruner has focused on narrative mind reading as a within-culture affair, I look to border situations that cross race and class lines where there is a strong presumption among participants that they do not, in fact, share a cultural framework. Instead, interactions often reinforce actors' perceptions of mutual misunderstanding and cultural difference. Drawing on a longitudinal study of African American families who have children with severe illnesses, I examine narrative mind reading and misreading in one mother's interactions with the clinicians who treat her child. I further explore how narrative misreadings are supported through chart notes and "familiar stranger" stories. The focus on miscommunication grounds a theory of the reproduction of cultural difference in interactive dynamics and brings Bruner's emphasis on narrative into dialogue with contemporary anthropology of cultural borderlands.<br>

Abstract: Gaston Berger, le fondateur des Études philosophiques (1926), a joué un rôle décisif dans l'introduction intellectuelle, mais aussi matérielle et institutionnelle, de la phénoménologie de Husserl en France. À partir de documents inédits et d'une lecture, dès lors renouvelée, de la thèse sur Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, cette étude montre l'originalité de l'interprétation que donne Berger de la phénoménologie husserlienne, ainsi que les réserves qu'il formule à l'égard de certains thèmes: le moi absolu, la tension entre l'intention et l'intuition, sans oublier la réappropriation de la réduction phénoménologique sous le mode d'un détachement. En ce sens, il apparaît, d'une part, que Berger est un représentant typique de la première génération française des « disciples » de Husserl et que, d'autre part, la réception qu'il en fait est déjà révélatrice de problématiques propres à certains phénoménologues contemporains. Gaston Berger, the founder of Études philosophiques (1926), played a decisive role in the intellectual and also material and institutional introduction of Husserl's phenomenology into France. Based on unpublished documents permitting a new reading of his thesis Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, this study shows the originality of Berger's interpretation of Husserlian phenomenology, as well as the reservations he developed with regard to certain themes: the absolute ego, the tension between intention and intuition, not to mention the reappropriation of the phenomenological reduction by means of a detachment. In this sense, it appears, on the one hand, that Berger is a typical representative of the first French generation of « disciples » of Husserl and, on the other hand, that the reception he offered is itself revealing as to the problematics of certain contemporary phenomenologists.<br>

Abstract: En considérant la théâtralité moins comme l'essence du théâtre, lui-même haut lieu de la mimésis, que comme sa condition d'émergence, nous voulons mettre en évidence ce qui pourrait la révéler par-delà le texte et la scène: altérité, imprésentabilité, féminité. Bien que liée intimement au lieu et au jeu de la représentation, impliquant acteurs, spectateurs et décors, la théâtralité se présentera plus comme un lieu de créativité, un espace transitionnel où se joue (de) la vérité. On en en mesurera l'enjeu à travers une relecture intertextuelle de La naissance de la tragédie et de fragments posthumes de la même période, en interrogeant la légitimité d'un instinct théâtral qui serait l'une des formes essentielles du Kunsttrieb dont le destin est de procéder à une métaphorisation de « Dionysos agissant » et à une poétisation dévoilante de la vérité dont l'acteur deviendra finalement l'interprète en cela même qu'il en joue sur le mode de l'absence et qu'il ouvre un texte vers cet autre qui ne s'y présente jamais comme tel. Considering theatrality less as the essence of theatre, which is the high place for Mimesis, than the condition of its emergence, we would like to bring to force what could express it above text and performance: alterity, impresentability, feminity. Even if it seems closely related to place and acting of the representation, including the actors, the spectator and the setting, theatrality will prove to be a place for creativity, a transitional space in which truth can be performed. We will assess its stakes through a second intertextual reading of The Birth of Tragedy and of posthumous extracts from the same period; we can at the same time wonder over the legitimacy of a theatral instinct which would be one of the essential forms of the « Kunstriels »; its fate is to act as a metaphor of an « acting Dionysos » and to a revealing poetisation of truth for which the actor eventually turns out to be the interpret in so far as he plays on it on being absent ~<br>

Abstract: Some literary theorists have suggested that the process of reading is a complex one and is central to the interpretation of texts. These theorists do not ignore the creation of texts or the authors' creative activities, but place special emphasis on the role of the reader. This approach has relevance for the study of the use of libraries. This paper offers an analogy between text and library and between reader and library user. The analogy is possible because both reader and user adopt intentional stances with regard to that which is to be interpreted and employ cognitive and affective means in interpretation. At the heart of this approach is a phenomenological-hermeneutical way of thinking that treats reading and library use as an event consisting of varying intention and interpretive possibilities.<br>

Abstract: This close reading of one poem by Dickinson, « Crisis is sweet », wishes to demonstrate that the poet makes us share in a multiple experience of crisis combining sexual climax, mystical revelation, and the destruction of the poetic image. Positing a multi-level definition of crisis, the poem shows that the very process of definition — undoubtedly one of Dickinson's preferred modes of tackling with reality — entails a fundamental crisis and criticism of representation.<br>

Abstract: This paper suggests Charles Reznikoff's poetry should be assessed in its relation to the Jewish hermeneutical tradition. Philosopher Paul Ricœur's quotation in the title, "the very deciphering of life in the mirror of the text," sums up Reznikoff's poetical strategy. He decontextualizes his writing by displacing it towards its hypotextual origin, Jewish and non-Jewish. Reading destabilizes the reader who embraces the poetical text in the mirror of its hypotexts. This move metaphorically takes reading and writing away from their familiar American grounds and paves the way for an ethics of perambulation.<br>

Abstract: Gianni Gasparini is a sociologist and at the same time he is also a poet and a critic. The sociological glares of its work become, in the virtuous encounter with the poetical pen, as many literary reflectors on the human condition. It is necessary to comprise better, after the reading of its poem One hundred kites, if with Gasparini the poetic writing becomes sociology and if the sociology comes used for the construction of the poetic interlacing. If the poetry (and the literature) sociology is made because it narrates sociological types or because it puts in scene social processes sociological utopies like that many times over evoked of the «Community of the kites» composed from one hundred individuals «united and distinguished/communicating and silent».<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23013006<br>
Date: 5 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Gelbart Matthew<br>
Abstract: The Clash's London Calling was released just at the moment when the British punk movement seemed to be imploding. From the earliest reviews, it was received as a musical masterpiece that drew on many styles while still managing to be `punk' in some sense. This article argues that London Calling normalized punk, allowing it to be more than an event: punk could henceforth be assimilated into traditional musical discourse and aesthetics. As a careful balancing act between punk street-cred and mainstream musical values, London Calling allowed a double reading. Punk fans could find in it what they sought: anti-establishment anger and at times a messy, disdainful approach to conventional musicianship. At the same time critics and listeners who had come since the late sixties to assimilate rock into a Romantic (or post-Romantic) system of `art' values could find in it what they sought: stylistic growth, organic coherence, originality, and even a `universal' narrative of struggle, triumph, and redemption played out across the album. It is possible to isolate not only a story, but musical connections between the songs (keys, recurrent motifs, and topoi) all laid out in a logical manner. However, unlike concept albums in the seventies' progressive rock style against which punk reacted, London Calling often calls attention away from its musical coherence, and even its textual coherence, rather than towards it—such as by the last-minute addition of a bonus track that disrupts the narrative and key schemes established earlier. The ease with which the album can be praised in established musical language should not completely obscure its potential (and the general potential of punk) to undercut and confront conventional musical discourse.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo es un intento de aproximación a las singularidades de Pablo Neruda como lector, sobre la base de su doble condición de lector que hace un uso libre e intencionado de los textos, y de lector antilibresco. Examina dos vertientes de lecturas de Neruda, aquellas vinculadas con la tradición literaria —a las que el poeta denomina "el bosque de la literatura"—, y las otras, extra literarias, relacionadas con diversas disciplinas y con la historia del conocimiento. El artículo se ocupa también de la transición entre la lectura textual y la lectura del mundo en Neruda. This article intends to approach the peculiarities of Pablo Neruda as a reader, on the basis of his dual status of reader who makes a free and deliberate use of texts, and as a reader that neglects the intellectuality of books. In this light, two aspects of Neruda's readings are examined: those associated with the literary tradition which the poet calls "the forest of literature", and extra-literary readings related to varied disciplines and the history of knowledge. The article also discusses the transition between textual reading and the reading of the world in Neruda.<br>

Abstract: Derrida and Foucault provide key starting points to understanding archives. They see archives as hegemonic, characterizing ways of thought, modes of colonization, and the control of citizens. However, they also make clear that archives can be read subversively. With patience, counter-readings allow the excavation of the voices (sometimes names) of subaltern and otherwise suppressed others from the archive. By reading along and across the archival grain, researchers can follow the development of ideas and processes across historical periods. Archives can be seen as orphanages, containing surrogates of performances. Archives (paper and digital) also provide access to the results of anthropological research in ways mandated by ethics codes, but these are subject to controversy. What sorts of consent and what sorts of anonymization should be provided? Archives run by the groups traditionally studied by anthropologists provide models of radical archives that are very different from those conceived of by traditional archivists.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23351874<br>

Author(s): Doran Robert<br>
Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Abstract: Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism has influenced some American shools of literary criticism which aim at abolishing the distinction between literary and philosophical texts and, at the same time, deconstructing the text from its inherent meaning. If no text has any determined meaning, every interpretation is as correct as any other. This article examines some tenets of Derrida and his followers, especially their definitions of the words understanding, interpretation, and difference. It finds some surprizing affinities between Kant's formalistic esthetics and certain formalistic trends in modern criticism, in particular the concept of autonomy, which implies, in deconstructionism, the uniqueness of every text. However, if so, every reading is inevitably a 'misreading' or 'misinterpretation' thereof. This has led to the paradoxical and unwarranted conclusion that reading is impossible... The article questions some eccentric implications of this paralogism, for example, if no text is readable, does this apply to Derrida's writings as well? The article also calls attention to some interesting concepts of Jewish Kabala and of 'negative theology', which bear a striking resemblance to certain of Derrida's and other deconstructionists' ideas. Without diminishing the importance of Derrida's philosohpical work or the contribution of deconstructionism to modern hermeneutics, this article refutes certain nihilistic claims of the 'deconstructors' regarding philosophical hermeneutics and literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: The paper examines the process of figurative reading in the presence of a marker (like / as), namely the unique cognitive impact caused by shaping figurative expressions as similes. The solution is sought through theoretical discussion and analysis of relevant excerpts from Hebrew poetry. Recently Bethlehem argued that a simile does not necessarily indicate the presence of resemblance of some sort; the simile only presents itself as such via its marker, like/as, but actually it can bear a variety of figurative relations, of which metaphoric relations are only one possible option. Consequently, simile has only coincidental relations with metaphor, if any (Bethlehem, 1996: 1997) First I address this criticism, trying to reinforce the widespread view that a simile is indeed a sub-type of metaphor, and that there is no fundamental difference between them, that is, comprehension processes in metaphor and simile are basically similar. Next I distinguish the simile from the literal comparison in a new comprehensive way. Finally I try to identify and study the special impression a figurative expression might create as a result of being shaped as a simile. Despite this basic sameness of simile and metaphor, the marker's presence in a simile has its unique cognitive effects, accumulating to a distinctive impact. I analyze the unique cognitive effects potentially evolved during the construction process of the simile's meaning. In this analysis this paper reexamines central issues pertaining to similes, their essence, and the cognitive processes they trigger in readers. Among these I focus on a problem never thoroughly explored so far: the essential nature of the coexistence of similarity and dissimilarity (without working against each other) in both metaphor and simile.<br>

Abstract: This essay reflects on the politics and poetics of citation, and offers a constructive reading of Jonathan Z. Smith's work. This is accomplished by a careful, critical reading of Hugh Urban's trenchant critiques of Smith. I argue that the referential techniques through which Urban constructs his argument are highly selective and often manipulate the relevant texts. The final pages of the essay consider how, based on the techniques of citation employed, one can always produce a different reading. The essay thus serves as an "e.g." of how our methods and theories drive our use of data and create our object of study; or, as Smith puts it, scholars have no privileged "place on which to stand."<br>

Abstract: Text-books of former days have been rightly criticised for using the Bible in a lazy manner as a «mine of premises». The same reproach would apply to the historian of exegesis who would make no attempt to situate the texts in the horizon of their ancient authors. While the cultural context in which they thought and wrote was predominantly hellenistic, they owed much also to biblical methods of reading. It would, moreover, be difficult to understand their works without taking into account the polemic context in which they were written. Throwing light on each other, the great theologies allow us to draw the figure of Jesus Christ in mutually complementary perspectives.<br>

This Jewish hermeneutics accounts for polysemy and exegetical pluriformity, but at the same time — from the perspective of the oral Torah — strives for a halakhic reading of biblical texts.<br>

Abstract: Johann Georg Hamann saw the written word of God as the ultimate consequence of his incarnation. The biblical texts as well also carry the death of Christ in their essence as a figure of incarnation. Roland Barthes called the process of putting these texts into writing, by which the text gains autonomy in relation to the author, the "death of the author". In terms of the theology of the Holy Scriptures, this idea can be connected to the way people have been talking about the death of God in the modern age. One must however distinguish between the death of the author and the death of the text. This occurs when exegesis does not want to accept the death of the author. When however during reading there is a new understanding of biblical texts, this means to a certain extent their resurrection.<br>

Abstract: Cet article examine quelques moments décisifs de l'écriture de l'histoire au Brésil, ainsi que certaines spécificités de la pratique historiographique brésilienne au XXe et XXIe siècles. Nous nous intéresserons aux orientations théoriques, aux tendances analytiques, aux dialogues avec les courants historiographiques mondiaux, au travail critique des historiens sur ces pratiques, à leur définition de domaines d'intérêt, à leurs pratiques d'enquête et leurs conditions de travail avec les sources. Dans ce texte, nous aborderons deux champs thématiques choisis du fait de leur exemplarité : celui de l'histoire de la lecture et du livre, et celui de l'histoire de l'esclavage, avec comme problème de fond les implications politiques du travail historiographique et sa pertinence sociale. This article intends to reflect upon a few decisive moments of history writing in Brazil, as well as upon some specific aspects of Brazilian historiographic practices in the XX-XXI centuries. Our objective is to analyze them in regard to their theoretical framework; their analytical tendencies; their dialogue with other world historiographic trends; the critical thinking of historians on their own work; the definition of fields of interest; the investigative practices and the conditions of research. Our path in this text is anchored in two thematic domains chosen for their exemplarity: the history of reading and of the book; and the history of slavery, having as a backdrop the political implications of historiographic work and its social relevance. El presente artículo examina algunos de los momentos decisivos de la escritura de la historia en Brasil, así como algunas especificidades de la práctica historiográfica brasileña de los siglos XX y XXI.

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23653923<br>

Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: À Huancapi, dans les Andes du sud du Pérou, de nombreux témoignages attestent les apparitions miraculeuses du saint patron à l'époque de la violence politique des deux dernières décennies du XXe siècle. Comment comprendre ces récits qui portent sur des épisodes concrets de la guerre qui opposa l'armée régulière aux maoïstes du Sentier lumineux, et dans lesquels le saint patron se présenta aux différents acteurs armés pour les dissuader de malmener les villageois? Il s'agit d'analyser ici le discours politico-religieux de ces narrations ainsi que le singulier « travail de mémoire » de la guerre qu'elles contiennent. Nous voyons de quelle manière ces mémoires sanctifiées participent de l'élaboration d'une mémoire collective héroïque qui réinterprète autrement l'expérience douloureuse vécue par les habitants de Huancapi durant la guerre. In Huancapi, in the Andes of southern Peru, many people have testified to the miraculous apparitions of the village's patron saint during the war that ravaged the region during the last two decades of the twentieth century. How should these narratives be understood as they evoke specific episodes of a recent, violent history in which St. Luis apparently appeared to the conflict's different protagonists to discourage them from victimizing the villagers? We analyze the political and religious discourse embedded in these narratives and the singular “work on memories” of the war that it unveils. We show how the outstanding figure of the Saint participated in the development of an iconic memory: a heroic and victorious memory that offers another reading of the painful experience of the villagers. En Huancapi, en los Andes del sur del Perú, varios testimonios confirman las apariciones milagrosas del santo patrono durante la época de la violencia política de las dos últimas décadas del siglo XX. ¿Cómo entender estos relatos acerca de episodios concretos de la guerra que opuso el ejército peruano con los maoístas de Sendero luminoso, en los cu~<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23916373<br>
Date: 6 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Velaidum Joe<br>
Abstract: This paper addresses Northrop Frye's biblical hermeneutic. Frye intends his interpretation of the Bible to be 'literary' (as opposed to theological) which for him means that it explicates how or why a poet reads the Bible. In so doing, Frye employs typology, believing that he is able to eliminate the theological elements of typology in his purely literary interpretation of biblical texts. However, a closer examination of typology itself shows that when it is applied to the Bible, as it is in Frye's writings, typology cannot be divorced from its theological foundations. Contrary to Frye's belief that his biblical hermeneutic is a non-theological interpretation of biblical imagery, I argue that Christian typology provides the inescapable framework for Frye's reading of the Bible.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917902<br>
Date: 3 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Cunningham Valentine<br>
Abstract: Bible reading occurs at intersection of perpetually shifting canons—of textual meaning, interpretative strategies, and preferred textual menu for particular contemporary consumption. Such continual up-to-datedness is the Bible's, as it is the classic's, only survival kit. Contemporary reading is the only reading—ever. Post-modernism's biblical reading menu is notable for its post-modernist yields of meaning; but textual post-modernism—aporias, textual unboundedness, canonical on-edgedness, apocryphalism, etcetera—is typical of biblical texts' ur-post-modernism (the Bible living up, of course, to applied post-modernist reading expectations). All such reading is an aestheticisation, a fictionalising process—abusive naturally; constructively abusive, perhaps; but always catachretical, demythologising, a negative theology. But, of course, this is utterly inevitable for now.<br>

Author(s): Loughlin Gerard<br>
Abstract: This essay argues for an understanding of the literal sense of Scripture after its diremption in the modern period between the written and the historical. It introduces John Spong as exemplary of a liberal tendency to disparage the literal, and Hans Frei as showing how the sensus literalis was, and may be again, found in the 'world' of the scriptural narrative, and how it came to be dirempted. Finally I argue that the literal sense of Scripture is locatable in the mutual constitution of Church and Scripture, of text and reading-community. The literal and historical are rebound insofar as the Church performs the letter of the text.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23919272<br>
Date: 9 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Anderson Pamela Sue<br>
Abstract: I propose both a critique of canonicity and a feminist defence of the careful re-reading of certain canonical texts. My proposal for a critique of the limits of our thinking about and with texts is informed by a re-reading of the canonical text of Kant. Admittedly Kant himself might be excluded from any possible feminist canon whether in literary theory or theology. However, my qualified defence of the Kantian text is part of a larger concern to rethink texts by men and women. The aim is not to reaffirm a conservative culture, but to provide crucial tools for the judgements and practices of still highly significant forms of critical hermeneutics. In particular, the process of suppression and repression of valuable texts by women and minorities cannot properly be reversed without taking seriously the particular skills of post-Kantian critique. Critical and historical skills will help distinguish when to think merely about a text and when to think with it so that we might come up with a new picture of canon.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Mills Kevin<br>
Abstract: This paper sets out to question contemporary notions of language which employ metaphors of imprisonment or confinement to describe the alleged failure of the word to connect with the world. Valentine Cunningham's recent book. In the Reading Gaol, is confronted with Helen Keller's experience of being excluded from language (as described in her autobiography), in order to argue that the issue of hermeneutic freedom needs to be rethought. This involves raising certain doubts about freedom—doubts identified by means of a consideration of the cases of New Testament prisoners: Peter, John, Paul and Silas. I conclude that freedom, confronted by doubt (evident in ascetical gestures) is produced by a hermeneutics of hope. Hope, constituted by its own rivenness, both allows and limits the effects of hermeneutical suspicion. The imprisoning effect ascribed to language can then be seen as a failure with regard to hope.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922199<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Morgan Ben<br>
Abstract: The article uses a reading of Eliot's Middlemarch and a discussion of Levinas and Heidegger to challenge two aspects of the approach to literary texts proposed by Toril Moi. I suggest that we needn't assume that the inner lives of others are inaccessible in the way Moi (following Stanley Cavell) does, nor that literature has a privileged role in helping us come to terms with this alterity. Literature is one practice amongst others with which relations with other people are negotiated more or less honestly. I argue that recent developments in phenomenology and cognitive science, in particular the focus on enactive and participatory models of being in the world, can help to make more concrete Heidegger's concept of being-with (Mitsein) and Levinas' concept of proximité. Heidegger and Levinas' can then take their place in a counter tradition of 20th-century thinkers who engage with human togetherness rather than declare it to be impossible. The question Heidegger and Levinas' raise about the ethical challenge of human togetherness is not, however, answered by more recent research. It is by turning back to Middlemarch and viewing it in the context of its original marketing that we can see one way that this challenge may be confronted in everyday life.<br>

Author(s): Wallace Cynthia R.<br>
Abstract: Religious echoes are resonant with race and gender in Beloved, raising questions best posed in a psychoanalytic register. Freud's sceptical questioning of religion is important for a consideration of the gendered, raced, and specifically religious subjectivities explored in the novel, as is Lacan's paradigm of entry into the symbolic order. Reading the religious in Beloved in light of both Freud and Lacan, and reading the poetically evocative Word in all three, I locate within the novel a profound ambivalence, an awareness of the limitations of language under the Name of the Father and the necessity—even potential good—of imagining within its system.<br>

Abstract: This essay outlines and illustrates ways that 'theological humanism' provides methodological possibilities for scholars working in religion and literary studies. I suggest there is a need to investigate more humanistic methods of interpreting literature by exploring approaches that engage questions of sacred depth. After stressing the necessary paradoxes of theological humanism as an interpretive and lived stance in the world, I offer a reading of Margaret Edson's Wit that is shaped by these principles.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922202<br>
Date: 9 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Hass Andrew W.<br>
Abstract: The following essay explores the nature of theory within the interdisciplinary space we call literature and theology—or more generally religion and literature—and the role theory has played in that space's collective practice. It argues that theory is natural to the 'binding' of religion with literature and of literature with religion, since both are caught in a dilemma of reading, including the 'reading' of the practices that mark each of their respective disciplines. The discussion then looks at the spectatorial nature of the ancient notion of theory as theoria, before it traces how theory, in moving from theoria to high Theory, has figured in the 25 volumes of Literature and Theology itself. This tracing covers a double assumption of theory and an appropriation of the 'other' as theory. The essay concludes by looking at the dynamic that continues to bind literature and theology, and indeed the readers of a journal such as this one, in a communality of theory, practice, and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Monter, pp. 83-84 : "Consider the example of one such pseudo-saint, Angela Mellini, tried by
the Bologna Inquisition in 1698. An illiterate seamstress in her mid-thirties, she had joined the
Ursulines, the lay sisterhood which taught reading poor girls. More to the point, Mellini was an
autonomous woman who kept changing confessors until she found one to her liking and
subsequently enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with him. After a few years, she had managed her
spiritual exercise of prolonged meditation well enough to have numerous visions, including one at
Christmas time, in which the Virgin handed her the newborn Christ-child and Mellini began to
nurse him feeling considerable physical sensations. She had also avowed her sexual desires toward
her confessor; he answered by describing his own sexual desires toward other women and begged
her to pray for him to keep him continent. After about a year he taught her to write so that she
could keep a spiritual diary (which survives). Whenever she confessed, which was often, because
she took communion several times a week, they would bless each other, in Latin. He had taken to
calling her madre, even mama.... This was clearly not 'spiritual guidance' as the Council of
Trent understood it. One of Mellini's friends and co-workers finally denounced her to the

Abstract: The curriculum for biblical studies in the Israeli public high school system is designated by the official program of the ministry of education to be taught along essentially critical lines based on historical-philological research tools. The aim of this article is to expound on the cultural consequences and hermeneutical problems which are a direct product of this prescription, with emphasis on three major points: first, the fact that the official program of studies has completely disregarded contemporary hermeneutical approaches; second, the import of this hermeneutic deficiency given a literal reading of the biblical text which is meager in descriptive details but is hermeneutically saturated; third, the cultural status of the Bible class as sole agent of socialization pertaining to Jewish knowledge in Israeli public high-schools.<br>

Article Title: Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): van den Broek Paul<br>
Abstract: Text interpretation – the main interest of discourse analysts – is a central component of the text understanding process. In this article we introduce the Landscape Model, which describes the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension in a detailed and precise manner. Moreover, this model captures the interpretative processes in which the human mind engages during reading. Within the context of the Landscape Model, we describe the relation between discourse understanding and discourse interpretation, and explain some of the phenomena that are central to the field of discourse analysis as seen from a cognitive perspective. In the first section we describe the basic cognitive processes that underlie discourse understanding, as captured by the Landscape Model. In the following section we illustrate the way that the Landscape Model can be applied to the work of discourse analysts. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the cognitive Landscape Model for the field of discourse analysis.<br>

Article Title: PLURALISMUS – ETHISCHE GRUNDINTUITION – KIRCHE<br>
Publisher: VERLAG HERDER<br>
Issue: i24164415<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Guggenberger Wilhelm<br>
Abstract: This article tries to give an outline of Christian ethics in a pluralistic world most clearly characterized by its Babel of moral languages. There is no longer any single valid moral language. The liberal solution to establish a neutral moral language – a moral Esperanto – to solve this crisis of modernity is not possible without turning into some sort of moral imperialism. To avoid, however, the other extreme – nihilism – this article follows to some degree "communitarian" thinkers like A. MacIntyre, J. Stout and M. Walzer. Every ethics must be rooted in a narrative tradition and needs a concrete community as its precondition. The second part of this article addresses the narrative structure of Christian ethics. At first it follows MacIntyre's insight that every ethics is based on myth. It differs, however, from MacIntyre's position by putting special emphasis on the substantial content of the Christian "myth". With the help of Girard's mimetic theory this article distinguishes between archaic myths that are the product of the scapegoat mechanism and identify with the view of the lynch mob and the Biblical history of salvation that consists of a story written from the perspective of the victims of collective persecution. In the center of Christian ethics we find the example of Jesus Christ – the victim of collective violence par excellence – and the example of those of his disciples who became aware of their own contribution to Jesus's death and converted to the side of the victim. The third part of this article addresses the question of the concrete community that makes Christian ethics possible. Again MacIntyre's communitarian emphasis on the connection between concrete communities and ethics is taken as a starting point. Whereas communitarians, however, tend to support patriotism the community necessitated by Christian ethics is the universal Church. Patriotism like the ancient Greek polis is essentially characterized by its enmity to outside communities, a frie~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i24438933<br>
Date: 4 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): MacAVOY LESLIE<br>
Abstract: In this paper I take issue with Heidegger's use of the concept of death as a means of disclosing human finitude. I argue that Being-towards-death is inadequate to the disclosure of Dasein's thrownness which is necessary for the kind of authentic historizing that Heidegger describes and furthermore leads to a reading of authenticity which is preclusive of Being-with-Others. I suggest that this difficulty may be alleviated through increased attention to the opposite boundary of Dasein's existence, namely its birth. Although I do not pursue the project here of conducting a phenomenology of birth, I suggest some directions for proceeding with that task, and I illustrate that a greater emphasis on Dasein's beginning will increase the richness of our understanding of our Being-with-Others.<br>

Publisher: ARMAND COLIN<br>
Issue: i24466320<br>
Date: 6 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): SEIGNAN Gérard<br>
Abstract: Au début du XIXe siècle, la philosophie de l'âme fournit des arguments aux psychologues qui, à la fin de ce siècle, réfléchissent sur les faits de conscience. Ils mettent alors en évidence les caractéristiques psychophysiologiques de l' « effort volontaire », force psychique qu'ils insèrent dans une phénoménologie de l'agir. Dans la première moitié du XXe siècle, de nouveaux discours reformulent la trame conceptuelle élaborée au siècle précédent et les psychologues, attentifs aux procédures adaptatives de l'énergétique humaine, livrent un autre mode de lisibilité de l'effort quand celui-ci représente, avant tout, un combat pour (sur)vivre. Early 19th-century philosophy of the mind or soul would provide arguments for psychologists who, at the end of this century, inquired into the facts of consciousness. They in turn highlighted the psychophysiologic characteristics of « voluntary effort », a psychic force that they placed within a phenomenology of the act. In the first half of the 20th century new discourses reformulated the elaborate conceptual framework of the previous century, and the psychologists attentive to the adaptive procedure of human energetics, offered a different reading of what effort means when it represents above all a struggle for survival.<br>

Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
Issue: i24482950<br>
Date: 1 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): GUTIÉRREZ RAFAEL ROJAS<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the relationship between poetics and politics in Martí's work. By way of an archeology of the political images in his poetry (Ismaelillo, Versos sencillos, Versos libres) and, conversely, of the poetic representations that abound in his prose and oratory, the author argues for a tension between the two textual dimensions that is never quite resolved or diluted within a discursive or historical synthesis. And yet, the authorial schism is not exactly a fault to be "corrected" by critical reading, but rather the very axis of a martinian hermeneutics. Este ensayo explora las relaciones entre poética y política dentro de la escritura de José Martí. A través de una arqueología de las imágenes políticas que aparecen en su poesía (Ismaelillo, Versos sencillos y Versos libres) y, a la inversa, de las representaciones poéticas que abundan en la oratoria y la prosa de Martí, el autor sostiene que esos dos mundos del texto viven siempre en tensión, sin que ambas identidades textuales puedan diluirse en una síntesis discursiva o histórica. Sin embargo, la escisión de la autoría no es, aquí, una falla que el crítico debe "corregir", sino el eje de una hermenéutica del sujeto martiano.<br>

as a sufficient reading. See similarly J. Brockington, Review of Rethinking the

both "pondering the meaning" and (as I was certainly aware) "keeping in mind
his purpose," but not "no more than" the latter.<br>

Abstract: It is important, however, to note Johan van der Hoeven's corrections of C. T. Mclntire's
reading of Dooyeweerd on history (in Philosophia Reformata 52 lno.2, 19871: 194-202).
Jan Dengerink's precision on the respective understanding of 'historicism' by Vollen-
hoven and Dooyeweerd, as he calls Jacob Klapwijk to precision on exegeting Dooye-
weerd's view of 'ontsluiting', is also, 1 think, on target ('Hen brug te ver', in Philosophia
Reformata 53 (no.l, 19881: 17-22). Sander Griffioen's incisive article on 'De Betekenis van
Dooyeweerd's Ontwikkelingsidee' is particularly helpful in delineating the nuances of
Dooyeweerd's reflections (Philosophia Reformata 51 (nos. 1-2, 1986): 83-109).<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, op.cit., p. 156. The tremendous difficulties we face in developing an
adequate view of evil are well illustrated by the fact that Ricoeur himself, despite his clear
intentions to the contrary, works with a view of human "fault" in Fallible Man (Chicago:
Henry, 1965) which itself comes very close to reading sin and evil into the fundamental
human structure. See the Master's thesis of Henry Venema, Philosophical Anthropology, and the

for Christian Studies, 1986).<br>

Abstract: In this context, Dooyeweerd's reading of Stoker seems misleading. When Stoker suggests
that his concept of substance gives a better expression to "the autonomous being and value of
the cosmos with respect to God" {die eien zijn en die eienwaarde van die kosmos teenover God),
Dooyeweerd fears that the radical biblical view of the dependence of all creation upon God is
somehow being threatened (NC, III, 71). But this overlooks precisely the point Stoker is
affirming: namely, the real difference instituted between the Creator and His creation by the
very act of creating. Accordingly, creation is not self-sufficient; but it is not nothing; it is
something. (Cf. Zigterman, op.cit., pp. 129,132,136.)<br>

Abstract: Dooyeweerd does indeed speak of actual transcending of cosmic time. In the well-known
note in NC I, 31-32, in reaction to the Divergentierapport I' written by Vollenhoven and
circulating among board members of the Association for Calvinistic Philosophy, he writes:
" (...) Some seek the concentration-point of human existence in time and suppose, that this
religious centre must certainly be pre-functional but not supra-temporal. But, at least within
the horizon of cosmic time we have no single experience of something 'pre-functional', i.e.
of anything that would transcend the modal diversity of the aspects. We gain this
experience only in the religious concentration of the radix of our existence upon the
absolute Origin. In this concentration we transcend cosmic time. How could man direct
himself toward eternal things, if eternity were not 'set in his heart'? Even the idolatrous
absolutizing of the temporal cannot be explained from the temporal horizon of human
existence. For the latter nowhere provides a point of contact for an idea of the absolute,
unless it be related apriori to the supra-temporal. This act of concentration presupposes a
supra-temporal starting-point in our consciousness.
This, however, is not to say that the religious centre of human existence is found in a rigid
and static immobility. That is a metaphysical-Greek idea of supra-temporality."
Reading this passage we should realize that Dooyeweerd's notion of time refers to cosmic time,
which is related to modal diversity (and coherence) rather than transience. This is the reason
why Dooyeweerd cannot but say that the unity of existence can only be grasped by
transcending temporal diversity. So, we can conclude that the difference between Dooyeweerd
and Vollenhoven with respect to the supra-temporality of the heart depends on different views
on time and the cosmic time order. Vollenhoven's rejection of the notion of cosmic time order
and his exclusion of numerical and spatial modal qualifications fr~<br>

Abstract: L'article examine la lecture, par Hegel, de la critique kantienne de la métaphysique de l'âme et la conception hégélienne de l'âme comme « esprit-nature ». La question est de savoir ce que Hegel retient de la critique kantienne et en quoi, cependant, elle lui semble méthodologiquement inappropriée. Plus fondamentalement, il s'agit de saisir en quel sens les prédicats reconnus à l'âme dans la métaphysique dogmatique se trouvent « relevés » dans la conception hégélienne de l'esprit. The paper considers Hegel's reading of Kant's critique of the metaphysics of the soul and Hegel's conception of the soul as "natural spirit". The question is what Hegel retains from the Kantian critique and why it seems to him, nevertheless, to be methodologically inappropriate. More fundamentally, the aim of the paper is to grasp in which sense the predicates of the soul according dogmatic metaphysics are "sublated" in Hegelian conception of spirit.<br>

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de François Laplanche prend délibérément pour objet la longue durée : l'exégèse biblique entretient un rapport constant au Texte originel et l'historien ne peut s'exonérer de connaître les interprétations patristiques et médiévales de la Bible. L'histoire d'une pratique de lecture savante est ici réintégrée à l'intérieur de l'ensemble de la culture, de la société et des événements d'une période donnée. Prenant pour centre d'analyse les théologiens calvinistes de Saumur vers 1620-1670, François Laplanche montre que, tandis que leur système demeure arrimé à l'orthodoxie réformée, ils la minent et conduisent à une désacralisation de l'Écriture par un double éloignement : éloignement de l'origine puisque la disqualification de l'Ancien Testament le transforme en objet d'histoire; éloignement de la fin des temps par la récusation catégorique du prophétisme et du millénarisme. The work of François Laplanche deliberately deals with long duration: biblical exegesis maintains a constant relationship to the original Text and the historian cannot exempt himself from knowing the patristic and medieval interpretations of the Bible. The history of scholarly reading is here reinstated within the culture, society and events of a given period. Taking as the center of his analysis the Calvinist theologians of Saumur around 1620-1670, François Laplanche shows that, while their system remains linked to reformed orthodoxy, they are undermining it and go towards a desecration of Scripture via a double remoteness: remoteness from the origin since the disqualification of the Old Testament transforms it into an historical object; remoteness from the end of time via the adamant disqualification of prophecy and millenarianism. La obra de François Laplanche toma deliberadamente como objeto la larga duración: la exégesis bíblica establece una relación constante con el Texto original y el historiador no puede eximirse de conocer las interpretaciones patrísticas y medievales de la Biblia.~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i25165879<br>
Date: 12 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Libesman Heidi<br>
Abstract: The focus of this article is the theory of integration advanced by Alan Cairns in his book, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian State". Cairns' theory has had a mixed reception since its publication. Like much scholarship and public policy in the Aboriginal rights field, "Citizens Plus" has attracted strong proponents and opponents. At present "Citizens Plus" remains one of the primary competitors vying for influence in guiding the postcolonial reconfiguration of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian state and civil society on terms of justice that may be perceived as legitimate by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. The prime alternative, as conceived by both Cairns and his critics, is the nation-to-nation constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The author provides a political theoretical reading of "Citizens Plus". She seeks to disclose the normative and conceptual structure of Cairns' argument and to situate Cairns' theory in the context of debates concerning the future of Aboriginal peoples and the constitution of Canada. This reading foregrounds an alternative interpretation of the relationship between "Citizens Plus" and the constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which makes it possible to see them as complementary rather than opposed constitutional visions. The author also raises broader questions concerning the reasons for continuing the search, at the heart of Cairns' work, for a post-colonial theory and praxis of normative integration in diverse societies, and the conditions of the possibility of such a theory and praxis. Ultimately the author argues that whether one agrees or disagrees with Cairns' prescription, at a minimum "Citizens Plus" should be understood as raising a fundamental question to which multinational constitutional theory must respond. /// Le présent article a pour objet d'examiner la théorie avancée par Alan Cairns dans son ouvrage, "Ci~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25478832<br>
Date: 5 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Kansteiner Wulf<br>
Abstract: This essay provides a close reading of Saul Friedländer's exceptionally successful comprehensive history of the Holocaust from the theoretical perspective of Hayden White's philosophy of history. Friedländer's The Years of Extermination has been celebrated as the first synthetic history of the "Final Solution" that acknowledges the experiences of the victims of Nazi genocide. But Friedländer has not simply added the voices of the victims to a conventional historical account of the Holocaust. Instead, by displacing linear notions of time and space and subtly deconstructing conventional concepts of causality, he has invented a new type of historical prose that performs rather than analyzes the victims' point of view. Friedländer's innovation has particularly radical consequences for the construction of historical explanations. On the one hand, Friedländer explicitly argues that anti-Semitism was the single most important cause of the Holocaust. On the other hand, his transnational, multifaceted history of the "Final Solution" provides a wealth of data that escapes the conceptual grasp of his explicit model of causation. Friedländer chooses this radically self-reflexive strategy of historical representation to impress on the reader the existential sense of disbelief with which the victims experienced Nazi persecution. To Friedländer, that sense of disbelief constitutes the most appropriate ethical response to the Holocaust. Thus the narratological analysis of The Years of Extermination reveals that the exceptional quality of the book, as well as presumably its success, is the result of an extraordinarily creative act of narrative imagination. Or, put into terms developed by White, who shares Friedländer's appreciation of modernist forms of writing, The Years of Extermination is the first modernist history of the Holocaust that captures, through literary figuration, an important and long neglected reality of the "Final Solution."<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>
Issue: i25479101<br>
Date: 7 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Soroka Mykola Iv.<br>
Abstract: Because of the close association between ideology and utopia, Volodymyr Vynnychenko's three-volume utopian novel "Soniachna mashyna" (1921-24, published in 1928), one of the most well known and discussed works in Ukrainian literature, has more often been approached as a product of his political and ideological preoccupations. While I do not disregard this, in my paper I propose a new reading from a largely neglected perspective of geographical displacement as a social, cultural and psychological phenomenon in an effort to bring fresh theoretical insight into the study of utopian writings. It maintains that Vynnychenko's utopia was largely inspired by his involuntary stay outside his homeland, in Germany, which led to a state of existential uncertainty, feelings of extreme uprootedness, and the desire to overcome this conflict with the reality of his day. The paper examines the writer's personal attitude to his displacement and uses the theoretical paradigm of utopia and nostalgia to argue that his utopia was aimed at a 'reconstruction' of his highly unstable identity by transcending the intolerable present and a projection of a better future.<br>

Abstract: Amid the debates over the meaning and usefulness of the word "culture" during the 1980s and 1990s, practice theory emerged as a framework for analysis and criticism in cultural anthropology. Although theorists have gradually begun to explore practice-oriented frameworks as promising vistas in cultural anthropology and the study of religion, these remain relatively recent developments that stand to be historically explicated and conceptually refined. This article assesses several ways that practice theory has been articulated by some of its chief expositors and critics, and places these developments in conversation with comparable accounts of "social practices" by recent pragmatist philosophers. My aim in generating such a conversation is to illuminate the ways that Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work provides important resources for cultural analysis that are already implicit in practice theory, yet either frequently overlooked or dismissed by practice theorists. I demonstrate how a Wittgensteinian understanding of practice theory coheres with, and illuminates, Clifford Geertz's account of meaning, thick description, and religious practices. Reading Geertz as a practice theorist, I argue, helps alleviate the apparent opposition between assessing meaning and analyzing power in the study of religious practices and institutions, and unsettles dichotomous accounts of belief and intentional action.<br>

Abstract: The last two decades have been fascinating and productive ones for theorists of religion. Recent work has offered a remarkably wide range of theoretical perspectives and possibilities that enrich our field even as they plunge us into vigorous theoretical debates. Amidst this contest-even confusion-some basic principles for guiding future work seem to be asserting themselves. Many think that, after a century of confusion and intermingling between theology and the study of religion, scholars of religion are finally in a position to establish the study of religion on properly academic, theoretical foundations. In this story Eliade's antireductionist discourse of the "sacred" becomes the epitome and, it is hoped, the last gasp of religious studies as a quasi-theological discourse. Yet despite their efforts to guide the study of religion away from Eliade, many remain Eliadan insofar as they accept Eliade's "locative" approach to religion. Yet is it really "theology" that is currently limiting the way we "imagine religion," or might it be instead the refusal to think beyond religion's locative function-a refusal very closely linked to the desire for academic respectability in a historicist age? Mark C. Taylor's After God provocatively disturbs the idea that religion is primarily locative and, in doing so, also disturbs the boundaries between the theological and the theoretical, religion and the study of religion. I consider the significance of this virtual map of religion, by reading After God with and against J. Z. Smith's early reflections or experiments with the ideas of chaos, incongruity, and location. I argue that Taylor's book leads us back to paths from which Smith turned in his early work.<br>

Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: This essay traces the involution of anthropological understanding from the 1950s to the present. It is shown that as the conception of "doing ethnography" changed from sensing patterns to reading texts, and from reading texts to writing culture, so too did the content of anthropological knowledge change from being multi-sensory to being self-centred. The essay also proposes a way of escaping the tunnel-vision of contemporary (post-modern) ethnography — namely, by treating cultures as constituted by a particular interplay of the senses which the ethnographer must simulate before making any attempt to describe or evoke the culture under study. /// Cet article trace l'enchevêtrement qu'a subi l'étude de l'anthropologie depuis les années cinquante à nos jours. L'auteur démontre que le concept de "faire de l'ethnographie" a changé radicalement — de la perception sensorielle à la lecture des textes et de cette lecture à l'acte d'écrire une culture. Également, le contenu des connaissances anthropologiques a subi un changement du multi-sensoriel à l'égocentrique. L'article propose comment s'éloigner du champ de vue plutôt étroit de l'ethnographie contemporaine (dite post-moderne) en suggérant que les ethnographes traitent les cultures telles que constituées par l'action réciproque particulière des sens qui doivent être simulés avant que les ethnographes puissent essayer de décrire ou d'évoquer la culture en question.<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo proporciona una lectura actualizada de las llamadas 'novelas históricas' o 'novelas de ciudad' de Carlos Droguett. En particular, sus novelas centradas en la conquista y fundación de la ciudad de Santiago (100 gotas de sangre y 200 de sudor y Supay el cristiano) señalan la primera coordenada del proyecto narrativo droguettiano orientado a reelaborar y reescribir la historia chilena y latinoamericana, en una historiografía-literaria que busca sus fuentes, su prueba documental, en el enorme archivo conformado por toda esa sangre, por todas esas muertes soslayadas "con silencio o con ruido". 100 gotas de sangre y 200 de sudor y Supay el cristiano constituyen las primeras páginas de lo que aquí denominaremos "La Historia de Chile según Carlos Droguett". Pero, además, ambas novelas serían tributarias de la fuente documental previamente elaborada y narrativizada por el historiador Crescente Errázuriz en su Historia de Chile bajo Pedro de Valdivia. The present article provides an up-to-date reading of the so called 'historical novels' or 'city novels' by Carlos Droguett. In particular, his novels focused on the conquest and founding of the city of Santiago (100 Gotas de Sangre y 200 de Sudor and Supay el cristiano) mark the droguettian narrative project first's coordinate, oriented towards a remaking and rewriting of the Chilean and Latin American history, in a literary-historiography which looks for its sources, its documentary evidence, within the enormous archive conformed by all that blood, all those deaths eluded "with silence or noise". 100 Gotas de Sangre y 200 de Sudor and Supay el cristiano are the first pages of what we here call Chilean History according to Carlos Droguett. But, in addition, both novels would be tributary of the documentary source previously elaborated by the historian Crescente Errázuriz in his Historia de Chile bajo Pedro de Valdivia.<br>

Author(s): Ginzburg Carlo<br>
Abstract: Le titre de l'essai a deux significations: il fait allusion, d'un côté, à des lectures qui ont joué un rôle important dans le travail de Marcel Mauss sur le don (notamment, Bronislaw Malinowski et Franz Boas); de l'autre, à quelques lectures importantes qui ont été données de l'Essai sur le don. Les deux niveaux sont liés: l'un clarifie l'autre. Plus spécifiquement, l'essai montre que la réflexion sur le lien impliqué par l'obligation de rendre le don (thème qui est au centre de l'essai de Mauss) a été déclenchée par une lecture très originale de certains passages de l'Émile de Rousseau. Il suit les traces, directes et indirectes, de ce noyau rousseauiste dans la postérité de l'essai de Mauss: de l'interprétation de Hegel donnée par Alexandre Kojève aux lectures divergentes de Mauss données par Claude Lévi-Strauss et Claude Lefort — fondées sur, respectivement, une image non conflictuelle et une image conflictuelle de la société. The paper's title refers, on the one hand, to Mauss's readings for his essay on the gift (from Bronislaw Malinowski to Franz Boas); on the other, to some readings of Mauss's essay by others. The two levels are connected: the former clarifies the latter. More specifically, the paper argues that the reflection on the bond implied by the constraint to reciprocate the gift (an issue which is at the very center of the essay) is the outcome of Mauss's highly original reading of some passages in Rousseau's Émile. The paper follows the posterity, both direct and indirect, of this Rousseauian core in Mauss's essay and its readers, from Alexandre Kojève's interpretation of Hegel, to the divergent readings of Mauss's provided by Claude Lévi-Strauss and Claude Lefort—based on, respectively, a non-conflictual and a conflictual image of society.<br>

Publisher: ABBAYE DU MONT CÉSAR<br>
Issue: i26189080<br>
Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Laird Martin S.<br>
Abstract: It is unclear how useful the stage-approach adopted by Chadwick is when
attempting to grasp something of the subtelty of Cassian's doctrine of prayer. For
example, in Conference Nine, 16 Cassian says it is impossible "for our spirit to
attain those more exalted modes of prayer of which I have been speaking except
by the step-by-step journey upward through ail those pleas we pour forth (p.
110)." This passage indicates a successive view of the phases of the spiritual life.
However, in the preceding chapters Cassian discusses différent sources and types
of prayer and to whom each is particularly well-suited. But then he says that a
soul that has become rooted in a State of purity "takes on ail the forms of prayer
at the same time. It flies from one to the other, like an uncontrollable grasping
fire (9,15 [p. 110])". This, by contrast, would seem to indicate transcendence of
a strictly phasic view of the life of prayer. This is something to keep in mind
when reading contemplative authors, who often do not ascribe the chronological
fixity to stages in the spiritual life that modems ascribe to stages in psychologi-
cal development (e.g., the work of A. Maslow). So, for example, while Origen
sees stages as successive, Gregory of Nyssa allows for an overlapping of stages
(see A. Louth. The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition [Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 1981], p. 82).<br>

Abstract: L'auteur porte un regard critique sur la construction d'un objet historique qui, pour retracer l'histoire des pratiques de lecture sur le long terme (des années trente à nos jours) et cerner les processus d'appropriation des textes lus en milieu ouvrier, a nécessité le recours à une démarche d'investigation en histoire orale. Il aborde donc les grandes questions méthodologiques puis précise quelques résultats de l'analyse des discours en insistant sur leur apport fructueux pour l'histoire socioculturelle. The author takes a critical look at the construction of an historical object which, in order to relate the history of reading practices over the long term (from the 1930s to today) and bring to the fore the appropriation process of texts read in a working class milieu, meant undertaking an investigation involving oral history. It discusses the main methodological questions and then indicates some results of the analysis of the discourse, while insisting on their fruitful contribution to socio-cultural history.<br>

Abstract: Cet article retrace le parcours singulier d'Arlette Farge. L'historienne y évoque sa propre trajectoire scientifique, parlant des rencontres qui ont joué un rôle déterminant dans l'évolution de ses recherches (Philippe Ariès, Michel Foucault). Elle revient sur ses ouvrages, rappelant l'intention qui a présidé à leur élaboration dans le contexte dans lequel ils ont été préparés et écrits. Enfin, l'entretien est l'occasion pour l'historienne d'évoquer son rapport à la discipline et aux autres sciences sociales, ou encore ses manières de lire les archives et d'écrire pour construire une « histoire de l'infime ». This article recounts the unusual intellectual journey undertaken by Arlette Farge. The historian recalls the scientific path she followed, including a discussion of her encounters with Philippe Ariès and Michel Foucault, both of which played a decisive role in the development of her research. She goes back over her published works, remembering the intentions that motivated them and the context in which they were researched and written. Finally, the interview offers the historian an opportunity to talk about her relationship to the discipline of history itself and to the other social sciences, and how she goes about reading historical records and writing in order to construct a "history of minute details".<br>

Article Title: GRAMSCI RITROVATO TRA CIRESE E I CULTURAL STUDIES<br>
Publisher: Leo S. Olschki<br>
Issue: e26230922<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Abstract: In 2008, as a follow-up to the initiative taken the previous year, ISRE – Istituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico
         [Superior Regional Ethnographic Institute]organized the seminarGramsci ritrovato, tra Cirese e i Cultural Studies(Nuoro, October 24th- 25th, 2008)[Gramsci rediscovered: between Cirese and the Cultural Studies]. The seminar focused on another ‘find’: the readings of Gramsci’s works on folklore that Cirese had elaborated thirty-eight years before. The idea came from Giorgio Baratta, who – in hisGramsci in contrappunto [Gramsci in counterpoint](Carocci 2008) – has given special attention to an analysis of Cirese’s essayConcezioni del mondo, filosofia spontanea e istinto di classe nelle “Osservazioni sul folklore” di Antonio Gramsci [World Views, Spontaneous Philosophy and Class Instinct in the “Observations On Folklore” by Antonio Gramsci](1970). Giulio Angioni’s and Pietro Clemente’s contributions – coming, in part, from an intellectual autobiography standpoint (they both have been Cirese’s students at first, and his colleagues later) – helped elucidate the method and the contents of Cirese’s work. They also dealt with Gramsci, in order to theoretically reconstruct the foundations of Italian folklore studies between the Sixties and the Seventies of XX Century. Baratta’s renewed reading, a part of which we here republish, together with Brigitte Wagner’s contribution (dedicated to the issue of the feasibility of translations of languages and cultures), give evidence to the prospect of a vitality of Cirese’s critical work outside the usual context of Italian folklore studies. Prospect and vitality that have been demonstrated by Cirese himself, who, during the 2008 seminar in Nuoro, was a protagonist of the dialogue with other scholars as well as with the public that intervened in the debate. He was a generous testimony of the large spectrum of his interests, mostly methodological, and he very carefully underlined, with respect to Gramsci, two aspect~<br>

Abstract: The ordinary reading for the compound 歴史眼 would be rekishigan, but Buddhist texts
usually prefer the reading gen for 眼（e.g., tengen 天眼)，and Murakami provides yomigana for
tins character (Murakami 1997，p. 9). Another way to render this expression would be "his-
torical perspective," taking it as a synonym for rekishikan 歴史観.I prefer to keep the literal
connotation.<br>

Abstract: The `puritan diary' has received attention from historians and literary critics with little exchange between the approaches. Placing the diary in the context of experimental Calvinist personal discipline reveals that the form emerged independently of the literature of practical divinity. Considering the practice as a `technology of the self' draws attention to the meanings of writing in a protestant context and encourages us to consider the cultural resources available to early modern protestants. Close reading of these texts suggests a greater degree of complexity than is often admitted and allows for a tension between different views of the salvific process. This tension between `open' and `closed' forms is helpful in understanding the religiosity of early modern protestants.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Abstract: The argument of Evans-Pritchard's classic The Nuer has been subject to conflicting interpretations. We examine these interpretations and then present a reading of the work that treats it as a whole. A key conclusion is that Evans-Pritchard distinguishes among three aspects of the "systems" he describes: (1) logical possibilities immanent in all forms of action, (2) cultural or local idioms in terms of which action is formulated and expressed, and (3) conditions and patterns of action. With this framework he develops, through an examination of the way interests in cattle are translated into political practices, an analysis in which the central theoretical problem is the relationship of structure to human agency. Our reading raises questions about the utility of standard classifications of theoretical orientations in social and cultural anthropology, particularly of the category of structural-functionalism, of which The Nuer is taken to be a central text.<br>

Abstract: At least since Aristotle, phronesis (practical wisdom) and poetics (making or creating) have been understood as essentially different activities, one moral the other (in itself) non-moral. Today, if anything, this distinction is sharpened by a Romantic association of poetics with inner subjective expression. Recent revivals of Aristotelian ethics sometimes allow for poetic dimensions of ethics, but these are still separated from practical wisdom per se. Through a fresh reading of phronesis in the French hermeneutical phenomenologist Paul Ricoeur, I argue that phronesis should be viewed as at least in part poetic at its very core. That is, phronesis deals with the fundamentally tragic human situation of moral incommensurability, and it responds to this by making or creating new moral meaning. Such a poetics of practical wisdom helps phronesis stand up to significant and important critiques made of it by a range of modernists and post-modernists, pointing a way forward for some important contemporary moral debates.<br>

Abstract: "ימי צקלג" (Days of Ziklag; published in 1958) is the greatest novel, both in scale and in quality, to emerge from what has come to be called "Dor Tashach" (The generation of 1948) or "Dor Ba'aretz" (The generation born in the Land [of Israel]). It is a huge novel, the longest in Hebrew. Some critics have considered it to be so massive, repetitive, and dense as to render it virtually unreadable, doomed to loom on the edge of the field of Hebrew literature like some immense, deserted, dusty old pyramid that nobody visits. This article presents a new reading of one aspect of this great work, that is, its relation to historical reality. This topic has been thoroughly discussed by Avi Ma'apil and Gershon Shaked. In their astute analyses of this aspect, both critics, in different ways, measure "Days of Ziklag" according to a time-honored, normative, regulatory model. My contention is that the model both critics use does not do justice to the novel for it is not able to capture the full depth of its pathos and its ethos, its ardor and its moral commitment, as well as many of its artistic charms. This article proposes an alternative model.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Working across several genres—literary fiction, popular music, scholarship, autobiography, political humor, and journalism—the essay seeks to delineate the economy of narration through which intensely disruptive experiences of exile and war, and competing ways of accounting for them, are internalized and expressed in the social production of self-narratives. تقوم المقالة بقراءة تأويلية للممارسات الثقافية ﺍﻟﺠﺰﺍﺋﺮﻳﺔ المعاصرة بوصفها ((تقنيات للعيش))٬ حيث تتحول ذكريات اجتماعية واسترجاعات جماعية للتجارب الفاجعة ٳلى أعمال أدبية وفنية بثغراتها الخاصة. وتتطرق المقالة ٳلى أجناس فنية ونقدية متعددة ـ الرواية الأدبية والموسيقى ﺍﻟﺮﺍﺋﺠﺔ والدراسات الأكاديمية والسير الذاتية والفكاهة ذات الطابع السياسي والصحافة ـ ساعية ٳلى ترسيم الاقتصاد الرمزي الذي عبره يتم احتواء تجارب الحرب والمنفى ﺍﻟﻤﻌﻄﱢﻠﺔ احتواءً نفسياً والتعبير عنها في نتاج يعكس الذات .<br>

Abstract: The article explores somatic metaphors related to explosion, outburst and eruption in diverse media. This inquiry lies in the intersection among philosophy, literary criticism and history of art and its conclusions are relevant to musi-cology. It is argued that there are various basic orientations, persuasions and biases underlying specific uses of metaphors of somatic eruption. The article endeavours to propose an alternative reading of body fluids as metaphoric sites of festive critique in subversively humorous discourse and art, which differs from more prevalent psychoanalytic interpretations. A text by Hélène Cixous, as well as visual material by Jenny Saville, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Nauman and Pieter Brueghel the Elder is scrutinized. The most appropriate musical example in this context is probably (especially the introduction to) the Háry János Suite by Zoltán Kodály.* By grouping male and female artists together, an underlying picaresque or subversively humorous, non-binary and geneticist match is suggested in their work. Yet, at the same time it is argued that female body fluids present women with metaphoric vantage points that facilitate understandings beyond the borders of patriarchal culture. /// Članak se temelji na većem istraživačkom projektu koji pokušava sagledati griješnu i komičnu ili feminističku likovnu umjetnost unutar šire pikareskne tradicije vizualne kulture. Termin 'pikareskno' (koji se rabi u širem smislu nego što je to uobičajeno u literarnim krugovima) služi da bi se opisalo specifične ideološke iskaze. Povratne pikareskne metafore pomno se ispituju zbog njihova potencijala da priopće takve iskaze, i to ne samo u umjetničkim djelima muških i ženskih umjetnika i u predstavljanjima muških i ženskih tijela, nego i medu umjetnicima i teoretičarima.

Article Title: Meta-Interpretation and Hypertext Fiction: A Critical Response<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i30204873<br>
Date: 2 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Gardner Colin<br>
Abstract: Traditional discourses upon literature have been predicated upon the ability to refer to a text that others may consult (Landow, 1994, p. 33). Texts that involve elements of feedback and nontrivial decision-making on the part of the reader (Aarseth, 1997, p. 1) therefore present a challenge to readers and critics alike. Since a persuasive case has been made against a critical method that sets out to "identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and territorial mastery" (Aarseth, p. 87), this paper proposes the use of readers in an empirically based approach to hypertext fiction. Meta-interpretation, a method that combines individual responses to a text, reading logs, screen recordings and limited qualitative/quantitative analysis, and critical interpretation is outlined. By analysing readers' responses it is possible to suggest both the ways that textual elements may have influenced or determined readers' choices and the ways that readers' choices "configure" the text. The method thus addresses Espen Aarseth's concerns and illuminates interesting features of interactive processes in fictional environments. The paper is divided into two parts: the first part sketches out meta-interpretation through consideration of the main problems confronting the literary critic; the second part describes reading research aimed at generating data for the literary critic.<br>

Issue: i30233773<br>
Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Leighton Taigen Dan<br>
Abstract: The Lotus Sutra is prominent among the many sources quoted by Dōgen in his writings, highlighting the Mahōyōna context of his teachings and worldview. In this paper I focus on Dōgen's use of the pivotal story in Lotus Sutra chapters fifteen and sixteen-the myriad bodhisattvas emerging from underground and the inconceivable life-span of the Buddha-to express his own worldview of earth, space, and time as enlightening forces. The shift in perspective expressed in this sutra story reflects a fundamental shift in East Asian Buddhist soteriology. A close reading of Dōgen's references to this story discloses how his hermeneutical play with its imagery of ground, space, and emptiness expresses immediate awakening, beyond stages of cultivation; he cites the inconceivable life-span story as an encouragement to present practice. The contrast between D6gen's response to the enduring Śākyamuni and that of his older contemporary Myōe is revealing.<br>

Publisher: Nanzan Institute of Religion and Culture<br>
Issue: i30233809<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Bathgate Michael<br>
Abstract: As a literature of exemplars, Pure Land sacred biography presents the reader with the ideals of a community as much as the events of individual lives. The models for the religious life advanced in sacred biographies, however, include not only the religious practices of their protagonists, but the discursive practices of their authors, as well. The work of biography, after all, is concerned not only with depicting characters and events, but with configuring both in a meaningful form. Through a comparative reading of ōjōden and myōkōninden, this study explores some of the ways in which changes in literary form encourage different perspectives on the nature of time, causality, and community in the constitution of the religious life. These exemplary orientations to the religious life, I suggest, are a fundamental aspect of the didactic functions of these texts, and thus of their contribution to the history of Pure Land religious imagination.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i30245669<br>
Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Glasner-Heled Galia<br>
Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Author(s): Ryan Marie Augusta<br>
Abstract: When religious orders are compared on differences in belief described as Pre-Vatican and Post-Vatican they also differ significantly in their preference for certain theologians and their preferences for types of works. Although age also explains this difference, even with age held constant the difference remains. Those with Post-Vatican beliefs express reading preferences and choice of works which affirm action to transform society as distinct from action to adjust to existing patterns.<br>

Article Title: If Meaning Is Constructed, What Is It Made from? Toward a Cultural Theory of Reading<br>
Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i368708<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yaroshevsky Peter<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the "transactional zone." The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)<br>

Abstract: Despite the abundance of psychological studies on trauma related ills of descendants of historical trauma, and the extensive scholarly work describing the memory politics of silenced traumatic pasts, there has yet to emerge a critical analysis of the constitutive practices of descendants of historical trauma. This article presents an ethnographic account of a support group for descendants of Holocaust survivors, proposing that the discursive frame of intergenerational transmission of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and support group based narrative practices allow descendants to fashion their sense of self as survivors of the distant traumatic past. The discursive frame of transmitted PTSD acts as both a mnemonic bridge to the past and a mechanism of identity making, as participants narratively reemplot their life stories as having been personally constituted by the distant past. A close ethnographic reading of on-site discursive practices points to how culture ferments to produce narratives, practices and ultimately carriers of memory to both sustain and revitalize historical grand narratives and the cultural scenarios they embed.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a reconsideration of how similes and metaphors function in the literary reading process, and examines the effects of their respective logical and syntactic forms, their truth-functional status, their pragmatic force, their creative power in language, and their roles as part of a cumulative textual process. Through a close reading of Alfred Jarry's "Les Jours et les nuits," it tests aspects of the accounts of metaphor offered by Cooper, Davidson, Kittay, Lecercle, Le Guern, and Ricœur, and thereby questions our criteria for the classification of simile and metaphor.<br>

Author(s): de Certeau François<br>
Abstract: "Aucune existence du présent sans présence du passé, et donc aucune ludicité du présent sans conscience du passé. Dans la vie du temps, le passé est à coup sûr la présence la plus lourde, donc possiblement la plus riche, celle en tout cas dont il faut à la fois se nourrir et se distinguer." La réflexion de Michel de Certeau sur l'histoire est parente de celle à laquelle invitait, en ces termes, Alphonse Dupront, le 22 février 1964. Et la fécondité qu'elle conserve, en notre temps si préoccupé des rapports entre histoire et mémoire, explique une actualité éditoriale dont François Dosse nous aide à apprécier l'importance. L'article vise à éclairer l'actualité de la pensée et de l'œuvre de Michel de Certeau, attestée par la réédition en 2002 de ses livres les plus importants. Sa définition de "l'opération historiographique" reste précieuse en ce qu'elle conçoit celle-ci comme le produit d'un lieu social déterminé, comme une pratique et une écriture. Il récuse avec Paul Ricœur la fausse alternative entre l'histoire-science et l'histoire-récit. Sa lecture de Freud aide à penser le lien entre histoire et mémoire, qu'elle entend protéger contre le ressassement du passé. Par delà son apport à une "anthropologie du croire", Michel de Certeau invite les historiens à assumer, dans la recherche de chemins à travers les temporalités, tout à la fois l'humilité et l'esprit braconnier. /// This article provides an update on the thinking and works of Michel de Certeau. A new edition of his most important books came out in 2002. His definition of a "historiographic operation" remains very useful as it considers this operation as the product of a defined social place, a practice and a style. Like Paul Ricœur, he rejects the false alternative between history as science and history as narrative. His reading of Freud helps to make the link between history and memory, this same memory that has to be protected against the regrets of the past. Beyond his contribution to an "anthropology of ~<br>

Author(s): Gunnemann Jon P.<br>
Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000941<br>
Date: 4 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Rees Geoffrey<br>
Abstract: Widely regarded as the most influential proponent of the truth of original sin in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr worked hard to excise any "literalistic" element from his interpretation of the doctrine. In his attempt to "correct" the Augustinian tradition on original sin by purging it of all "literalistic errors," however, Niebuhr assumed as his starting point the most characteristically modern objection to the doctrine: that birth is a thoroughly natural, animal, and morally meaningless event. As a result, Niebuhr unnecessarily constrained his vision of the dimensions of human freedom, and hence his description of the dynamic of anxiety and freedom that energizes sin. Through a careful reading of Reinhold Niebuhr's writings on original sin, in light of the truth that the end of human life is inseparable from its origins, a reappraisal and recovery of the meaningfulness of the assertion of original sin as a literal inheritance is possible. The result of such a reappraisal and recovery is an amplified insight into the existential anxiety that Niebuhr otherwise described so convincingly.<br>

Abstract: A comparison of Giuseppe Bagetti's landscape sketches, watercolours, oil paintings and engravings with contemporary maps and the existing landscape reveals that in the creation of Bagetti's landscapes, narrative played a role that differed in cartographic and artistic representations. The comparison also demonstrates that his images were powerful constructions that were more successful in reflecting a narrative of glorious conquest than was possible through cartography. This paper offers a critical examination of Bagetti's representations of Napoleon's northern Italian campaign, which he sketched and painted between 1802 and 1809. Bagetti's paintings were neither pacifist nor an expression of Piedmontese patriotism but instead were inspired by, and constructed according to, a narrative about the conquest that reflected the views of the French authorities. The narrative found expression in formal written instructions from the central cartographical office in the Dépôt de la guerre, Paris, in verbal and written instructions from Bagetti's immediate superior, Jean François Martinel, and in letters personally addressed to Bagetti from the officer commanding the Dépôt. It is clear from a careful reading of the correspondence and from a comparison of Bagetti's paintings with both the present landscape and maps made at the time that Bagetti's disputes with his supervisors revolved around protecting his artistic integrity and reputation rather than resisting the authority of a foreign regime. /// Une comparaison entre les dessins, aquarelles, peintures et gravures de paysages de Giuseppe Bagetti avec des cartes de son temps et les paysages actuels révèle que dans la création des paysages de Bagetti le récit ne joue pas le même rôle que dans les représentations cartographiques et artistiques.

Abstract: In this paper, I draw on the mutually implicated structures of tragedy and self-formation found in Hegel's use of Sophocles' Antigone in the Phenomenology. By emphasizing the apparent distinction between particular and universal in Hegel's reading of the tragedies in Antigone, I propose that a tragedy of action (which particularizes a universal) is inescapable for subjectivity understood as socially constituted and always already socially engaged. I consider universal/particular relations in three communities: Hegel's Greek polis, his community of conscience, and my reading of certain feminist communities. The position I propose establishes a ground from which to approach subjects, and implies that all subjects may be understood as the result of relations embodying potential tragedy. This speaks to contemporary concerns about marginalization, identity articulation, and relations of recognition.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>

Abstract: A filosofia prática de Kant, ou seja, o nuclear da sua ética, juntamente com o "primado da razão prática sobre a especulativa" e a "religião nos limites da simples razão", com seu acento no "mal radical", têm inegáveis afinidades com a - e em certos casos influxo da - tradição cristã. O próprio Kant terá em alguns momentos reconhecido isso mesmo. Segundo o autor do presente texto, subsistem, contudo, inegáveis divergências. O artigo, escrito a partir de uma declarada 'simpatia metódica, pretende precisar no possível o alcance de umas e de outras, fazendo sobre o tema um balanço positivo. O autor propõe ainda uma hipótese de leitura do Opus Postumum, reconhecendo aqui uma tentativa por parte de Kant no sentido de purificar o seu "teísmo moral" numa direcção que tão pouco é alheia a importantes intuições cristãs. /// Aim of the article is to show that the practical philosophy of Kant, or, in other terms, the core of his ethics, as is the case with the "primacy of the practical reason over the speculative one" and the "religion within the limits of pure reason", with its accent set upon the idea of "radical evil", have undeniable affinities with -and in certain cases influxes from - the Christian tradition. Kant himself seems to have recognized that much at certain moments. For the author of the article, however, there are a few divergences to be reckoned with. In fact, the article, which is clearly written from the standpoint of a declared methodic sympathy, does whatever is possible in order to determine the reach of the ones and of the others, but in the end concludes that the result is a positive one. The author also suggests a reading hypothesis for the Opus Postumum, acknowledging here an attempt on the part of Kant directed towards a purification of his "moral theism" in a direction that as such is no less close to some very important Christian intuitions.<br>

Author(s): Henriques Fernanda<br>
Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar sentido à afirmação feita, mais do que uma vez, por Paul Ricoeur, de que a sua filosofia poderia ser vista como um kantismo pós-hege-liano. Nesse contexto, o artigo procura abordar o pensar ricoeuriano mostrando de que modo ele se instaura e se desenvolve no horizonte kantiano de uma filosofia dos limites do saber. Essa abordagem é desenvolvida em dois momentos. O primeiro dirige-se à leitura que Paul Ricoeur faz da Crítica da Razão Pura de Kant. O segundo centrar-se-à em três momentos fulcrais da Filosofia de Paul Ricoeur - a definição do seu projecto Filosofia da Vontade, a figura própria da sua Hermenêutica e o filosofema inovação semântica - evidenciando em cada um deles a ressonância da herança kantiana. /// Aim of this article is to to explore the meaning of Paul Ricoeur's persistent characterization of his own work as a post-Hegelian Kantism. In view of this end, the article demonstrates that Ricoeur's thinking is at once rooted and developed within the horizon of Kant's critical philosophy of limits in regard to knowledge. This can be shown by first considering Ricoeur's reading of the first Critique, and then centering on three decisive moments of Ricoeur's philosophy, to wit, the formulation of the project developed in the Philosophy of Will, the shape of his theory of hermeneutics, and his notion of semantic innovation that can be conceived as a philosophema. The Kantian influence can be seen to resonate in all three instances.<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Article Title: The Narrative Ethics of Leopold's Sand County Almanac<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40014552<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Liszka James Jakób<br>
Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

Abstract: Cet article présente une lecture de l'histoire de la Palestine telle qu'elle est perçue par les historiens arabes. Il aborde l'évolution de cette histoire à travers les étapes marquantes de la construction identitaire et nationale du peuple palestinien. On propose, notamment, une analyse de l'historiographie arabe moderne de la Palestine dans le sens où elle est conçue en miroir de l'histoire israélienne et comme outil de revendication de l'appartenance d'un peuple à une terre. L'année 1948, caractérisant l'expulsion (Nakba) des Palestiniens de leur terre, est un tournant décisif dans l'écriture et l'appréhension de l'histoire palestinienne: elle représente l'année de départ mais également celle du retour vers la construction d'une identité nationale, territoriale et historique. /// This paper presents a new reading of the Palestinian history as perceived by the Arab historians. It tackles the evolution of the history throughout the significant stages of the nation and identity building of the Palestinian people, and proposes an analysis of the modern Arab historiography of Palestine conceived as a mirror to the Israeli one, and as a tool for the claim of the lost homeland. The year of 1948 designating the Palestinian expulsion (Nakba) remains the turning point for all the writings and represents at the same time, the year of departure and of return for the construction of the national, territorial and historical Palestinian identity.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an anthropological reading of mythical and historical texts aimed at exploring the dynamics by which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed and reconstructed. Using Dumont's ideas of hierarchy and Sahlins' work on cultural reproduction, the study presents a synchronie and diachronic analysis of the underlying themes and principles upon which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed. The opposition of visible/invisible is the common principle around which other principles or sets of oppositions are clustered. The study shows that archaic Egyptian cosmology underwent a transformation from a structure based on natural entities into socially significant cosmological system. The paper further elaborates the striking homology between the archaic social cosmology represented in Osirian mythology and Christianity in the early centuries of the Christian era.<br>

Abstract: Depuis la seconde moitié du xxe siècle, il s'opère un jeu de va-et-vient incessant entre le passé et le présent, entre la transcendance de la tradition ou sa rupture, en même temps qu'il se produit un phénomène d'échanges et de communications de diverses musiques du monde. De ce phénomène résultent aussi bien des chocs de culture, de savoirs que de pensées et de leur ré-interprétation ou transformation, sans oublier leur ré-appropriation par les uns et par les autres. Les musiques des uns et des autres -cultures du monde -, devenant alors le patrimoine de tous, se prêtent aux fantasmes et aux interprétations de ceux qui les reçoivent ou les perçoivent selon leur sensibilité, selon leurs affinités. C'est dans ce cadre que la musique elitiste contemporaine couvre actuellement une hétérogénéité de procédés et de formes, en ce qu'elle associe divers facteurs : écriture-oralité, mémoire collective, acquis culturel, juxtaposition ou enchevêtrement d'expressions musicales d'origines diverses (populaires, variétés, traditionnelles, savantes). Ceci appelle sa relecture à différents niveaux, par conséquent sa ré-interprétation, ainsi que l'examen approfondi de ses conditions historiques et socioculturelles de production. Pour amorcer cette nouvelle réflexion sur l'art musical elitiste contemporain, devenue actuellement plus qu'une nécessité, je propose l'expression World Music savante pour servir ici de béquille à une tentative de questionnement sur l'émergence et la consolidation d'une nouvelle identité culturelle ou tradition musicale elitiste contemporaine, celle cristallisant une réalité multiple et hétérogène. C'est aussi, pour moi, une manière de m'interroger sur la contemporanéité de la musique savante actuelle. Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been a ceaseless interplay between past and present, between transcendence of and break with tradition, together with a phenomenon of exchange and communication with diverse musics of the world, resulting in ~<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: The rationalist fantasy of the Enlightenment is the myth of the nonviolent origins of virtue, typically represented through the image of rational birth. This myth falters when Odoardo Galotti, invoking the second birth of reason, kills his daughter. This article examines Lessing's Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts-essentially a treatise on the phylogeny/ontogeny distinction-in terms of a recuperative rationalist gesture that continues to inform Freud's oedipal theory as well as Claude Lévy-Strauss's understanding of the "cerebral savage." These theories are not treated as methodological frameworks for reading Lessing but rather as evidence of the tanacity of Enlightenment desires, which are already problematized by texts like Emilia Galotti.<br>

Author(s): HAYWARD EVA<br>
Abstract: In When Species Meet (2008) Donna Haraway proposes that creatures' identities and affinities emerge through their encounters, their relationships. Following Haraway's lead, I attend to how different species sense and apprehend one another, leaving impressions—concrescences of perceptual data, or texture. This essay reports on fieldwork alongside marine biologists and with a population of cup corals (B. elegans) housed at the Long Marine Laboratory, Santa Cruz, California. While I assisted researchers who were studying metabolic rates and reproductive strategies in coral communities, these cup corals simultaneously taught me that being and sensing are inextricably enfolded. We were variously situated—corals generating generations, me interpretations. We met through a material-semiotic apparatus I call "fingeryeyes." As an act of sensuous manifesting, fingeryeyes offers a queer reading of how making sense and sensual meaning are produced through determinable and permeable species boundaries.<br>

Issue: i40044266<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Simas-Almeida Leonor<br>
Abstract: Since its first publication, A Costa dos Murmúrios has attracted the critics' attention to the paradox of the explicit denial of its own authority over the historical facts that are part of the narration and its implicit, if qualified, affirmation of the same authority. This article also focuses on the sort of subliminal tension but from the angle of the literary construction of emotions, rather than examining either the poetics of historiographic metafiction or the role of memory in the narration of the past. Analyzing various aspects of A Costa dos Murmúrios (such as the predominant points of view, the structure of the narrative, the disintegration of the characters' identities, the emotional impact of a few vivid scences, the personalization of national events), a case is made for reading this novel as an intimate chronicle of historical facts.<br>

Abstract: L'auteure présente un outil d'exploration des situations sociales : l'arrêt sur image. Elle revient sur ses diverses contraintes techniques et méthodologiques et démontre leur intérêt au sein d'une enquête inspirée par la sociologie de l'action. C'est en tenant compte de la temporalité des actions humaines que l'image semble pouvoir évoluer d'un rôle d'illustration à celui d'outil d'analyse. En passant indifféremment d'image animée à image statique, l'enregistrement vidéo permet un choix de séquences filmées et une lecture multiple des contextes observés. Il aide à suivre finement les activités des acteurs, et à mettre en évidence la différence entre les normes du groupe et celles de l'individu. The author présents a tool for explorating social situations : freezing on the frame. She evokes its various technical and methodological limits and shows its interest for a survey inspired by action sociology. By taking into account the temporality of human actions the image can be more than illustrative and become an analysis tool. By passing indiscriminately from an animated image to a static one video recording permits a sélection of filmed séquences and a multiple reading of the observed contexts. It helps to follow minutely the actors' activities and to show the différence between group norms and individual norms. Die Autorin stellt ein Beobachtungsmittel der sozialen Lagen dar : das Standbild. Sie beschreibt seine verschiedenen technischen und methodologischen Beschränkungen und zeigt sein Interesse für eine von der Handlungssoziologie inspirierten Erhebung. Durch die Berücksichtigung der Zeitlichkeit der Menschenhandlungen ist das Bild mehr als illustrativ und kann zum Analysemittel werden. Beim unterschiedslosen Übergehen von einem belebten zu einem statischen Bild bietet die Videoaufnahme eine Auswahl von gefilmten Bildfolgen und ein vielfaches Lesen der beobachteten Kontexten. Sie hilft dazu, den Unterschied zwischen Gruppennormen und individualen Normen hervorzuh~<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048276<br>
Date: 9 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Keck Frédéric<br>
Abstract: En lisant l'œuvre de Lévy-Bruhl à travers le problème de la causalité mentale, on voit que le concept de participation, emprunté à la philosophie de Malebranche, lui permet de dépasser l'opposition entre deux conceptions : — d'une part, la « causalité naturelle » , empruntée à Tylor et à Tassociationnisme britannique, qui explique les opérations magiques par des erreurs intellectuelles ; — d'autre part, la « causalité sociale » , élaborée par Durkheim et la sociologie française, qui explique les phénomènes moraux et religieux par l'intervention de la « société » comme sujet collectif. Le concept de participation désigne un mode de causalité qui opère au niveau de l'expérience naturelle sans lui ajouter un niveau surnaturel et proprement social : « Cette analyse est comparable à celle de l'imagination chez Bergson et éclaire la réception ambivalente de Lévy-Bruhl dans la phénoménologie et dans le structuralisme. » Reading Lévy-Bruhl's work through the topic of mental causality, one sees that the concept of participation – borrowed from Malebranche's philosophy – enables him to overpass the opposition between two conceptions : — on the one hand, « natural causality », borrowed from Tylor and British associationnism, which accounts for magical operations through intellectual mistakes, and — on the other hand, « social causality », elaborated by Durkheim and French sociology, which accounts for moral and religious events through the intervention of society as a collective subject. The concept of participation refers to a mode of causality which works on the level of natural experience without adding to it a supernatural and specifically social level: « This analysis can be compared to that of imagination by Bergson, and throws a light on the ambivalent reception of Lévy-Bruhl by phenomenology and structuralism. »<br>

Abstract: Windelband, réputé comme chef de l'école néokantienne de Bade, s'oppose comme Bergson au relativisme et au positivisme. Pour lui, comprendre Kant, c'est le dépasser, et ce, dans la direction de Hegel ; lire Bergson, c'est retrouver le sens de l'événement dans une métaphysique de l'irrépétable, qui, en montrant l'insuffisance du criticisme, ouvre la porte aux sciences historiques. Cela est l'interprétation positive de Bergson. Mais la critique est qu'il faut séparer totalement la psychologie de la philosophie, contrairement à la tradition philosophique française, encore observée par Bergson. Mais le volontarisme bergsonien apparaît comme représentatif de l'esprit de la philosophie du tournant du XIXe au XXe siècle. Mieux encore, avec Bergson, la philosophie retrouve l'ambition (hégélienne) d'être une vision globale du monde. Windelband, well-known for being the leader of the Neo-Kantian School of Bade, together with Bergson, is opposed to both relativism and positivism. According to him, understanding Kant means going further than the latter and, more, in Hegel's direction. Reading Bergson means finding again the meaning of event within metaphysics of what may not be repeated which, by showing the insufficiency of criticism, opens a new way towards historical sciences. Such is the positivie interpretation of Bergson. But the criticism is such as one should imperatively separate psychology from philosophy, contrary to the French philosophical tradition, still observed by Bergson. But Bergsonian voluntarism appears as some kind of representative of the spirit of philosophy at the turn of the 19th-20th century. Better further, with Bergson philosophy recaptures its (Hegelian) ambition to become a global vision of the world.<br>

Abstract: Quatre recueils récents comportant des contributions de philosophes allemands et américains permettent de préciser et discuter les grandes questions soulevées aujourd'hui par diverses traditions de lecture de Hegel, en particulier, la question d'une lecture morale de la « reconnaissance » dans la Phénoménologie de l'esprit, la théorie de la connaissance, le statut de la beauté. Four recent collections offering contributions by German and American philoso­phers allow us to discuss with greater precision the major questions raised today by different traditions of reading Hegel, notably in regard to the question of a moral reading of the concept of "recognition" in the Phenomenology of the mind, the theory of knowledge, the status of beauty.<br>

Author(s): Claviez Thomas<br>
Abstract: From a Western perspective, a mythic worldview has traditionally been considered not only as "unscientific" and less effective than a scientific approach; it has also usually been judged morally questionable, if not "immoral." The essay addresses the ethics of myth through a reading of N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawn, and tries to unwrap the differences and misunderstandings that have barred an ethical approach to myth. In doing so, it argues for the acknowledgment of the openness of a work of literature that should not be reduced to an ethnic-political reading informed by identity politics.<br>

Author(s): Daunay Bertrand<br>
Abstract: Depuis que la didactique du français s'est constituée comme champ de recherche, la question de l'enseignement de la littérature a toujours été centrale, même si l'approche didactique de la littérature apparaît davantage comme un espace de questions que comme un lieu de construction d'une théorie cohérente de la littérature, de son enseignement et de son apprentissage. Concernant l'enseignement de la littérature, la didactique du français est essentiellement un champ de discussions théoriques, qui portent aussi bien sur le statut des objets enseignables et sur les conditions de leur enseignabilité que sur la sélection des outils théoriques permettant l'approche de ces objets. Si, aux fondements de la didactique de la littérature, c'est la contestation de l'enseignement traditionnel qui domine, sur des postulats théoriques à forte teneur idéologique, de nombreuses recherches descriptives ont interrogé aussi bien la notion de littérature que les pratiques de lecture des élèves comme les pratiques effectives d'enseignement de la littérature. Au cœur des recherches didactiques se place la question de la sélection des savoirs et des pratiques (lecture et écriture notamment) susceptibles de devenir objets d'enseignement et d'apprentissage, à tous les niveaux du cursus scolaire. Since the didactics of French formed a research field, the question of teaching literature has constantly been crucial, even if the didactical approach of literature seems more like a forum to ask questions, rather than a place where a coherent theory on literature, its teaching and learning is being developed. As for teaching literature, the didactics of French is mainly an area of theoretical discussion as much about the status of objects to be taught and the conditions on which they can be taught as how to select theoretical tools to approach those objects. If, of all the founding elements of didactics of literature, objecting to traditional teaching is the main element based on theoretical postu~<br>

Abstract: O artigo tem por objectivo mostrar até que ponto o princípio de subjectividade presente na Escola Austríaca de Economia se revela fundamentado na tradição fenomenològica de Edmund Husserl e no seu pensamento acerca da constituição intersubjectiva do mundo da vida. Nesse sentido, o autor propõe uma hermenêutica realista, e não relativista, posicionando-se em função de um projecto mais global de fundamentar na hermenêutica algumas das principais posições da Escola Austríaca de Economia, pelo que o artigo propõe significativas pistas para uma releitura não só da praxeologia de Ludwig von Mises e da ordem espontânea de que fala Friedrich von Hayek, mas também da noção de middle ground proposta por Israel Kirzner e, não menos, de toda a temática relacionada com a empresarialidade. Por outro lado, posicionando-se numa perspectiva de superação da dialéctica entre teoria e história, entre "a priori" e "a posteriori", o artigo representa também uma chamada de atenção para a importância que deveria ter o estudo do pensamento de Edmund Husserl no âmbito das Ciências Sociais. This article aims in the first place at demonstrating how Edmund Husserl's idea of the intersubjective constitution of the life-world represents an appropriate explanation of the principle of subjectivity inherent to the theorizing of the Austrian School of Economics. In order to do this, the author proposes a realistic and non-relativistic view of hermeneutics, whereby his goal is precisely to demonstrate how much the Austrian School of Economics is grounded in hermeneutics. In this sense, the article suggests a new reading of Ludwig von Mises's praxeology, of Friedrich von Hayek's theory of the spontaneous order and a reinterpretation of Israel Kirzner's middle ground position and the corresponding theory of alertness. Positioning itself beyond the discussion between theory and history, or the debate if the prevalence should belong to the "a priori" or to the "a posteriori", the article suggests that Hus~<br>

Abstract: Richard Rorty uses Nietzsche to show that people need to create themselves because there is no foundationalist language which they can establish as an anchor. Although this perspective is Nietzschean, it is not Jamesian, and so Rorty misappropriates James when he conflates James and Nietzsche as like-minded progenitors of the mythologizing of a privileged vocabulary. This essay evaluates Rorty's reading of James by considering whether truth in Rorty's textualist sense can abide by the stream of thought. Although James does mythologize privileged vocabularies, he believes that words need to reflect the world more accurately (something Rorty would never say) by abiding by the flux of experience. As such, James recognizes the value that old words have as tools. Whereas Rorty shows disdain for old words, James shows us the cash value those words have in helping us to do anything from paying our bills to constructing more practical and effective theories.<br>

Author(s): WRÓBEL SZYMON<br>
Abstract: The title of the essay refers to the famous statement in Foucaults introduction to his History of Madness where he writes that "we have to do justice to Freud". The problem, however, is that Foucault's philosophy does not seem to do justice to Freud. Foucault's use of Freud is ambiguous: sometimes he uses him for purely instrumental purposes (when reconstructing the history of madness and sexuality), but sometimes—for anthropological purposes signaling Freud's role in redefining our common humanity and particularly our relation to language, life and work. The author confronts Foucault's ambiguous reading of Freud with the equally ambiguous reading of Foucault by Derrida. Derrida discusses Foucault twice. Once in the essay Cogito and The History of Madness in which Derrida takes on Foucault's understanding of Descartes and his role in the exclusion of madness from the realm of reason. The second time—in his essay To Do Justice to Freud. Here Derrida disagrees with Foucault whether Freud managed to reestablish the body's communication with reason which Descartes destroyed.<br>

Article Title: Class, Culture and the 'Predicaments of Masculine Domination': Encountering Pierre Bourdieu<br>
Publisher: Carfax Publishing Co.<br>
Issue: i384398<br>
Date: 9 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Zerilli Jo-Anne<br>
Abstract: This paper seeks to outline and evaluate Pierre Bourdieu's work as it has appeared most recently in feminist studies and the field of gender and education. In particular, it suggests ways in which Bourdieu's theoretical insights could be seen to more effectively contribute to cutting edge debates in both social theory and feminist thought regarding concepts such as agency, identity and domination. It also argues that a more creative and empirical engagement with the recent work of Bourdieu, alongside an interdisciplinary reading of more recent cultural and social theories of power, would be a fruitful way forward in advancing a feminist sociology of education. In the present historical moment and against the tide of postmodern and post-structuralist feminist accounts, Bourdieu is often read as a determinist who has little to offer contemporary feminist debates or who argues that masculine domination is too tightly woven to social practices of a given field. In short, this paper argues that such a view is not only a misreading of Bourdieu's work on fundamental theoretical grounds, but fails to acknowledge the ways in which his more recent work on masculinity addresses both the cultural and social conditions underlying contemporary forms of symbolic domination. In short, the paper argues that Bourdieu's theory offers an analytical breadth and range beyond the scope of anything that a normative, liberal account of masculine domination could provide. Yet, in drawing from such diversity, Bourdieu's oeuvre is able to resist incomprehensibility. It stands as a highly focused, realistic and generative attempt (McNay, 1999; McLeod, 2004) to chart the problems of subordination, differentiation and hierarchy, and to expose the possibilities, as well as the limits, of gendered self-hood.<br>

Abstract: L'univers médiatique du surf contemporain est peuplé de créatures de rêve. Sur les pages des magazines spécialisés, elles accompagnent de leurs courbes voluptueuses les prouesses des surfeurs et les produits du surfwear, donnant à la lecture sportive une touche d'érotisme. Ces jeunes femmes à la divine plastique, qui font aussi partie de la réalité des plages, sont appelées beachgirls. La plus sexy d'entre elles est la « Reef Girl » , pin-up « exotique » sans visage qui a contribué au succès de la marque de tongs Reef. Cet article se propose d'esquisser le portrait de cette figure féminine de la surf culture, et de retracer son parcours médiatique -narratif-avant sa récente disparition suite à l'essor de la mixité au sein d'une pratique physique à dominante masculine. The media world of contemporary surfis full of bombshells. On the pages of magazines, their voluptous curves escort the beautiful performances of surfers together with surfwear products, adding an erotic touch to the sports reading. These young women with wonderful bodies, — a part of the beach's scene-, are called "beachgirls". The sexiest of them is the "Reef Girl", an "exotic" pinup without any face who has contributed to the success of the flip-flop brand Reef. This article outlines the portrait of this feminine figure of surf culture ; it describes its presence in media and narrative discourses before it faded away, when the formerly made dominated sport opened to women. Die Welt des Surfens ist bevölkert von Traumkörpern. Den Fachzeitschriften verleihen ihre heldenhaften Körper und die Surfwear, die sie präsentieren, einen Hauch von Erotik. Die jungen Frauen und ihre göttlichen Körper, die ebenfalls zum Inventar der Strände gehören, heißen „ Beachgirls". Die sexieste unter ihnen ist das sogenannte Reef Girl, eine „exotisches" Pin-up Mädchen, das zum Erfolg der Badeschuh-Marke Reef beigetragen hat.

Publisher: University of Tulsa<br>
Issue: i40063225<br>
Date: 10 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Bostic Heidi<br>
Abstract: Françoise de Graffigny's mid-eighteenth-century play Phaza features a main character who is unknowingly crossed dressed as male. The text provides a rich starting point for exploring questions of gender identity and performance. This article situates Phaza within the fairy-tale tradition in which women authors played a major role. Its analysis draws upon philosophies of narrative identity and theories of gender to show that identity comprises both permanence and performance. Reading Graffigny can make an important difference in our understanding of gender, authorship, and relations between the sexes in Enlightenment France. Phaza's masquerade sheds light on the ways in which women authors of the era approached and assumed various gender identities. Eighteenth-century texts like Phaza reveal a lineage of ideas that continue to influence feminist thought today and will do so in the future.<br>

Abstract: A fierce opponent of the historicist approach to literature that dominated French academe during his lifetime, the essayist and poet Charles Péguy (1873–1914) would theorize an alternative literary method that through the act of faithful and participatory reading could transcend the limitations of historicism. Outlined in his dialogue with History, Clio, Péguy's vision of the literary act is that of an intersubjective operation of mutual understanding between reader and author, in which the living relevance of literary works extends beyond their narrow historical origins; a conception that prefigures the formalist and hermeneutic literary approaches that will arise decades later.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40073035<br>
Date: 5 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): DIETZ MARY G.<br>
Abstract: A ristotle lived during a period of unprecedented imperial expansionism initiated by the kings of Macedon, but most contemporary political theorists confine his political theorizing to the classical Greek city-state. For many, Aristotle's thought exhibits a parochial Hellenocentric "binary logic" that privileges Greeks over non-Greeks and betrays a xenophobic suspicion of aliens and foreigners. In response to these standard "polis-centric" views, I conjure a different perceptual field—"between polis and empire"—within which to interpret Aristotle's Politics. Both theorist and text appear deeply attentive to making present immediate things "coming to be and passing away" in the Hellenic world. Moreover, "between polis and empire," we can see the Politics actually disturbing various hegemonic Greek binary oppositions (Greek/barbarian; citizen/alien; center/periphery), not reinforcing them. Understanding Politics within the context of the transience of the polis invites a new way of reading Aristotle while at the same time providing new possibilities for theorizing problems of postnational citizenship, transnational politics, and empire.<br>

Abstract: This paper is about the analysis of the written production of argumentative discourse. Thanks to the technique of collective writing it is possible to observe the process of discourse production. Declarative, strategic and procedural abilities of two non native adults are successively analyzed and compared periodically to those of two young native speakers. This study focuses on only two levels : global and interphrasal organisation of discourse. The organisation of debates in class so as to bring students to build argumentative concepts and help them in their approach of texts (reading and writing) shows the limits of a didactic scheme which relies on oral language practice for the elaboration of written texts.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Abstract: The word "end" was not written by Hugo at the end of Toilers of the Sea; this is because his ending, within the precise delimitations suggested here, does not need it, and might even be spoilt by the word. Indeed, it leads narrative desire and characters to an end which, as in music, resonates with the past reading — while at the same time it metaphorises both the act of writing and the act of reading as it comes to its last words.<br>

Abstract: The issue is the manner in which the reading of literature can constitute an everyday existential resource, without construing this use of reading in an excessively instrumental manner. The key resides in the formal characters rendering a literary element notable, memorable, and/or quotable, both privately and collectively, inasmuch as the orientation of these elements is the becoming of the reader(s), not their past. La question est celle de la façon dont la littérature peut représenter une ressource dans la vie quotidienne, sans concevoir un tel usage de la lecture littéraire comme purement instrumental. Un tel usage de la lecture se trouve lorsque les caractéristiques formelles qui rendent, individuellement ou collectivement, notable, mémorable ou citable tel ou tel passage littéraire s'accompagnent d'une orientation vers l'avenir du lecteur, et non vers la rétrospection.<br>

Abstract: History is a passage from an « I-truth » to a « He-truth » through an « Ustruth » where the nature of who resides in the us, and the capacity for it to an assumed « We-truth », determines the transformation into a « He-truth » - with the pitfall that an « I-truth » can disguise as a « He-truth » by restricting its « Us » aspects, and anyway be read as such. Reading Learning Each Other's Historical Narrative through the prism of Greek history and political thought enables it to be seen as a step in the direction of the constitution of a « we » encompassing what are as yet two « us »'s... L'histoire est un passage d'un « Je-vrai » à un « Il-vrai » au travers d'un « On-vrai » , où la question de qui se tient derrière ce « on » et de sa capacité à assumer un « nous » détermine le passage au « Il-vrai » -avec le risque qu'un « Je-vrai » peut se déguiser en « Il-vrai » en restreignant l'accès au « On », et en tout cas peut toujours être lu ainsi. La lecture d'Histoire de l'autre au moyen du filtre de l'histoire et de la pensée politique grecques permet de le voir comme une étape dans la construction d'un « nous » rassemblant ce qui ne sont pour le moment que deux « on »...<br>

Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a critical reappraisal of Abba Bahrey's Zenahu leGalla, the controversial 16th century text. Some scholars criticize it as harbouring anti-Oromo sentiments while others praise it as an important source on the organization of Oromo society The paper argues that, while Zenahu leGalla does provide useful historical information on the Oromo, its lasting value lies elsewhere: in the critical reflection it initiates on the issues of power, freedom, social change, violence, and the public use of reason. To unpack these issues, occluded by current interpretations of Zenahu leGalla, the paper undertakes a critical hermeneutical reading of the text. The reading shows that Bahrey's text incubates emancipatory surplus meanings that transcend his epoch and speak to the concerns of contemporary Ethiopia. In the concluding sections, the paper discusses the issues of democracy and development in light of these surplus meanings.<br>

Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a symptomatic reading of the writings of a fifteenth century heretical movement—the Dekike Estifanos—to throw light on the modernization predicament of twenty–first century Ethiopia. Based on the assumption that all serious thinking about a society needs to be mediated by its intellectual tradition, the paper enucleates critiques of power, institutions and knowledge that are immanent in the teachings of the Dekike Estifanos and that throw a new light on how Ethiopians could approach the tasks they face in the twenty-first century. It shows that such a critical dialogue with Ethiopia's intellectual traditions discloses questions, ideas and ideals that could provide historically-rooted intellectual resources for developing an Ethiopian critical theory capable of illuminating the possible routes to a modernization productive of freedom, equality, justice, and prosperity.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40084882<br>
Date: 4 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mitchell Joshua<br>
Abstract: Because Hobbes is understood to be a proto-liberal thinker, a great deal hinges on how we understand his writings. Does he contribute to the development of a purely secular political self-understanding, as many liberals today claim? And, by extension, does that mean that liberal thought today best stands on a purely secular foundation? What, then, should we make of the extensive theological speculation throughout his Leviathan! Here, I argue that to reconcile the seemingly purely secular claims in Leviathan with the obviously religious claims found there we must move beyond reading him in terms of what I here call 'the fable of liberalism', and comprehend Leviathan as a whole in terms of Reformation era debates between Protestants and Roman Catholics about the limits and purview of reason. Understood in that way we see his claims about 'reason' in a new and important light. Rather than being an inevitable development that comes to supercede honour and glory, as the fable of liberalism suggests, 'reason' is seen to have an historically contingent character, whose parameters are established by wagers about the meaning of religious experience.<br>

Author(s): Greisch Jean<br>
Abstract: La problématique de la reconnaissance que Ricoeur développe dans son ultime ouvrage n'est pas seulement un nouveau chantier philosophique qu'il ouvre à ses lecteurs. Une lecture rétrospective de son oeuvre découvre que cette thématique est le dernier fruit de l'herméneutique des symboles développée dans les années 60 et de l'herméneutique du soi exposée dans Soi-même comme un autre. Une interprétation systématique des trois études du Parcours de la reconnaissance montre quel sens la formule : « Je me suis reconnu philosophe » revêtirait dans la bouche de Ricœur. The topic of recognition that Ricoeur develops in his final work does not only open a whole new field of inquiry for his readers. A retrospective reading of his work discovers that this theme is the last fruit of the hermeneutics of symbols developped during the 1960s and of the hermeneutics of the self examined in Oneself as Another. A systemic interpretation of the three studies included in Parcours de la reconnaissance shows the meaning that the phrase « I recognized myself as a philosopher » would take on according to Ricœur.<br>

Abstract: La présente étude se consacre à un examen du concept de la mémoire collective en s'interrogeant sur l'interprétation que Paul Ricœur propose de ce concept dans son ouvrage La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. L'auteur présente une lecture critique de l'interprétation de la mémoire collective chez Ricœur là ou Ricœur tente de comprendre ce phénomène par analogie avec la mémoire personnelle et risque, selon cette lecture, d'occulter les dimensions de la mémoire collective qui échappent à un tel rapport analogique. L'auteur tente alors de dépasser le cadre de cette analogie par une analyse des sources symboliques et métapersonnelles de la mémoire collective. This study examines the concept of collective memory through an investigation of Paul Ricœur's interpretation of this concept in his work, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. In presenting a critical reading of the analogy Ricoeur establishes between collective and personal memory, the author argues that this analogy risks excluding those dimensions of collective memory which cannot be comprehended through such an analogy. The attempt is then made to surmount this difficulty through an analysis of collective memory in relation to its symbolic and metapersonal sources.<br>

Abstract: El artículo propone una lectura de la novela de Antonio Gil, Cosa mentale (1994), como construcción artificiosa del pasado a través de la puesta en juego de los procedimientos pictóricos aplicados a la poesía. El dictum horaciano ut pictura poiesis será revisado a partir del registro delirante y experimental de una novela que indaga en las maneras de configurar el pasado histórico recurriendo a temporalidades alternativas al tiempo de la modernidad histórica. De esta manera, según un criterio analógico, es posible identificar retóricas de la imagen y de la representación a nivel narrativo, en correspondencia con la narratividad pictórica. Finalmente, se entrega una interpretación sobre la perspectiva transhistórica del narrador que permitiría entender las anacronías narrativas como rupturas entre tiempo de la modernidad y tiempo del mito. This article proposes a reading of the Antonio Gil's novel, Cosamentale (1994), as an artificial construction of the past through the pictorial procedures applied to poetry. Horatio's dictum ut pictura poiesis will be revised on the basis of this delirious and experimental novel that explores a ways to configure the historic past resorting to alternatives temporalities in respect of historical modernity time. In this way, according to an analogical criterion, we identified rhetorics of the image and the representation in the narrative level, in correspondence with the pictorial narrative. Finally, we give an interpretation about the transhistoric perspective of the narrator that explains narrative anachronisms between the time of modernity and the time of the myth.<br>

Abstract: Attempting a Christ-oriented reading of the Old Testament is a challenge which invites objections and obstacles. What is the degree of legitimacy or of necessity which the New Testament (the Gospels and Acts) provides for such a reading? We are concerned with those texts which set forth the principle itself rather than with individual citations; such a reading appears as inseparable from the foundations of the faith. Other texts are illuminating for us with regard to the way of carrying this out. This article presents the first lines of a response, by means of a hermeneutical conversion. It presupposes that one cannot distance oneself from the literal meaning and from its spiritual and theological content.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on a close reading of Rey Ventura's autobiographical narrative of his experience as an illegal migrant worker in Japan in order to unsettle the dominant paradigm of the overseas Filipino worker as hero(ine) and martyr. It examines the ways in which both the Philippine and Japanese states have acted as apparatuses of labor capture; the various discourses of nationness which inform the political construction of the OFW as "labor," "foreign," "illegal" and "depoliticized"; and the strategies of survival used by OFWs to negotiate with, and make claims on, the labor-sending and -receiving states.<br>

Abstract: The study deals with the problem of Stephen Greenblatt's approaches to an analysis of literary work. The author analyzes Greenblatt's concepts of interpretation of literary work and notices the dangerous results of such interpretations in which literary work as a specifical esthetical object is dissolved in the wide frame of cultural history. On the other hand, he tries to represent how Greenblatt's looking for historical context via permanent negotiation with the texts and reading of textual traces can enriches the work of literary historian.<br>

Author(s): Bílek Petr A.<br>
Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Abstract: In the late twentieth century two conceptions of text in a literary work followed from the original distinction between Sinn (smysl, sense) and Bedeutung (význam, reference), which was made by Gottlob Frege in 1892 - namely, those of Wolfgang Iser and Paul Ricoeur. For us, they are interesting for their direct or indirect affinity to Czech Structuralism. The article presents a detailed comparison of the two conceptions: Iser's 'act of reading', culminating in the 'play of the text', and Ricoeur's proposal of 'productive reference', which heads towards the references (Bedeutungen) of a world that is irmagined, without actually being, and announces itself through the creative power of language. The article concludes by returning to the question of the game and reference in the work of Iser and Eugene Fink. Play and art guard the vitality of sense.<br>

Author(s): Trávníček Jiří<br>
Abstract: Re-reading Plato’s Ion as the first text in the hermeneutics tradition, the author finds two main streams. The first, based on reflection (rationality, logic, knowledge) stems from ocrates; the second, consisting in an affective approach (myth, art), stems from Ion. Both Socrates and Ion delimit this field of hermeneutics (legein peri or ‘speaking abouť) staying beyond its frontiers. Next, the author exploits the Socrates: Ion binary in order to interpret some key figures, trends, and schools within the whole tradition (rabbis, St Augustine, Pietism, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Dilthey, explication de texte, Heidegger, Gadamer, Peter Szondi, the Nitra School, and Ricoeur). Writers tend towards either the Socratic (explication de texte) or lonic wing (Nietzsche). There are, however, also writers who attempted to find the middle ground, a position offering both reflexion and intuition (Schleiermacher, Gadamer, and Ricoeur). The author concludes that the main challenge issuing from his interpretation is to remain close to a text, and resist any temptation to go beyond it.<br>

Abstract: This essay returns to the Dixie Chicks "incident" in order to reexamine the backlash against them. Their critics claim that patriotism and their contract with country music are at stake; I argue that the backlash is old-fashioned misogyny. My examination considers the concepts of prayer, patriotism, and the American Pledge of Allegiance. These words, though used loosely, are part of the central criticism of the Dixie Chicks actions. To accomplish my task, I turn, on the one hand, to Levinas and Heschel, and on the other to Hegel's reading of Antigone.<br>

Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: A survey of recent books on Reader-Response, broadly defined as any literary theory that investigates the process of reading. This includes not only books by Norman Holland, Stanley Fish, and Wolfgang Iser, long regarded as central figures in the area of Reader-Response, but also discussions of the contribution to this area made by Jacques Derrida and Mikhail Bakhtin. A widespread reaction is observed against the impersonality of much literary theory and the dangers of reducing reading to a science, but alternative models that stress the therapeutic, self-enhancing, or playful elements in reading are also exposed to critical analysis.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to examine and go beyond the Freudian, psychoanalytical approach to the work of art. The author specifically considers the case of the musical work through the notion of 'repetition', a notion upon which the relationship of the unconscious with time is founded. After analyzing the ambiguity of the Freudian stance, he points out Freud's error regarding the meaning that can be attributed to repetition: according to Freud, repetition is only a negative phenomenon, which indicates the failure of desire fulfillment. The author instead posits that repetition, basic to all music, is the fundamental structure of a time-based art that is closely connected with the imaginary and the unconscious. Repetition and variation are the two fundamental aspects of the organization of time for the human psyche. The most ancient figure of repetition-variation in the unconscious is that of the echo. The author analyzes this notion through the concepts of 'sound-container of the Self' and 'transitional time' as defined by Anzieu and Winnicott. Several musical examples show how this figure lies at the root of the first experiences of musical time in Western culture. The echo can be considered as the basis of other musico-temporal figures such as 'dead time', the 'empty container', and the 'pseudo-connection'. These are the figures that constitute the temporal narrative of late nineteenth-century music, and of the passage to contemporary music, its fundamental discontinuity and non-linearity. Finally, the author returns to the initial topic: a psychoanalysis of a musical work can only be a psychoanalytic reading of the figures of its creation, it cannot be a psychoanalysis of the creating artist. More generally, what the work designates remains inaccessible - or rather, cannot be perceived except in a lack that returns us to the listener's emptiness. The work finds its place in the listener, bringing along an absence, a non-existence which is projected outwards, whic~<br>

Author(s): LEBRUN Jocelyne<br>
Abstract: Afin de justifier l'élaboration et l'usage d'une phénoménologie de l'imagination poétique, on montrera comment le langage poétique permet selon le mot de P. Ricoeur « d'articuler une expérience fictive » en dégageant l'« illusion » qui s'attache à la lecture de l'objet poétique. Avec Bachelard on verra comment l'image poétique apparaît comme une aurore de parole et un être nouveau. On verra comment le phénoménologue n'oublie jamais que l'expérience poétique situe le poème dans « le pays de la vérité » et s'efforce de le saisir comme essence, Wesenschau. Mais comme d'autre part une illusion fondamentale s'attache à la lecture de l'œuvre poétique, on évoquera la pensée de Nietzsche qui se déploie dans le jeu de l'illusion et de la vérité. L'artiste est cet illusionniste sublime qui nous fait sentir comme réel le monde des phénomènes. On terminera par une définition du poète comme celui qui nomme et par sa nomination fait être, fait l'Être apparaissant et transparent. To justify a phenomenology of poetic imagination we show how through poetical language a fictitious experience can be articulated, as says P. Ricoeur, by sifting out the « illusion » which pertains to the reading of the poetical object. According to Bachelard poetical image appears as a dawn of words and a new being. The phenomenologist never forgets that according to poetical experience a poem dwells in the « land of truth » and should be grasped as an essence, « Wesenschau ». But, as a fundamental illusion clings to the reading of a poetical work, we shall remember Nietzsche whose thought dwells in the play of illusion and truth. Thanks to the artist as a sublime conjurer we feel real the world of phenomena. To end, a poet is someone who names and, by doing so, makes being appearing and transparent.<br>

Abstract: Dans le hiatus entre le langage et la pluralité des langues s'insère le problème de la traduction. D'un autre côté traduire a aussi une signification plus ample, qui couvre la communication entre les hommes et aussi la communication avec soi-même (voir Jakobson, Steiner). Le problème de la traduction est ici abordé du point de vue d'une herméneutique qui dialogue avec les sciences du langage et qui est engagée dans une réflexion sur la condition humaine, finie et charnelle. Si nous savons renoncer au rêve d'une langue unique et d'une traduction parfaite, en partant d'une relecture en termes positifs du récit de Babel, nous pourrons accueillir l'étranger dans la lignée d'une théorie et une pratique de l'hospitalité langagière (Ricœur). D'autre part, même notre quête personnelle d'identité passe par un travail énorme et jamais définitif de traduction, qui coïncide avec l'histoire de nos vies, avec son réseau infini d'actions et de passions et avec le travail du deuil et de la mémoire que cette œuvre exige. In the gap between language and the multiplicity of languages comes the problem of translation. To translate, moreover, also has a wider meaning, which covers both communication between people and communication with oneself (see Jakobson, Steiner). The problem of translation is examined here from the point of view of a hermeneutic that is both in dialogue with the disciplines of language and engaged in reflection on the human condition, which is both finite and corporeal. If we can put aside the dream of a single language and a perfect translation, starting from a re-reading in positive terms of the story of Babel, we can welcome the stranger in accordance with a theory and practice of linguistic hospitality (Ricœur). On the other hand, even our personal search for identity takes place through an enormous and never definitive work of translation, which coincides with our life history, with its infinite network of actions and passions and with the work both of grief ~<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this article is that the process of 'reading' (or constructing) a context is somehow analogous to the process of reading a text. The tools, concepts and categories developed in literary criticism to read texts may therefore be helpful for New Testament scholars' endevours to find ways and means to read context(s). Following a reflection on different possible conseptualisations of text and context, the notion of 'reading the context' is considered in the rest of the article on two levels: (i) the distinction between 'critic' and 'reader' in literary criticism is related to the distinction between 'emic' and 'etic' perspectives in cultural criticism, and (ii) the applicability of W Iser's phenomenological discription of the reading process for cultural criticism is considered and related to R Schreiter's methodological proposal for 'listening to cultures'.<br>

Abstract: By exploring different aspects of an 'ethical' reading of a New Testament document, this paper is concerned with the challenge of an integrated, relevant approach towards understanding the letter to the Ephesians—an approach which would account for its nature as ancient canonised text, as well as the needs of contemporary readers. By way of illustration, the identity and roles of different groups of people referred to in the text are re-examined in terms of the rhetorical function of the letter as a whole.<br>

Abstract: An investigation into poets' creative use of the Christian Bible reveals that receptions of the Bible as an imaginative text play an important role in what is achieved in such poems. The article will deal with a coherent group of poems by Antjie Krog, Die Jerusalemgangers, in a volume titled Jerusalemgangers (1985). It consists of eight different poems grouped into three sections. Voices from many centuries echo in these poems. The central theme is developed through four main perspectives, namely a male leader, a 'black consciousness' voice, a woman visionary and the all-embracing and composing perspective of the poet as visionary which incorporates the perspectives of other South African literary voices. This central theme concerns the universal quest for a Utopia, in these poems with their religiously conscious speakers, Utopia is presented in the Biblical imagery of a new Jerusalem. The creative process is activated as each voice, in its pursuit of an imaginary ideal context, uses the same text as a guiding principle on its 'journey' towards 'liberation'. The poet juxtaposes ideological readings of the Christian Bible, directed by different experiences of the South African context. The poet's vision clearly becomes a voice among others and yet it functions as a composing factor. This leads to commenting secular texts entering into the discourse. In the poetic text structuring and linguistic principles can lead to aesthetic insights into ostensibly unreconciled elements. The reading of the poems presented in this article will be directed by such poetic conventions. An attempt will be made to identify the signifying role of the poet's response to the Biblical imagery. The reader's response to these poems is likewise influenced by an acquaintance with the Bible.<br>

Abstract: This article reassesses the importance of historical biblical scholarship, but from the perspective of those who views are seldom considered by the academy, namely, poor, working-class and marginalized 'readers' of the Bible. Recognising that these 'readers' of Bible do have an interest in socio-historical matters, both in the present contexts and in the biblical texts, the article goes on to an analysis of how we might go about appropriating socio-historical modes of reading in our work with ordinary 'readers' of the Bible. It is here that the article engages with the historicity of myth and the myth of historicity. First, it is argued that the historically interested socially engaged scholar who works with ordinary 'readers' of the Bible should be overtly aware of the myth of historicity. Such scholars must embody a more nuanced view of history in the very act of imparting historical information in our collaborative work with non-scholars. Second, when biblical narratives are granted mythic significance – that is, they are signified as meaning, powerful and true irrespective of their historical claims – the task of the socially engaged biblical scholar is to respond with critical responsibility to the academy and with social accountability to our context.<br>

Author(s): Ossom-Batsa George<br>
Abstract: This article interprets Mark 14:22-25, using one of the new approaches in biblical interpretation, namely, pragmatic analysis. In pragmatic analysis, a text is considered a linguistic unit composed of linguistic elements (signs) with the scope of communicating a message. Interpretation involves examining the linguistic elements, the relationship between them (the syntax), their semantic valence in view of their communicative potentiality. Reading Mark 14:22-25 with this approach leads us to the conclusion that the evangelist included the institution account in his Gospel primarily to explain the significance and effect of Jesus' death to the reader. By adequately preparing the reader on the power of the word of Jesus before coming to read the institution account, Mark achieves a rhetorical effect: the conviction of the power of the words of Jesus and an admiration for the generosity of Jesus. This elicits in the reader an attraction to enter into Jesus' covenant.<br>

Abstract: Are the readings of Luke being proposed in this volume evidence of readers finding in the text what they want? Different readings of the same text can be related to different manifestations of "the reader". Yet a responsible reading of the text implies taking the text as a speech-act functioning in a communicative context. The role of the author and the context therefore becomes important again. The concept of foolproof composition is relevant too ās it implies the exclusion of the possibility of a counterreading of the text. Tlie phenomenon of the inspiration of a sacred text also functions as a constraint.<br>

Abstract: In this paper some elements of the reading process of Luke 12:35-48 are analysed according to the theory of Wolfgang Iser. Two problems are stated in the introduction, namely the impossibility of accounting for the reading process exhaustively in one all-encompassing theory, and the difficulty of "applying" Iser's theory, which is proposed as a theory of the reading process and not a method for analysing the reading process of an actual text. After a short exposition of the philosophical background and the main elements of the theory, a description of some elements of the reading process of this particular text is given. The paper concludes with a short reflection on the viability of this theory for a practical reception analysis.<br>

Abstract: The study of the wider context of the rhetorical structure (as distinct from discrete rhetorical features) is proposed to apply to two areas: (1) the story and discourse, or signified and signifier, which concerns all matters in, and of, the text; and (2) the materiality of reading which concerns all matters presumably outside the text The polarity between text and textuality is explored at length in the five most important relations in which rhetorical features figure importantly.<br>

Abstract: Interpretation has to take into consideration three poles: author, text and interpreter. In the field of literary studies deconstruction has provoked much interest and concern. The scope of this paper is to illustrate this activity of deconstruction unfolding by means of a reading of the parable of the Supervising Servant. This illustration from the Scriptures shows what happens to every text which is read again. It is reinterpreted anew according to new contexts. It is an example of the dissemination of the Word, whereby the Word becomes flesh.<br>

Abstract: The explication of contextualisation in terms of metaphor theory facilitates the utilisation of procedures of literary analysis, the idea of the model reader of a text, as well as the social analysis of discourses for the explication of the contextualisation of a text. The explication of the interaction between text and reader, or contextualiser in terms of metaphor theory explains some of the complexities involved in reading or contextualising texts. In the metaphoric interaction between text and reader the activity of contextualisation functions as a contextual or situational filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the discourse of the reader, implying statements about it that normally apply to the text. As a text in counter-determining context, the text is retroactively determined by the discourse which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the text, implying statements about it that normally apply to the discourse or context.<br>

Abstract: Communities, whether they are "real" or virtual, are mediated by interpretation. One's place within a community is also constituted by an ongoing metaphoric "reading" through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do. Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts. Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities, which makes them into forums that attempt to "connect the scattered members of an invisible republic" [1, p. 43] in an electronic world.<br>

Author(s): Franzen Aaron B.<br>
Abstract: The Bible is an important text in American history, but research analyzing the social consequences of reading the Bible is very limited. Research focusing on religious practices or religiosity with Bible reading as part of a scale shows a tendency towards conservatism and traditionalism, as do more literalist views of the Bible. In the present study, biblical literalism is treated as a powerful context guiding one's reading. The focus here is a quantitative view of Bible reading, deploying two 'conservative' and two 'liberal' moral/political scales and two competing views for how Bible reading may function. Results indicate that Bible reading is positively related to both of the liberal scales as well as the conservative scales for non-literalists, but not for those with literalist Bible views. The findings begin to show the importance of independent Bible reading, how it may function differently for literalists and non-literalists, and highlights the degree to which literalism and Bible reading are different constructs.<br>

Article Title: Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Dual Economy of Recognition<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>

Author(s): Schäfer Stefanie<br>
Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Abstract: In the past decades the concept of recognition has moved to the center of social theory. Can this concept be of use for American Studies and, more specifically, American literary and cultural studies? My essay tries to answer this question in five parts: first, a discussion of two opposite views of the social and cultural role of recognition exemplified by Charles Taylor and Alexis de Tocqueville; second, a reconsideration of the concept of identity, since recognition is inextricably linked with questions of identity formation in current debates; third, a description of the ways in which the struggle for recognition stands at the center of fictional texts and forms an imaginary core that has often been forgotten in the professionalization of literary studies; fourth, an analysis of how recognition can be understood and described as an effect of the reading experience (and of aesthetic experience more generally); and fifth, a return to the starting question of this essay, namely what the concept of recognition can contribute to American Studies and how it can be assessed in comparison with other, currently dominant approaches in the field.<br>

Abstract: Examining the coverage in seven major Japanese and Taiwanese daily newspapers of a selection of events involving both societies in the first decade of the twenty-first century, this paper investigates the phenomenon of rhetorical instrumentalization of the past for present ideological purposes. The concerns of this study are the processes of dehistorization in Japanese and Taiwanese news and public debate, and through a critical thematic reading of the sources I argue that a motif of Taiwanese repetition and imitation of Japan runs through all the studied cases as a basic narrative formula. Analyzed cases include news presentations of Taiwanese politicians visiting Japan, controversial statements on Taiwan by a Japanese cabinet minister, infrastructure developments in present-day Taiwan and the controversy surrounding a Japanese guidebook to Taiwanese prostitution. Throughout the material, Taiwan is pictured as ideally progressing along a trajectory marked out by Japan and the two are cast in fixed roles that recall their relative positions in the half-century of Japanese colonization of Taiwan: Japan teaches Taiwan order, unity and modern development and Taiwan studies Japan's past to overcome the challenges of its own present. Or Taiwan spontaneously imitates Japanese precedence as a consequence of its own development. This paper fundamentally challenges the rationale underlying strategic instrumentalization of the past and draws critical attention to the paradoxical fact that the use of the repetition formula positions the covered news events in a thematic field of time-lag and retrospection.<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author does a reading of the narratives concerning Guatemalan Indian Rigoberta Menchú, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992. The first part analyzes the way in which oral history turns to binary relations like public and private or text and context. In the second part, Claudia de Urna Costa concentrates on problems arising in the production and translation of cultural diversities and once again reinforces binary oppositions like the First and Third Worlds. L'auteur fait une lecture des narratives sur Rigoberta Menchú, indienne guatémaitèque, Prix Nobel de la Paix en 1992. Dans la première partie de l'article, Claudia de Lima Costa analyse la façon par laquelle l'histoire orale se tourne vers les relations binaires telles que publique et privé, texte et contexte. Dans la deuxième partie, elle s'Interroge sur les problèmes de production et traduction des diversités culturelles et, à nouveau, renforce les oppositions binaires comme Premier et Tiers-Monde.<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that a common reading of Max Weber's social science and its treatment of interpretation as either insufficiently or excessively "scientific" on the model of the natural sciences is inadequate. Freed from the either/or opposition of naturalism and humanism, and read through the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Weber can be read as offering a way forward for the social sciences that embraces both the subjective orientation of social scientists and the objective aspirations of social science.<br>

Abstract: Présentation et analyse de l'ouvrage Penser la Bible de Paul Ricœur et André LaCocque, qui s'efforce de montrer sous quelles conditions la rencontre entre l'exégèse historico-critique et l'herméneutique philosophique peut devenir féconde. Le point de rencontre se situe à l'intersection de l'histoire de la réception et d'une poétique de lecture. Cela trouve son illustration dans six stations de lecture consacrés à des passages clé de l'Ancien Testament : Gn 2-3, Ex 20,13, Ez 37, Ps 22, Ex 3,14, Ct. Pour chaque texte, l'analyse s'efforce de faire apparaître la complémentarité, mais aussi les tensions entre l'approche exégétique et l'approche philosophique. A review-article of Penser la Bible, by Paul Ricœur and André LaCocque. The book tries to show under which conditions historico-critical exegesis and philosophical hermeneutic can meet fruitfully. They meet at the intersection between the history of reception and a poetic of reading. This is illustrated by six readings devoted to key portions of the Old Testament: Gen 2-3; Ex 20,13; Ez 37; Ps 22; Ex 3,14; Ct. For each of those texts, the study endeavours to show the complementarity of, and also the tensions between exegetical and philosophical tradings of the Bible.<br>

Author(s): Viviano Benedict Thomas<br>
Abstract: This article reexamines Matt 2:1-23 in the light of the late twentieth century movement called theological aesthetics. After briefly sketching the movement with its emphasis on beauty rather than truth or goodness as the starting point for this approach to theology and the Bible, the article considers the often conflicted relationship between beauty and truth in western civilization and the Bible. It then attempts a close reading of Matthew 2, resulting in a new awareness of how carefully the evangelist has interwoven elements of beauty and ugliness, truth and mendacity into his narrative. Cet article examine Matthieu 2:1-23 à la lumière du mouvement contemporain qu'on appelle l'esthétique théologique. Après une brève esquisse de ce mouvement, l'article considère les rapports souvent conflictuels entre la beauté et la vérité, en particulier le masque que la beauté peut fournir à l'abus de pouvoir. Puis il propose une relecture de Matthieu 2 de façon à faire ressortir avec une clarté nouvelle le soin que met l'évangéliste à entrelacer les éléments du beau et du laid, du vrai et du mensonge, dans son récit de deux rois qui se battent pour être à la tête du peuple de Dieu.<br>

Author(s): PAYEN Pascal<br>
Abstract: D'un côté, l'Enquête d'Hérodote rapporte les projets de domination qui, de Crésus à Xerxès, constituent la trame des rapports entre Grecs et Barbares, de 561 à 479. Mais, de l'autre, le lecteur ne peut oublier que de larges sections décrivent les coutumes et l'espace de nombreux peuples dès que la conquête les menace. Cette dynamique s'enracine dans les conditions matérielles de création et de lecture au Ve siècle avant J.-C, et dans les héritages narratifs que transforme Hérodote (Vies, Catalogues ...). Or aucun conquérant n'est glorifié ni présenté comme un vainqueur, tandis que les peuples visés opposent la singularité de leur espace et l'étrangeté de leurs coutumes, soit un genre de vie devenu stratégie de résistance, en associant particularisme insulaire et fuite calculée sur le modèle nomade. Les Grecs, de même, tantôt conquérants insatiables mais défaits, tantôt résistants invaincus, contribuent à monter que, chez Hérodote, l'autre a le visage de celui qui résiste plutôt que du Barbare. Il s'agit donc bien d'une autre écriture du passé, qui sauve de l'oubli tous les peuples décrits, non les seuls hauts faits des Rois. Les mêmes images sont employées pour décrire la résistance insulaire des nomades, et pour dire le cheminement de l'écriture, ainsi en relation d'homologie avec son objet. On one hand, Herodotus' Inquiry reports the plan of domination which from Croesus to Xerxes composes the system of the relation between Greeks and Barbarians, from 561 to 479. But on the other hand, the reader cannot forget that large sections describe customs and many people's area when they are threatened by conquest. This discrepancy has its roots in the material conditions of creativity and reading in the fifth century B.C., and to the narrative forms available to Herodotus (Lives, Lists...). However, no conqueror was praised nor spoken of as a victor, while people shown opposed their individual space and their peculiar customs, that is to say a way of life set up as a stra~<br>

Abstract: This essay redefines the task of the reader in light of Christian hope, unfolding how a theology of hope might ground literary criticism. The resulting approach to literature—hopeful reading—considers texts in light of their future becoming in the Kingdom of God. Rather than considering texts as purveyors of hope or possibility for a readers future, hopeful reading asks critics to non-instrumentally foreground the possibilities in a text's future. The essay explains Christian hope, shows how it might warrant and construct a literary critic's vocation, and offers several extended examples of contemporary critics who seem to be reading hopefully.<br>

Author(s): Römer Thomas<br>
Abstract: Cet article se propose de lire l'Ancien Testament comme littérature de crise à partir d'un paradigme fourni par la sociologie moderne. Trois attitudes principales caractérisent les réactions intellectuelles face à la situation de crise: l'attitude «utopique», l'attitude «nostalgique» et l'attitude «scientifique». Ces trois attitudes permettent de décrire les grands courants idéologiques du peuple hébreu face au drame national de l'exil babylonien. Pour les prophètes, l'exil apparaît comme un temps intermédiaire annonçant une ère de salut. Les milieux sacerdotaux présentent le retour aux institutions religieuses passées comme la seule solution à la crise. Les intellectuels de l'école deutéronomiste cherchent à comprendre les raisons du drame de l'exil sans immédiatement proposer de solutions pour le futur. La société juive de l'époque exilique, puis post-exilique est caractérisée par la cohabitation et le dialogue de ces différentes perspectives. Cette cohabitation peut être proposée comme paradigme pour une approche de la crise en société moderne. This article proposes the reading of the Old Testament as crisis literature according to a paradigm of modern sociology. Three principle attitudes typify intellectual reactions to crisis: the "utopic", the "nostalgic" and the "scientific". These can help us describe the main ideological currents of the Hebrew nation faced with the drama of the Babylonian exile. For the prophets, the exile is an interim announcing a time of salvation. For the priestly circle, the return to former religious institutions is the only solution to the crisis. The intellectual Deuteronomists seek to understand the reasons for the tragedy of the exile without proposing immediate solutions. Jewish society at the time of the exile and after it is distinguished by the cohabitation and dialogue between these different perspectives. This cohabitation may serve as a paradigm for an approach to crises in modern society.<br>

Abstract: En travaillant sur quelques reprises littéraires des récits de la Passion du Christ, l'article tente de montrer comment la relecture littéraire permet de redécouvrir la manière dont les textes bibliques interpellent leurs lectrices et lecteurs. En particulier, il s'attache à faire apparaître comment certains personnages de ces récits, par la transposition littéraire, deviennent des offres fictives d'identité narrative. Pour ce faire, l'auteur se laisse guider par la théorie de la narrativité de Paul Ricoeur et la conception de l'acte de lecture de Wolfgang her. Using literary renditions of the Passion narratives, this article tries to show how literary rereadings allow us to discover the way biblical texts interpellate the reader. In particular, it seeks to bring out the way certain characters, in the literary transposition of these stories, become fictive overtures of narrative identity. The author is inspired by Paul Ricoeur's theory of narrativity and Wolfgang Iser's idea of the act of reading.<br>

Abstract: Comme son sous-titre l'indique, cet article a pour but de développer un contrepoint au livre de Pierre Gisel qui fait l'objet du débat présenté dans ce numéro. En dialogue critique avec cet ouvrage, il tente de formuler une autre manière de concevoir la théologie aujourd'hui. Après avoir explicité les conditions et la base d'accord de ce dialogue, il reprend successivement la question de la définition de la théologie, le problème des rapports entre théologie et sciences des religions et les difficultés liées à la relecture des héritages, pour se terminer par une évaluation globale du projet de Pierre Gisel. As indicated by its sub-title, this article develops an objection to the book of Pierre Gisel, subject of the debate in the present edition. In critical dialogue, it tries to formulate a different way of conceiving theology today. After exposing the conditions and basis for agreement in this debate, it takes up in succession the question of the definition of theology, the problem of the relationships between theology and the science of religions and the difficulties linked to the re-reading of traditions, finishing with a global evaluation of the project of Pierre Gisel.<br>

Abstract: Le but de cette intervention est de mettre en dialogue les pensées de Paul Ricœur et de Gerhard Ebeling à partir du concept de parole efficace. La première partie entreprend de montrer, notamment à travers les lectures ricœuriennes d'Ebeling dans les années 1960 et 1980, que le théologien allemand est plus «barthien» que le philosophe français en ce qui concerne le mouvement herméneutique de la distanciation. Dans la seconde partie, question se pose, à travers une confrontation plus indirecte entre les deux auteurs, de savoir dans quelle mesure Ricœur est plus «barthien» qu'Ebeling par rapport au mouvement contraire de l'appropriation. Dans sa conclusion, l'auteur avance la thèse selon laquelle Ebeling serait plus cohérent que Ricœur dans sa réflexion autour de la parole efficace. The aim of this essay is to juxtapose the thinking of Paul Ricoeur and Gerhard Ebeling on the basis of the concept of efficient word. The first part, notably through Ricoeur's reading of Ebeling, tries to show that in the 1960's-80's, the German theologian was more «Barthian» than the French philosopher on the topic of the hermeneutical movement of detachment. The second part, by a more indirect confrontation between the two writers, poses the question to what degree Ricoeur is more «Barthian» that Ebeling on the opposite movement of appropriation. The article concludes with the theory that Ebeling is more coherent than Ricoeur in his thinking about efficient word.<br>

Abstract: Quelques questions philosophiques suggérées par la lecture du livre de J.-P. Jossua Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. Le recours à l'« expérience » devant la faillite des divers dogmatismes permet-il de donner un sens au témoignage de l'absolu? Le refus d'appuyer le christianisme à la culpabilité doit-il aboutir nécessairement à une revendication d'innocence sans intégrer l'apport des analyses de la flnitude et thématiser la condition de créature, inséparablement innocente et coupable? Penser que l'écriture est le lieu privilégié de manifestation du « je », n'est-ce pas recourir au postulat ontologique de la vérité comme fusion de la parole, du sens, du vécu, de la présence de l'homme et de sa vie? Some philosophical questions which arose from reading the book of J.-P. Jossua, Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. When faced with the failure of various dogmatisms, would not the recourse to "experience" by its very nature prevent "witness" from being an affirmation of the Absolute? By refusing to let Christianity lean on culpability, would one necessarily end up in a claim of innocence which would not integrate the contribution of analyses of limitedness and which would not come to grips with the condition of a creature which is inseparably innocent and culpable? By thinking that writing is the privileged place for the manifestation of the "ego", is one not resorting to the ontological postulate of truth as an amalgamation of word, sens, existence of man and life?<br>

Abstract: L'article étudie les modifications successives et conjointes des arguments de convenance et des structures du traité de l'Incarnation au long de l'itinéraire de S. Thomas. Il se propose de contester l'habitude de réduire la place du Christ dans la Somme Théologique à la simple causalité rédemptrice. Une lecture attentive de la première question de la Tertia pars de la Somme Théologique établit que l'opposition habituelle entre Incarnation et Rédemption se trouve dépassée dans la découverte du mystère pascal de Jésus comme la manifestation et la réalité de Dieu toujours plus grand. La Christologie est alors tout autre chose qu'un appendice : la consummatio totius theologici negotii, clef de voûte et principe de toute la théologie. The article studies the successive and conjunct modifications of the arguments of convenance and the structures the treatise on the Incarnation throughout St. Thomas' itinerary. It is proposed to contest the habit of reducing the place of Christ in the Summa Theologica to a simple redemptive causality. An attentive reading of the first question of the Tertia Pars of the Summa Theologica establishes that the habitual opposition between Incarnation and Redemption is found to be surpassed in the discovery of the Pascal Mystery of Jesus as the manifestation and reality of the always greater God. The Christology is then quite other than a mere appendix: the consummatio totius theologici negotii, keystone and principle of all theology.<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Abstract: La conception de la contemplation et de la vie contemplative connaît une évolution intéressante dans un ordre contemplatif par excellence, celui des Chartreux entre ses débuts et la fin du XIIIe siècle. Cet article tente d'explorer ce tournant à partir de l'analyse de trois auteurs: Guigues II, Hugues de Balma, Guigues du Pont. Héritier de la tradition monastique de la lectio divina, le premier met en place l'échelle des moines montant de la lecture à la méditation, à la prière et à la contemplation. Mais le second en scie les barreaux : concevant une théologie mystique, union affective à Dieu sans connaissance antécédente ou concomitante, il conduit au paradoxe d'une vie contemplative sans contemplation. Les distinctions subtiles du dernier rendent à la théologie mystique une contemplation anagogique et font place à ses côtés à une contemplation spéculative des philosophes, des théologiens, des mystiques. The understanding of contemplation and the contemplative life sees an interesting evolution in an order contemplative par excellence, the Carthusians, between its beginnings and the end of the XIIIth century. On the basis of the analyses of three authors, Guigues II, Hugh of Balma, and Guigues Du Pont, this article endeavors to explore this turn. Heir to the monastic tradition of lectio divina, the first sets in place the ladder for monks ascending from reading to meditation, from prayer to contemplation. Yet the second saws apart the rungs. Conceiving of a mystical theology, an affective union with God without preceding or concomitant knowledge, he shows the way to the paradox of a contemplative life without contemplation. The subtle distinctions of the last bestow upon mystical theology an anagogic contemplation and clear the away around it for a speculative contemplation of the philosophers, theologians and mystics.<br>

L'auteur y montre les changements dans les thèses de Changeux en les accompagnant de ses commentaires philosophiques et théologiques aussi bien critiques que constructifs. L'homme, ses origines et sa structure, le cerveau humain, la conscience de soi, la matière et sa complexité évolutive, la sensibilité artistique, la morale, la religion, la question d'une lecture intégrale de Darwin et de Spinoza, la signification du discours sur « l'homme de vérité » sont les principaux sujets traités. Le but de l'article est un dialogue interdisciplinaire entre neurosciences et théologie sur la compréhension de l'être humain. This article passes in revue the following works of the neurobiologist J.-P. Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (a dialogue with Paul Ricœur), 1998, and L'homme de vérité, 2002. The author shows the changes in Changeux's theses, accompanying them with his philosophical and theological commentaries, critical as well as constructive. Man, his origins and structure, the human brain, self consciousness, matter and its progressive complexity, artistic sensibility, morality, religion, the question of an integral reading of Darwin and Spinoza, and the significance of discourse upon « L'homme de vérité » are the principal subjects treated. The goal of the article is an interdisciplinary dialogue between the neurosciences and theology about the understanding of the human being.<br>

Author(s): WiedemannAbstract: Since antiquity, Sallust has been said to have modeled his historiography after Thucydides. Focusing on the voice of the narrator, this article draws attention to an aspect that distinguishes Sallust from Thucydides and reminds us more of Herodotus. While Thucydides's narrative seems to unravel itself, Sallust makes his presence as narrator strongly felt by first-person interventions and expressions of uncertainty (I). Moreover, he integrates other voices at the extradiegetic level (II). These features of Sallust's voice give his account a strong mimetic aspect, underscore his reliability and engage the readers in the "act of reading."<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i413081<br>
Date: 3 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Zelinsky Jonathan M.<br>
Abstract: Concepts of place, narrative, tradition, and identity are employed in a conservative reading of the Texas A&M Bonfire. Texas A&M embodied regional narratives of a dual Southern commitment to economic and technological development and conservation of traditional cultural. Institutionalized at Texas A&M in the late nineteenth century, these narratives made a paradoxical place. Bonfire expressed and obscured this paradox. In line with the narrative of tradition, Texas A&M was an all-male military school until 1965. The students were uniform, isolated, and regimented. This social structure engendered intense feelings of loyalty and community. These social emotions were further aroused at events like yell practice, and projected onto Bonfire. After the Second World War the commitment of university administrators to economic and technological progress increasingly threatened the narrative of tradition and the cultivation of manliness. Student veneration of Bonfire intensified. After 1965 mandatory military drill was discontinued, women were enrolled, and the student body was enlarged. Social pluralism fragmented the meaning of Bonfire; conflict and disorderly behavior ensued. By the 1990s the university had partly rationalized Bonfire as a corporate symbol; however, this trend was tragically terminated in 1999 when the cumulative errors of the oral tradition caused Bonfire to collapse, killing twelve students.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219755<br>
Date: 5 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Toulmin Paul B.<br>
Abstract: The debate about validity in interpretation has pitted monism against pluralism. Some theorists insist that any literary work has a single, determinate meaning, and others argue that there are no limits to the readings a text allows. Neither view adequately describes the field of conflicting interpretations. Critics can and do have legitimate disagreements about literary works; yet we can also say that some readings are wrong, not simply different. The hermeneutic field is divided among conflicting systems of interpretation, each based on different presuppositions that decide what its procedures will disclose and what they will disguise. But several tests for validity-inclusiveness, efficacy, and intersubjectivity-act as constraints on reading and regulate claims to legitimacy. While these tests have limitations that prevent them from resolving all hermeneutic disagreements, literary criticism is nevertheless a rational, disciplined enterprise-though an inherently pluralistic one.<br>

Article Title:  أسطورة الخلق في شرق أفريقيا / The Myth of Creation in East Africa <br>
Publisher: American University in Cairo. Department of English and Comparative Literature<br>
Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Issue: i227575<br>
Date: 3 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Wolf Vincanne<br>
Abstract: This exploration of a Himalayan Sherpa ritual engages contemporary cultural anthropology debates concerning ethnographic essentialism, positivism, and so-called postmodernist approaches. The author notes a parallelism between Buddhist Sherpa ritual processes that call upon patrons to engage in mimesis with idealized images of themselves and ethnographic representations that call for Sherpas to become that which is desired by foreign others. A positivist reading of Sherpas thus leads us toward both a necessary reflexivity about the effects of our writing upon them and the adoption of a strategic essentialism aware of its karmic consequences.<br>

Abstract: The new information technologies have transformed reading practices in meaningful ways, promoting other skills and competences, and activating new ways of interacting with reading devices. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Mexico City, this article aims to explore how communicational innovations have had an impact on a specific type of reader, whose distinctive feature is to have an intense and/or enjoyable relationship with the act of read: the cultural creators. The analysis of these practices and the reflection as a result of this, allows us to observe that, far from creating isolated readers, the emerging technologies contribute to develop, in other ways,the potential for the sociability of reading, thus stimulating work networks and collaborative projects.<br>

Abstract: A conflict is a relational space in crisis in which the antagonists determine, in an interactive dynamic, what is at stake. As the negotiation goes by, ego states his truth line, while alter builds his offensive line based on a truth that becomes reality. Defending one’s truth means also fighting for one’s integrity; in other words, defining my truth is also giving a structure to my integrity, to my own self. If the literature of the I has frequently conflicts in its pages, it is probably because the reading pact is tied up to the truth. But making a narrative of the self out of the configuration system can also get the text in another kind of conflict where the frontiers of the diegetic levels become more and more permeable. Despite everything, the illocutary power in autobiographic literature, seems to change the way the « I » sees himself, and gives him a new ethos that suits him fine.<br>

Abstract: I have been sent for review a book on queer Christology (Christology beyond the orthodox margins). It is interesting to note reactions when I have left the book on the table to see whether people comment. Perhaps the most common reaction is that such a book should not even be in my reading list – such is the fear of the margin and beyond. The study of belief revision (expansion, revision, contraction) has become a branch of philosophy. See

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: e90012057<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): DAVIS ANDREW<br>
Abstract: This article proposes that Romantic sonatas exploit in their formal structures multiply directed temporal narratives, comprising a temporal stream and various other streams that can be broadly characterized as
         atemporal. The temporal stream articulates the principal sonata trajectory and correlates with the concept known in structural narratology as thefirst narrative; the atemporal streams reside on alternate temporal levels and remain external to, or disengaged from, that of the first narrative. The structural and expressive implications of this opposition, together with the view of sonata-formal conventions made available in recent work on Sonata Theory, provide a framework within which the article explicates Chopin’s robust dialogue, in the first movement of his Piano Sonata in B Minor, Op. 58, with Classical German-Austrian sonata conventions and contemporary Romantic aesthetic currents. The reading provides a foundation for reassessing Chopin’s work in the sonata genre, the norms and expressive potential of which he is often thought of as never fully apprehending.<br>

Publisher: Universidad de Chile<br>
Issue: e90016177<br>
Date: 11 1, 2017<br>
Author(s): T. Leonidas Morales<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the last two novels by Adolfo Couve, La comedia del arte (1996) and Cuando pienso en mi falta de cabeza (La segunda comedia), posthumously published in 2000. The article proposes an allegorical reading of the transformation of the painter Camondo into a wax statue, the protagonist of both novels who later loses his mind. The article argues that the loss of the mind allegorizes a quotidian time, in tune with Couve's world, which spins and repeats itself, closed, without a horizon, a “beheaded” time (lacking future). This allows the possibility to build a coherent sense of a series of narrative forms (which include language, space, time, characters) and that, taken as a whole, show the particular way in which Couve's narrative is built and developed.<br>

Abstract: Desire, as Martin Hägglund claims in
         Dying For Time, has been erringly conceived in philosophical, literary, and psychoanalytic traditions as testifying to a fundamental lack of being. In response, Hägglund develops the notion of chronolibido, a theory that posits the constitutive difference of desire as testifying to temporal finitude and mortality as the object of desire. In the rubric of chronolibido, the desire for immortality dissimulates a preceding desire for survival. This review takes up Hägglund's theory of desire and examines the implications of chronolibido for reading modernist literature.<br>

Abstract: For both Levinas and Derrida, the practice of philosophy, understood as commentary by the former and deconstruction by the latter, was founded on borrowing terms from other languages and finding their equivalents in French. This argument is developed through a discussion of two texts, Levinas's early Talmudic reading, “The Temptation of Temptation,” and Derrida's deconstruction of
         The Merchant of Venicein “What Is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?” This essay shows how translated terms are interwoven into these texts. It also shows that translation is essential to Levinas's and Derrida's creative conceptualization, and to the performativity of their philosophies, meaning that Levinas and Derrida open their language to other languages in order to create concepts. It finally argues that in both Derrida and Levinas the question of the limits of translation, namely, of the moment in which translation becomes conversion, is left open.<br>

Abstract: Surface reading and similar developments in literary study advocate a turn away from symptomatic reading toward the superficial and self-evident. Arguing for the productivity of these approaches despite the contradictory language in which they have sometimes been formulated, this essay develops a related form of analysis: literal or denotative reading. Denotative reading does not reject deep or figurative interpretive possibilities. Rather, it insists they must be pursued in close connection with the facticity of fictional worlds, particularly in the case of maritime and other fiction deploying a specialized, technical lexicon. The essay treats Joseph Conrad's
         Heart of Darkness(1899) as an exemplary instance of such fiction, contending that its precise articulation of tidal currents, nautical maneuvers, and ship design signals the key role of “restraint” not only in this novella but throughout Conrad's corpus.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews recent methodological interventions in the field of literary study, many of which take nineteenth-century critics, readers, or writers as models for their less interpretive reading practices. In seeking out nineteenth-century models for twenty-first-century critical practice, these critics imagine a world in which English literature never became a discipline. Some see these new methods as formalist, yet we argue that they actually emerge from historicist self-critique. Specifically, these contemporary critics view the historicist projects of the 1980s as overly influenced by disciplinary models of textual interpretation—models that first arose, we show through our reading of the Jolly Bargemen scene in Charles Dickens's
         Great Expectations(1860– 61), in the second half of the nineteenth century. In closing, we look more closely at the work of a few recent critics who sound out the metonymic, adjacent, and referential relations between readers, texts, and historical worlds in order sustain historicism's power to restore eroded meanings rather than reveal latent ones.<br>

Abstract: Hayes frequently uses recombination and assiduously designed constraints to link his poems to those of African American women poets who have preceded him. In
         Hip Logic, he includes as an epigraph a poem “made up of whole and partial lines in the index (underW) ofThe Collected Poems of.”audre lorde
            
               The collection also includes a sonnet entirely made up of the line “We sliced the watermelon into smiles” repeated fourteen times, and several odes. The bulk of the book is made up of a series of poems titled “A Gram of &S,” based on the daily word game found in the puzzle section of newspapers. Hayes explains in a note, “I end each line with one of the eleven words derived from the title word, while abiding by the other rules of the game: 1. Words must be derived from four or more letters. 2. Words that acquire four letters by the addition of ‘s,’ such as ‘bats’ or ‘dies’ are not used. 3. Only one form of a verb is used.”91
            
               In a more recent collection titled92
            Lighthead, Hayes also uses constraints. Reading just the end words of “The Golden Shovel” inLightheadgives the entirety of Gwendolyn Brooks's poem “We Real Cool”:

               Brooks's poem has been literally re-authored, as has Elizabeth Alexander's “Ladders,” which emerges in the end words of Hayes' poem “The Last Train to Africa”Men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.

Abstract: In addition to the numerous references to music there is also much in the style that is associated with music. Bryer calls attention to Fitzgerald's use of verbs to create movement. As examples, he quotes words like “splash” and “slit” (Bryer 126). In the sequence above we find fifteen verbs, a fact that would not be worth noting if they were not in a paragraph that usually is characterized as descriptive and illustrative. At least one of these verbs, “shorn,” also contains onomatopoetic phonetic qualities. The sound imagery is otherwise based on phrases such as “the bar is in full swing” and “the air is alive with chatter and laughter.” The rich texture of Fitzgerald's prose is thus not only reflected in its visual qualities but also in its descriptions of sounds, which further work inclusively in that they add atmosphere and sensuality to the narrative. The sounds of the summer are constantly infiltrating and fortifying our physical reading experience. It is the “whip and snap” of curtains, white dresses “rippling and fluttering,” and the “groan” of a picture on the wall in the windy summer room at the Buchanans. It is the “boom” and death of the “caught wind” when the door is shut (8). The nightingale sings outside (15). Jordan Baker reads a newspaper, her words “murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune,” turning pages with “a flutter of slender muscles in her arms” (17). At night the “wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life” (20).<br>

Abstract: Remembering is a function of the meaning-making process after the emptiness of loss. Spelder and Strickland suggest that “grief is the emotional response to bereavement, to the event of loss” (as qtd. in DuBose, 368). The theologian Todd J. DuBose explains that “grief gazes at an ever-receding present as it moves further and further into the past. The immediate reaction often involves bargaining for a reversal of the loss, denial, anger, shock, anguish, distress, sadness” (368). These reactions are the body's means of trying to make sense of the world in the wake of the emptiness created by bereavement. Interpreting Drew Leder and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's notion of chiasmic structure of the body, DuBose explains that the body realizes its existence only in relation to other bodies. It touches because it is being touched. Other bodies make ours perceptible. The disappearance of these other bodies in death is, in tune with the chiasmic structure of bodily existence, the disappearance of our own bodies. We experience that disappearance as pain, grief, sorrow. These manifestations of pain are, indeed, the ways our bodies adjust to vacuum and fill it with meaning. For DuBose, “meaning-making processes, which
         appearto be immaterial processes, are embodied phenomena. Reflection, perception, feeling, language, even logic make sense only through the influx of the body's ‘reading’ of space, time, action, and sensation” (370).<br>

Abstract: From the outset, all of us could see that nonscientific concerns, felt human sense, and pretheoretical understanding are not, as the patronizing label had it, “merely subjective” and thus philosophically unworthy. We all knew, for example, that no real human beings—except possibly Merleau-Ponty's Schneider—open their eyes in the morning and face the problem of whether percepts can be synthesized with concepts to make sure there is an external world. And whatever the good life is, it seemed pretty obvious that one gets no closer to it by defining ethical discourse as noncognitive or by obsessing over individuals and their moral rules while ignoring class interests, culture, and social structure. For me, the matter came to a head when I studied Dilthey on the difference between explaining nature and understanding people. On any fair reading of his beautiful accounts of how
      Verstehenworks and how a whole group of genuine sciences could be founded on it, Dilthey seemed obviously right. And yet, I was reading a fifty-year-old book by someone who had in the meantime clearly lost the argument.

Abstract: Four years later I was in Munich reading

My German friends informed me that contrary to U.S. procedure, one should attack not the person who wrote the review but the magazine that published it. My general line as I recall it was thatSpiegelwas so utterly incompetent that it hired a person to review the book who hadn't the slightest capacity to understand it. This, of course, was not untrue.Spiegel, the master of journalistic irony, must have loved my reaction because just two weeks after the review appeared it published my commentary along with others under the byline taken from my contribution, “Nicht begreifen,” he didn't get it.<br>

Abstract: Scott's texts, therefore, are not primarily informative. Like Lingis's texts, they are effective.
         The Time of Memoryseeks to “re-membermemory,” “to reconnect it to its own loss” (Scott1999, 21). This reconnection occurs not so muchinthe book asbetweenbook and reader. Scott's prose acts like a more or less gentle crowbar prying the lids off carefully packaged conceptual crates and barrels. As one reads and the crowbar pries, one's thoughts—often coming as involuntary memories—fly loose; they will not stay pinned down. Scott's books thus displace one's skill as reader, one's educated judgment, one's mastery of canon and methodology, as in their midst one confronts how little one understands, how much one cannot recall, and how tiny a measure of even what one calls “I” is really within one's grasp. Scott's work effects the impact of the not-I that happens with the I, the meaninglessnesses along with meaning.Imight be humbled in this impact, but pushed beyond one's ego, onefeelsno humiliation, only a lightening. In reading Scott's work I am, as Foucault might say, freed of myself.<br>

Abstract: Nonetheless, while I think that “correlationism” is a phony rap, there is something to Meillassoux's critique of “fideism,” because there is a version of Continental theory that sees it as a way to limit science in order to create a gap that can only be filled with faith in God. The real meaning of fideism is found in the God of the gaps. In my view, Continental theory is more “realistic” than Meillassoux allows, and it is also capable of a more critical reading of religion than the Kantian version of postmodern theory allows, which I think is indeed a version of fideism.

Abstract: Such vulnerability to assault raises questions of ethics that are central to the next section, entitled “Ethics and Reciprocity in Heidegger and Beauvoir.” Julie Kuhlken's article, “Heidegger and Aristotle: Action, Production, and Ethos,” considers Heidegger's practical philosophy, as expressed in his “Letter on Humanism,” in relation to his lectures on Aristotle from the 1920s. Through a discussion of Heidegger's distinctions between action and effecting and between ethics and ethos, Kuhlken argues that Heidegger's practical philosophy focuses less on ethics as it is typically understood today and more on the ancient notion of the good life. In “The Other (Woman): Limits of Knowledge in Beauvoir's Ethics of Reciprocity,” Ellie Anderson reassesses Beauvoir's ethics of reciprocity through a reading of her 1943 novel
      She Came to Stay. Anderson argues, against prominent readers of Beauvoir such as Penelope Deutscher and Debra Bergoffen, that central to Beauvoir's ethics is the recognition of the irreducible otherness or radical alterity of the other—and thus of a fundamental epistemic gap between self and other.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: A good model for envisioning how a hermeneutic phenomenology would engage Deleuze can be developed by drawing from resources established elsewhere in Ricoeur's thought. What I have in mind, specifically, is his reading of Freud in the book
         Freud and Philosophy.
               There Ricoeur reads Freud's work as “a mixed or even ambiguous discourse, which at times states conflicts of force subject to an energetics, at times relations of meaning subject to a hermeneutics.”22
            
               Freud's energetics, on the one hand, offers a naturalistic account of desire in which it is understood in terms of a cathexis—the placement and displacement of energy. And yet, psychoanalysis continually points back to the work of interpretation in which the psychoanalyst is dealing with conscious representations. The coexistence of these two discourses gives rise to an aporia, which Ricoeur formulates in the following way: “What is the status of representation or ideas in relation to the notions of instinct, aim of instinct and affect? How can an interpretation of meaning through meaning be integrated with an economics of cathexis, withdrawal of cathexis, anticathexis?”23
            
               To solve this aporia, Ricoeur goes on to show that these two discourses in Freud's work are not actually opposed. Instead, as he puts it, “the energetics implies a hermeneutics and the hermeneutics discloses an energetics.”24

Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Publisher: U of Wisconsin P<br>
Issue: style.34.issue-1<br>
Date: September 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Peters Joan Douglas<br>
Abstract: It has been over ten years since anything significant has been published on D. H. Lawrence's critical prose, and nothing of note has ever been written on the subject of the short essays—“The Novel,” “Surgery for the novel—Or a Bomb,” “Morality and the Novel,” and “Why the novel Matters”—containing his theory of the novel. The rhetorical style Lawrence adopts is so informal, so comical, and often so bizarre that the impulse of critics, when they do refer to these essays, is to ignore the rhetoric and somehow extract a system of logocentric doctrine, a doctrine that does not bear scrutiny. To appreciate Lawrence's genre theory, one cannot ignore the style in which it is written but must instead focus on the dynamics of discourse comprising the rhetorical text. Grounding my reading in Bakhtin's
         carnival, I argue that Lawrence celebrates the novel in terms of its “joyful relativity” (Bakhtin's term), a theory that articulates itself performatively in different ways through its own deconstruction. Read deconstructively, Lawrence's genre theory offers an important contribution to modernist concepts of language, an area from which Lawrence has traditionally been entirely excluded.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge UP<br>
Issue: style.36.issue-1<br>
Date: February 25, 1984<br>
Author(s): Alber Jan<br>
Abstract: In
         Towards a ‘Natural’ Narratology(1996), Monika Fludernik reconstitutes narrativity on the basis of experientiality, i.e., humanity's embodiedness in the world, and claims that incomprehensible texts can be made more readable if one attempts to narrativize them. Since Samuel Beckett's short prose work “Lessness” is one of the most enigmatic texts of the twentieth century, it serves as an ideal test case for this new narratological paradigm. “Lessness” does indeed lose its initial strangeness if one reads this piece as narrative. Moreover, although a “natural” narratological analysis paves the way for a new interpretation of “Lessness,” the new paradigm provides only a partially satisfying analysis of it. To make the text fit into the new consciousness-oriented paradigm, Fludernik's quasi-universal naturalizing mode has to ignore certain aspects such as the mechanical structure of “Lessness.” Beckett's later prose work challenges narrativization and the “natural” narratological project. A reading of “Lessness” should be liberated from the confines of experientiality and instead concentrate on the role of chance and chaos. Beckett's text must be located in a counterworld, a limbo between signifier and signified. One should allow this limbo world to seep into the “real world” and not attempt to explain this different counterworld by means of “real-world” knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Article Title: “Time and History in Blake's<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.22.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Although Burke had not read Bloch when he formulated his theory of dialectical-rhetorical transcendence, the similarities between the two theorists are remarkable. In particular, both Burke and Bloch emphasize the important role that art and creative letters play in this function of utopia/transcendent rhetoric. For Burke, there are two ways that political and social opposition can be transcended. One, which he says is exemplified by Mannheim, would still think in politically partisan terms. The other is Burke's own reinvention of Plato's dialectical process as an interpretive and generative tool. This way would transcend political partisanship at the level of poetic myth: Myth bursts into the discourse to reveal something out of the ordinary context, and we move beyond the limitations of reason into the potentialities of imagination. He illustrates this process with a reading of Castiglione's
         The Courtier. “By gradations,” writes Burke, “it builds a ladder of courtship dialectically, into a grand design that, in its ultimate stage, would transcend the social mystery, ending Platonically on a mystic, mythic vision of celestial mystery.”
               The handbook is usually studied as a book of manners, but Burke suggests that it had a strong rhetorical influence—perhaps a utopian-rhetorical influence—on the motives of Elizabethan poets and other courtiers of the period. The ultimate aim seems to be merging as closely with the ideal of a perfect courtier as possible and then to become the instructor of a prince (Aristotle and Alexander are cited as examples of this motive).34<br>

Abstract: This opposition between the static and the dynamic—and the triumph of the latter in
         Finnegans Wake—is modeled by Sheldon Brivic in terms of Joyce's symbolic uses of gender within the novel: “The male story enacts conflict and decline, but the female one may be seen as showing discovery and development that proceed through the disintegration of the discourse of patriarchal coherence.”
               Yet one might suggest not so much that the novel is about gender difference as that it deploys gender difference to symbolize the dichotomy between the static and dynamic historical perspectives upon which it reflects. Brivic admits that his feminist reading of156
            Finnegans Wakeshould not claim to reveal the novel's “ultimate or real meaning”—and if (as he writes) the novel represents “history as progress through literary work” in a way that offers “freedom through the disintegration of stable identity,”
               then it may be that, in order to engage with that progressive idealism, such determining terminologies as157
            feminism—orUtopianism, for that matter—and all of the categorical polarizations they involve might no longer seem particularly relevant. A static Utopia has no need for Utopianists (perfect worlds do not need dreamers); and a dynamic Utopia—a world populated by such aspirants—would have no need for such deterministic, static, and outmoded categorizations. A progressive Utopia must be unfinished; it is not a state but a perpetual coming-into-state in which all of its subjects continue to dream, to hope, to aspire. This work of progress is, likeFinnegans Wake, an unendingwork in progress. It may at first seem incongruous that this Utopia of unceasing movement is also the Utopia of real, material place, but it is clear that one of the defining characteristics of material reality is that it never stays still.<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Although modern architecture's association with Utopia could seem self-evident, considerations of architecture and Utopia from within the discipline and by utopian studies scholars are beset by a troubling lack of precision in defining the utopian dimensions of architecture and urbanism or how either might actually benefit from encounters with Utopia. If this assertion is accepted, any meaningful recuperation of Utopia for architecture
         mustbegin with clarifying what this might actually offer. In most circles, including architecture and utopian studies, visual representations of novel forms (and on occasion their construction) have been enough to designate individual works of architecture and city plans as utopian. Arguably, an unwillingness to risk strong declarations as to what makes works of architecture utopian—beyond newness—ensures that Utopia will remain an apparent irrelevance in discussions of architecture. By the same token, in the absence of definition, conventional readings of orthodox modern architecture as utopian, and as having actually attempted to give form to Utopia in its heyday, will persist. Because the preponderantly negative reading of modern architecture as utopian largely derives from profound dissatisfaction with the real failures of twentieth-century architecture to produce a humane city, Utopia has become a damning myth for architects and the public alike, even though the overconfident inventors of the modern city rarely if ever asserted Utopia as their aim.

Journal Title: Science Fiction Studies<br>
Article Title: “Terminus.”<br>
Publisher: Johns Hopkins UP<br>
Issue: sciefictstud.41.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 1973<br>
Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
