  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Animals-Rituals and Practices Surrounding Animal Death<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kalof Linda<br>
  Abstract: We live more intimately with nonhuman animals than ever before in history. The change in the way we cohabitate with animals can be seen in the way we treat them when they die. There is an almost infinite variety of ways to help us cope with the loss of our nonhuman friends-from burial, cremation, and taxidermy; to wearing or displaying the remains (ashes, fur, or other parts) of our deceased animals in jewelry, tattoos, or other artwork; to counselors who specialize in helping people mourn pets; to classes for veterinarians; to tips to help the surviving animals who are grieving their animal friends; to pet psychics and memorial websites. But the reality is that these practices, and related beliefs about animal souls or animal afterlife, generally only extend, with very few exceptions, to certain kinds of animals-pets. Most animals, in most cultures, are not mourned, and the question of an animal afterlife is not contemplated at all.
      Mourning Animalsinvestigates how we mourn animal deaths, which animals are grievable, and what the implications are for all animals.<br>

  Abstract: The Oslo Accords could not have occurred without a transformed Palestinian symbol system. Palestinians involved in the Oslo talks recounted that the terms used in describing the Palestinians and the contested land were in dispute at Oslo. However, the Israelis came to accept the phrase “Palestinian people” and the words “West Bank” and “Gaza” rather than “Judea” and “Samaria” to describe a common reality. In turn, the Palestinians recognized the state of Israel. Indeed, demonstrating the importance of the symbol, the wording of the Oslo Accords and references to people and land were at the center of the negotiations.¹ The<br>

  Abstract: AS A MODERN FIELD OF study, Ottoman historiography is unusual, primarily because of its ambivalent relation to that hegemon of hyper-reality, Europe—finding and placing itself both within and without. For much of its existence, the Ottoman Empire was dominated (demographically, economically, politically, ideologically) by its provinces in regions considered now geographically as part of Europe. This is something Ottoman authors oft en remarked upon when discussing the divisions of European geography, which the Well-Protected Domains straddled.<br>

  Abstract: Young minority men are often portrayed in popular media as victims of poverty and discrimination.
      A Dream Denieddelves deeper, investigating the social and cultural implications of the "American dream" narrative for young minority men in the juvenile justice systems in Boston and Chicago. This book connects young male offenders' cycles of desistance and recidivism with normative assumptions about success and failure in American society, exposing a tragic disconnect between structural reality and juvenile justice policy. This book challenges us to reconsider how American society relates to its most vulnerable members, how it responds to their personal failures, and how it promises them a better future.<br>

  Abstract: The contemporary Western philosophical scene can be characterized in terms of divisions and interactions between approaches to philosophy which assume that their task is inextricably linked to the development of the natural sciences and approaches which often regard this assumption with considerable suspicion. Philosophers who adopt the former approach have the obvious advantage that the project of which they see themselves as a part produces more and more results which are in principle—if not in practice—publicly testable and which appear to confirm their underlying assumption that science is converging towards an already constituted reality as it is “in<br>

  Book Title: Cannibal Talk-The Man-Eating Myth and Human Sacrifice in the South Seas<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: In this radical reexamination of the notion of cannibalism, Gananath Obeyesekere offers a fascinating and convincing argument that cannibalism is mostly "cannibal talk," a discourse on the Other engaged in by both indigenous peoples and colonial intruders that results in sometimes funny and sometimes deadly cultural misunderstandings. Turning his keen intelligence to Polynesian societies in the early periods of European contact and colonization, Obeyesekere deconstructs Western eyewitness accounts, carefully examining their origins and treating them as a species of fiction writing and seamen's yarns. Cannibalism is less a social or cultural fact than a mythic representation of European writing that reflects much more the realities of European societies and their fascination with the practice of cannibalism, he argues. And while very limited forms of cannibalism might have occurred in Polynesian societies, they were largely in connection with human sacrifice and carried out by a select community in well-defined sacramental rituals.
      Cannibal Talkconsiders how the colonial intrusion produced a complex self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the fantasy of cannibalism became a reality as natives on occasion began to eat both Europeans and their own enemies in acts of "conspicuous anthropophagy."<br>

  Abstract: The tales of the neighborhood that have been the focus of this book tell about the “neighborhood” of the Galilee in the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era. This neighborhood was at the time the birthing-ground for major religious and cultural formations that would prove consequential for many groups and peoples on a number of continents. Our entry into this milieu through the concept of a neighborhood has stressed small-scale processes, such as human relations and everyday life, rather than the major events of the period.

  Abstract: Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot's mutual interest in the Lascaux cave paintings signals their common concern to construct a discourse of origin in relation to art. Both writers consider origin in terms of the anxiety-filled questioning surrounding the ontological and historical aporias that have plagued Western thought, including those that appear under the banner of the Modern and the Postmodern. Both ask: what kind of discourse presides over the disconcerting doubling of reality performed by the first artists? For Bataille, origin is bound up with the ritual significance of eroticism and death as these underpin all forms of artistic endeavour;<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Abstract: While the Lord tarries, doctrine develops. The progress and growth of ideas is an inevitable historical reality, even in religious traditions purportedly rooted in divine revelation. In post-critical Christian theology, attitudes toward this phenomenon are undergoing considerable change. Once met with contempt and anxiety from Protestants and Roman Catholics alike, the idea of postcanonical doctrinal development nowadays meets with a far more favorable, even enthusiastic consent in both circles. Evangelicals, however, meet with the prospect of doctrinal development in the tension between two poles: an unwavering commitment to the supreme authority of God’s unchanging word (

  Abstract: Nietzsche is fundamentally concerned with the circuitous and deceptive character of our relations to things, and with the transcendence of actuality to our representations of it at the level of the signifier. But to a semiotician, the distinction between linguistic activity and extralinguistic reality is naive, and so I turn to Umberto Eco’s more doggedly semiotic approach to this distinction in

  Abstract: "In the Holocaust novel, silence is always a character, and the word is always its subject matter." So writes David Patterson in this profound and original study of more than thirty important writers. Contrary to existing views, he argues, the Holocaust novel is not an attempt to depict an unimaginable reality or an ineffable horror. It is, rather, an endeavor to fetch the word from silence and restore it to meaning, to resurrect the human soul, to regenerate the relation between the self and God, the self and other, the self and itself.<br>

The combination of diverse language codes in the work of Rodríguez, the blending of colloquial expressions and intertextual effects by Fuertes, and the detailed descriptions and transformations of Cabañero illustrate their transcendence of the pedestrian realism of many earlier post-Civil War writers.

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

Beyond this, the reality that these are key texts for the understanding of the Bible means that they have fundamental impact for the basics of faith today our understanding of ourselves before God, essential to faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Israel's prophets reflect on the role of God in human life; faith in God's love, God's passion for justice, the essential place of fidelity in faith. Israel's foundational narratives explore the nature of human lives before God; they include issues such as creation, human freedom, and faith in God's unshakeable commitment to human life. Alongside these concerns, there is the importance of getting a feel for the nature of scripture.<br>

  Book Title: Material Feminisms-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: Harnessing the energy of provocative theories generated by recent understandings of the human body, the natural world, and the material world, Material Feminisms presents an entirely new way for feminists to conceive of the question of materiality. In lively and timely essays, an international group of feminist thinkers challenges the assumptions and norms that have previously defined studies about the body. These wide-ranging essays grapple with topics such as the material reality of race, the significance of sexual difference, the impact of disability experience, and the complex interaction between nature and culture in traumatic events such as Hurricane Katrina. By insisting on the importance of materiality, this volume breaks new ground in philosophy, feminist theory, cultural studies, science studies, and other fields where the body and nature collide.<br>

Whether this aspiration is itself justifiable, however, is another question.

  Book Title: What Is Fiction For?-Literary Humanism Restored<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Harrison Bernard<br>
  Abstract: How can literature, which consists of nothing more than the description of imaginary events and situations, offer any insight into the workings of "human reality" or "the human condition"? Can mere words illuminate something that we call "reality"? Bernard Harrison answers these questions in this profoundly original work that seeks to re-enfranchise reality in the realms of art and discourse. In an ambitious account of the relationship between literature and cognition, he seeks to show how literary fiction, by deploying words against a background of imagined circumstances, allows us to focus on the roots, in social practice, of the meanings by which we represent our world and ourselves. Engaging with philosophers and theorists as diverse as Wittgenstein, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Derrida, F. R. Leavis, Cleanth Brooks, and Stanley Fish, and illustrating his ideas through readings of works by Swift, Woolf, Appelfeld, and Dickens, among others, this book presents a systematic defense of humanism in literary studies, and of the study of the Humanities more generally, by a distinguished scholar.<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D.

One discovers in these sources heretofore unsuspected dimensions that attune with the demands of liberation coming from everywhere. In the other, historical-social reality is illuminated with perspectives derived from faith, tradition, and the great theologians. There emerges the prophetic-denunciatory side of Christianity, its liberationist inspiration, and its unwavering utopian horizon, sustaining hope and utopias.<br>

While Birmingham certainly flirted with abstract structural Marxism, their interests lay more in the direction of the concrete, since they, unlike many Marxist sociologists, were trying to gain a purchase on reality in the street, so to speak – although one may have reservations about the nature of their ethnography, which, except for some of the research reports, was explicitly focused<br>

  Book Title: The Trouble with Community-Anthropological Reflections on Movement, Identity and Collectivity<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: 'Community' is one of social science's longest-standing concepts. The assumption, of much social science, has been that it is in communities -- and to communities -- that human individuals, as social and cultural beings, belong. Communities are said to embody that interactive environment from which individuals' identities and senses of self derive, and in which they continue to dwell. The trouble with 'community' is that this is not necessarily so; the personal social networks of individuals' actual experience crosscut collective categories, situations and institutions. Communities can prove unviable or imprisoning; the reality of community life and identity can often be very different from the ideology and the ideal. In this provocative new book, anthropologists Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport draw on their various ethnographic experiences to reappraise the concept and the reality of 'community', in the light of globalization, religious fundamentalism, identity politics, and renascent localisms. How might anthropology better apprehend social identities which are intrinsically plural, transgressive and ironic? What has anthropology to say about the way in which civil society might hope to accommodate the on-going construction and the rightful expression of such migrant identities? Nigel Rapport and Vered Amit give their own answers to these questions before entering into dialogue to assess each other's positions. Nigel Rapport is Professor of Anthropological and Philosophical Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is author of Transcendent Individual (1997). Vered Amit is an Associate Professor at Concordia University in Montreal. She is the editor of Realizing Community (2002).<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Abstract: In various places in Benjamin’s writing the divine is identified in the total passing away and disappearance of the phenomenal. Probably the most famous case for such annihilative characterization of the divine occurs in the essay “Critique of Violence.” Yet, the account of divine violence in that essay, with its intimation of active destruction, tempts one to construe the moment of disappearance in terms of catastrophic effects wrought by God on the physical world, on the model of a force that makes visible changes in reality. This problematic figuration of the catastrophic in Benjamin’s vision of history might hide a<br>

  Book Title: Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections. Most contributions refer to specifically historical phenomena and meaning-constructions. Some touch on the subjects of biographical memory and biographical constructions of reality. Of all the various affinities between the contributions collected here, the most important is their consistent attention to issues of the constitution and representation of temporal experience.<br>

  Author(s) Welzer Harald<br>
  Abstract: Until now, psychology has barely dealt with the topics of historical consciousness and historical thought. Although the discipline has given thorough attention to other forms of thought—to other forms of the construction of reality—there is no distinctive tradition with the theoretical or clinical objective of establishing a psychology of specifically historical acts of meaning-construction. Seen properly, this is astonishing. Psychology is commonly considered one of the key modern sciences that aspire to investigate as well as to shape our relationships to others and to the world from a genetic, structural, and functional perspective. However, a generally acknowledged characteristic<br>

  Abstract: Within the field of cultural studies discussions on the relationship between researcher and the subject(s) of research in recent years have mainly been held under the heading of ‘representation.’ The term, as it has generally been applied, is founded on an epistemological assumption: the notion of knowledge as the mirror of reality. This notion itself is based on a concept of objectivity which introduces a categorical separation between reality and its description or analysis, and thus gets into the problem of the adequacy of representation and its correspondence to the object depicted. The theory of knowledge involved in this conception<br>

  Abstract: Transformative work against segregation and racial oppression must directly confront racism and the social construction of race. Whiteness and blackness are not merely mirror images of each other. “White” does not only mean “opposite of Other” but also stands for the dominant, transparent norm that defines what attributes of race should be counted, how to count them, and who (as in white employers or mortgage bankers) gets to do the counting. Therefore, destabilizing “Other” -ness doesn’t entirely destabilize the dominance of whiteness. Even though race has no natural reality or truth, it has great social force. More work is required,<br>

  Abstract: The most persuasive moment of Paul Ricoeur’s work for the development anthropologist is his idea of narrative imagination. This concept, applied to the development act of working together with the other who faces marginalization, fear, famine, and isolation, provides a medium for both the anthropologist and the local to emplot history and fiction into a social reality that brings each to a new place. Far from static, this new place is an emerging plot that enables movement from shame and hunger to selfsustainability on the part of the local, and movement from the confinement of Western individualism to an ontological<br>

When in modernity science came into a dominant position, religion was categorized in accordance with its nonscientific nature, given that the transcendental reality to which it refers is not open to empirical verification.

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

  Abstract: Few questions exert such a great fascination on human conscience as those related to the meaning of life, history, and death. The belief in the resurrection of the dead constitutes an answer to a real challenge: What is the meaning of life and history in the midst of a world in which evil, injustice, and ultimately death exist? Resurrection is an instrument serving a broader, more encompassing reality: the Kingdom of God. Such a utopian Kingdom gathers the final response to the problem of theodicy and to the enigma of history. <CR><CR> This book seeks to understand the idea of resurrection not only as a theological but also as a philosophical category (as expression of the collective aspirations of humanity), combining historical, theological, and philosophical analyses in dialogue with some of the principal streams of contemporary Western thought.<br>

  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

This can be experienced in what Peirce calls the category of “Firstness.” Following Peirce, the contemplation of reality in the immediate experience of its quality (Firstness) is a phenomenological task.

  Book Title: Sacramental Presence after Heidegger-Onto-theology, Sacraments, and the Mother's Smile<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Conor<br>
  Abstract: "Theology after Heidegger must take into account history and language as elements in the pursuit of meaning. Quite often, this prompts a hurried flight from metaphysics to an embrace of an absence at the center of Christian narrativity. Conor Sweeney here explores the “postmodern" critique of presence in the context of sacramental theology, engaging the thought of Louis-Marie Chauvet and Lieven Boeve. Chauvet is an influential postmodern theologian whose critique of the perceived onto-theological constitution of presence in traditional sacramental theology has made big waves, while Boeve is part of a more recent generation of theologians who even more wholeheartedly embrace postmodern consequences for theology. Sweeney considers the extent to which postmodernism à la Heidegger upsets the hermeneutics of sacramentality, asking whether this requires us to renounce the search for a presence that by definition transcends us. Against both the fetishization of presence and absence, Sweeney argues that metaphysics has a properly sacramental basis, and that it is only through this reality that the dialectic of presence and absence can be transcended. The case is made for the full but restless signification of the mother’s smile as the paradigm for genuine sacramental presence."<br>

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

The senior missionary arrived and made a plan for baptism on the following day. During the night the tribal council had a serious discussion, and then sent a message of regret<br>

This leads to a particular dialectical understanding of ethical judgment and action.

The Christian symbol of divine suffering naturally exhibits that threefold referentiality in both the explicit symbol and its twofold presupposition.

  Abstract: In the last two decades, quantitative methods of analyzing historical sources seem to have lost much of their appeal in Canadian and American immigration historiography, reflecting a trend common to social historians in general. Historians on both sides of the border have largely abandoned analyzing international population movements from a macrohistorical perspective in favour of studying local immigrant neighbourhoods through the prism of ethnicity/race, class, and gender.¹ Influenced by the postmodernist critique of historical objectivity and the knowability of the past, academic scholars are becoming increasingly sceptical of seeing population statistics and other serial datasets as windows on past reality.<br>

To teach the reality of social class as both a literary trope and a socio-political category, in other words, raises issues concerning, not solely pedagogy or social hierarchy, but personal agency, identity politics, and subject formation.

On the other hand, trauma can adversely affect cognition. Memories can be fixed that do not necessarily coincide with physical reality. This does not mean that eyewitnesses are acting<br>

  Book Title: Science Fiction Double Feature-The Science Fiction Film as Cult Text<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUCHOVNAY GERALD<br>
  Abstract: Critical discussion of cult cinema has often noted its tendency to straddle or ignore boundaries, to pull together different sets of conventions, narrative formulas, or character types for the almost surreal pleasure to be found in their sudden juxtapositions or narrative combination. With its own boundary-blurring nature—as both science and fiction, reality and fantasy—science fiction has played a key role in such cinematic cult formation. This volume examines that largely unexplored relationship, looking at how the sf film’s own double nature neatly matches up with a persistent double vision common to the cult film. It does so by bringing together an international array of scholars to address key questions about the intersections of sf and cult cinema: how different genre elements, directors, and stars contribute to cult formation; what role fan activities, including “con" participation, play in cult development; and how the occulted or “bad" sf cult film works. The volume pursues these questions by addressing a variety of such sf cult works, including Robot Monster (1953), Zardoz (1974), A Boy and His Dog (1975), Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989), Space Truckers (1996), Ghost in the Shell 2 (2004), and Iron Sky (2012). What these essays afford is a revealing vision of both the sf aspects of much cult film activity and the cultish aspects of the whole sf genre.<br>

The concept of habitus incorporates this idea since it shows that individual agency and its self-understanding are constituted by relying on an acquired social sense, the cognitive habitus, which defines how an agent<br>

The word that sparks this essay is “retained” rather than the inherently grander claims of Brodsky’s statement, claims that one can only fully understand and relate to the traditions of Russian poetry, instead of the slightly more moderate preoccupations of contemporary poetry in English. For “retained” read “memory,” the bulwark of the individual mind, or poetic imagination, in the act<br>

  Abstract: “Sound,” the American composer Morton Feldman wrote, “does not know its history” (2000, 22). Feldman’s statement captures a particularly modernist approach to the material aspect of art: in the case of music, sound is to be encountered as a thing in itself, without any immediate connection to exterior meaning or reality. The desire for the experience of pure artistic form implies its converse, also desired, in which art is experienced as an object in time, linked to tradition and occasion. To set these two aspects of artistic experience against one another is the hallmark of the modern sensibility. Modernity, as<br>

  Abstract: As Rosemarie Garland-Thomson writes, “Seeing disability as a representational system engages several premises of current critical theory: that representation structures reality, that the margins constitute the center, that human identity is multiple and unstable, and that all analysis and evaluation has political implications” (1997b, 19). With this in mind, I will pause here to create a quick overview of some of the myths of disability that are ubiquitous across cultures and eras and that condition our understanding of disability (and thus of all identity and all bodies).

  Abstract: Drama, novelty, friction, irregularity, upheaval, radical discontinuity, abrupt metamorphosis, revolutionary transformations – these also occur, in nature as well as in human affairs. For that reason, the old twofold distinction between ‘continuity’ and ‘change’ is inadequate to ‘shape’ the whole of history. Instead, the different forms of transformation need to be assessed separately. ‘Change’, which sounds unitary, is in reality highly diversified, as the previous chapter has argued. There are many forms of transformation, from the micro-changes that form ‘evolution’ to the macro-changes that form ‘revolution’.<br>

  Abstract: In a highly unusual combination of critical theory and analytic philosophy, the author sees all literary work, from novels to poems, as a strategy to contain a reality that seeks to thwart that containment, and in doing so throws up new problems that the work tries to resolve. The "event" of literature, Eagleton argues, consists in this continual transformative encounter, unique and endlessly repeatable. Freewheeling through centuries of critical ideas, he sheds light on the place of literature in our culture, and in doing so reaffirms the value and validity of literary thought today.<br>

  Book Title: Absorbing Perfections-Kabbalah and Interpretation<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

Homage is paid to the curious reality of human reproductive physiology—a fetus with ovaries is born containing their entire life’s supply of “eggs” (Moore, Persaud, and Torchia 269).

  Abstract: Argentine classical films illustrate the reality of a nation built through the efforts of immigrants, who wanted for their children a better life in the young Argentina of the early nineteenth century. In these films, a mother’s role is clear and unambiguous: to sacrifice herself for the sake of her children—even giving her own life if necessary—so that they could be promoted in social, economic, and cultural ways. However, in the1980s, with the return of democracy in Argentina and Latin America, a break happened in the hegemonic discourse of the stereotypical ideal mother figure (as well as the<br>

  Abstract: Before further engagement with Panikkar’s thought, it is important to note one problem presented by the reality that Panikkar’s large body of writing spans a period in excess of fifty years: any attempted summary or survey is difficult, given the evolving nature of his thought. The difficulty is compounded by one of the logically prior challenges of making sense of Panikkar: the idiosyncratic relationship between the publishing dates of Panikkar’s books and other writings and the actual genesis of their content. At times, this makes it difficult to understand the development of Panikkar’s thought, even about a single issue. Nonetheless,<br>

                  The Fire Next Time(1963), Baldwin speculated that fear of death was one of the wellsprings of not only white supremacy but all forms of racial, religious, and national chauvinism: “Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies,<br>

  Book Title: Negative Cosmopolitanism-Cultures and Politics of World Citizenship after Globalization<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): TOMSKY TERRI<br>
  Abstract: From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective. In the twentieth century the world sought solutions through formal institutions of international governance such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the World Bank, but present-day responses to global realities are often more provisional, improvisational, and contingent. Tracing this uneven history in order to identify principal actors, contesting ideologies, and competing rhetoric, Negative Cosmopolitanism challenges the Kantian ideal of cosmopolitanism as the precondition for a perpetual global peace. Uniting literary scholars with researchers working on contemporary problems and those studying related issues of the past – including slavery, industrial capitalism, and corporate imperialism – essays in this volume scrutinize the entanglement of cosmopolitanism within expanding networks of trade and global capital from the eighteenth century to the present. By doing so, the contributors pinpoint the ways in which whole populations have been unwillingly caught up in a capitalist reality that has little in common with the earlier ideals of cosmopolitanism. A model for provoking new and necessary questions about neoliberalism, biopolitics, colonialism, citizenship, and xenophobia, Negative Cosmopolitanism establishes a fresh take on the representation of globalization and modern life in history and literature.

  Book Title: Spiritual Grammar-Genre and the Saintly Subject in Islam and Christianity<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Thatamanil John<br>
  Abstract: Spiritual Grammar identifies a genre of religious literature that until now has not been recognized as such. In this surprising and theoretically nuanced study, F. Dominic Longo reveals how grammatical structures of language addressed in two medieval texts published nearly four centuries apart, from distinct religious traditions, offer a metaphor for how the self is embedded in spiritual reality. Reading The Grammar of Hearts (Nahw al-qulūb) by the great Sufi shaykh and Islamic scholar 'Abd al-Karīm al-Qushayrī (d. 1074) and Moralized Grammar (Donatus moralizatus) by Christian theologian Jean Gerson (d. 1429), Longo reveals how both authors use the rules of language and syntax to advance their pastoral goals. Indeed, grammar provides the two masters with a fresh way of explaining spiritual reality to their pupils and to discipline the souls of their readers in the hopes that their writings would make others adept in the grammar of the heart.<br>

In this chapter, we introduce the “linguistic turn” and then follow the course of Ricoeur’s exegetical works to gain an appreciation of how his general theory of metaphoricity relates specifically to religious discourse: that is, the way in which the scriptural naming of God functions<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 1 I offered a typology of religious representation—unitive, enactive, symbolic, and conceptual—to describe the ways in which religions have understood reality. The concepts of enactive, symbolic, and conceptual representation were adapted from the work of Jerome Bruner on child development. According to Bruner, who is in turn adapting his categories from Piaget, the child first learns about the world by acting on it. It is by holding, throwing, reaching for, that the children come to know the objects that surround them. In early language learning the symbol and the object are fused—the sun and the<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

  Abstract: Biblical scholars have long noted the anti-docetic overtones of John’s Gospel.

(From the Greek δoκέω, “to seem,” docetism, which was the first great challenge to Christological faith, alleges that Christ only

  Abstract: Gaps between global ideals of HIV/AIDS prevention and the reality of local initiatives have been widely noted. Globally sanctioned interventions such as promoting rational decision making around sex, and the ABC model (Abstinence, Be faithful, and use Condoms), draw from behaviour models that regard sexual behaviour as risky when it deviates from narrowly defined norms. Assumptions about reasoned sexual practice are rooted in conceptions of human behaviour that assume individuals can and do routinely assess risks from a narrow rationalistic point of view, and modify their behaviour accordingly. When rational sex is put into practice, cracks show up almost immediately,<br>

  Abstract: The challenge of the Truth Matters conference call to “reclaim truthfulness for the academic enterprise” underscores that a commitment to truth is not an abstract principle but a concrete action. As Plato recognizes, philosopher-rulers need not only “the ability to grasp eternal and immutable truth” but also certain “qualities of character”; in describing these, he begins with “love of the knowledge that reveals eternal reality” and follows immediately with “truthfulness” – for how could “a love of wisdom and a love of falsehood” possibly coexist in one person?¹ Character thus connotes integrity, because virtuous traits are complementary and coherent.<br>

  Abstract: The development of explicit hermeneutical reflection bears the signature of modernity. As shown above with reference to Nietzsche and Habermas, what distinguishes the modern world-picture is its consciousness of being perspectival. As soon as it becomes evident that worldviews do not merely duplicate reality as it is in itself, but are instead pragmatic interpretations embraced by our language-world, then hermeneutics comes into its own. Only with the advent of modernity has this occurred. For this reason, it is hardly accidental that the Latin word

  Book Title: Moral Evil-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

Nevertheless, Annette Wieviorka, in her study of testimonies of the immediate post-war period – of which there are a surprisingly large number – notes in response to this error that it ‘makes no difference to the insane scale of the massacre’.²<br>

  Abstract: A very general answer, that I think everybody can agree on, to the question of what a semantics is, is that it specifies a relation between linguistic expressions and the referents of the expressions. But soon afterwards, opinions diverge. There is, in particular, no agreement on what kind of entities the meanings of various words are. Some say that the referents of language are things in the world, some say they are things, but maybe not in this world, and some say they are mental constructions without any posit that these constructions coalesce with reality.<br>

  Abstract: Metaphysics can be described as the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of being, existence, and reality. Epistemology, another fundamental branch of philosophy, is intimately tied to metaphysics because it deals with the nature of knowledge: to talk about what is, one must speak of knowing what is, just as one cannot know something is without also positing that it is. The central questions of metaphysics are, What is it? and How is it? and they necessarily involve, How do I know this? or Can I know that?

For that historical reason, aesthetics is not just “art theory,” as it articulates both more general and more particular issues, for instance: perception through the senses, the definition of beauty, judgment of taste, the truth content of an artwork and its relationship to (physical, psychological, economic etc.) reality, the questions of originality and newness; eventually, the definition and the very possibility of “art” itself, which becomes a serious matter<br>

Repetition’s operation ofsimilitudeurges consistency over time, emphasizing the reality of things and of persons, as when we speak of habits, customs, conventions. While some repetition is necessary for narrative stability, it can also afford uncertainty because every iteration can seem to bear more—or different—meaning in its new context.

  Abstract: While postcolonial discourse in the Caribbean has drawn attention to colonialism's impact on space and spatial hierarchy, Stanka Radović asks both how ordinary people as "users" of space have been excluded from active and autonomous participation in shaping their daily spatial reality and how they challenge this exclusion. In a comparative interdisciplinary reading of anglophone and francophone Caribbean literature and contemporary spatial theory, she focuses on the house as a literary figure and the ways that fiction and acts of storytelling resist the oppressive hierarchies of colonial and neocolonial domination. The author engages with the theories of Henri Lefebvre, Michel Foucault, and contemporary critical geographers, in addition to selected fiction by V. S. Naipaul, Patrick Chamoiseau, Beryl Gilroy, and Rafaël Confiant, to examine the novelists' construction of narrative "houses" to reclaim not only actual or imaginary places but also the very conditions of self-representation.<br>

Under the influence of Platonist and Aristotelian paradigms, mimesis has been a crux of debate between proponents of what Halliwell calls "world-reflecting" and "world-simulating" theories of representation in both the visual and musico-poetic arts. This debate is about not only the fraught relationship between art and reality but also the psychology and ethics of how we experience and are affected by mimetic art.<br>

This was a result of the fact that the peasantry’s primary social institutions—the family and the commune—were authoritarian, cultivating, through socialization, authoritarian personalities.

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  Abstract: The modern Western tradition of utopian writing, rooted in More’s

Although this mentality has been variously characterized, one of its firm bases is the epistemological concern for verifiable ways of knowing and measuring reality. Tracing the beginnings of this way of thinking in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the comparatist Timothy J.

This distinction is evident in the early poetry, where Eliot places highly conventional personae in contexts that evoke a deeper reality of which they are unaware. It is also a feature of the<br>

The second section offers in-depth case study analyses of France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, and the United States. This book is an international project led by three members of the Research Group on Plurinational Societies based at Université du Québec à Montréal. Contributors include James Bickerton (St-Francis Xavier University), Ángel Castiñeira (ESADE - Escuela superior de administración y dirección de empresas), John Coakley (University College Dublin), Alain Dieckhoff (Institut d’études politiques, Paris), Louis Dupont (Sorbonne University), Enric Fossas (Unversitat Autònoma de Barcelona), Alain-G.

  Abstract: While the plays that follow the tragedies and conclude Shakespeare’s career seem to belong to a different world from the tragedies, the differences do not eradicate some fundamental social continuities. The romances still observe Renaissance social decorum, bestowing the most serious roles on the social elite and depicting them in greater numbers than their inferiors, in defiance of Jacobean social reality. In contrast to the tragedies, redemptive symbols in the late plays are vindicated, and hard won self-knowledge is cherished by cosmic hope. Yet the spiritually ennobling process we witness in the romances is largely confined to the upper classes,<br>

  Abstract: The question of self-identity, Who am I?, is an enduring theme in human reality. When one connects this question of Who am I? to the question of Who are we?, one forms a politics of identity. The question as to how and where people as groups construct and express the identity that holds them together is more complex than it appears on the surface. Identity politics has made tremendous contributions for the marginalized groups: raising self-awareness and self-dignity; challenging through politicization the mainstream claim to hegemonic power; providing spaces to claim their voices and experiences as legitimate; and empowering both<br>

This hidden predicament lies in the fact that cosmology is being constructed from within the

While previously arguing that theological accounts of freedom and subjectivity must be cast in reference to the sovereignty of God, more must be said about the possibility of subjectivity for those made objects by normative “mankind.” In this regard, the emergence of feminist Pentecostal studies poses a sharp challenge to both systematic theology and gender studies. The experiences of Pentecostal women, often in non-Western contexts, confront common assumptions regarding women’s ritual experience and the emergence of subjectivity.<br>

Competing visions of history, I suggest, have always been integral to conceptions of self-identity and relationship to the “other,” in individual and communal interactions.

  Author(s) Fernandez James W.<br>
  Abstract: There is a kind of rhetorical functioning in the disorderly zones of human life, which sustains and transforms the persons involved. Linguistic operations at the edges of disorder appear as we engage our human deceptive and imaginative abilities, our abilities to produce alternatives, to resist what we learn is expected of us. In these zones, discomfort with the limits of our own cultures motivates tropological experiments, ‘the sleight of hand at the limit of a text’, as Voloshinov wrote. Here especially, the rhetorics of emotion work to transform socioemotional reality, having a critical and often unwitting impact on social life.<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Feminine Poetics in the Works of a Late-20th-Century Catalan Woman Poet: Maria-Mercè Marçal-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Vicedo Noelia Díaz<br>
  Abstract: This study focuses upon the work of the Catalan woman poet Maria-Mercè Marçal. It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.<br>

  Book Title: America's Education Deficit and the War on Youth-Reform Beyond Electoral Politics<br>
  Publisher: Monthly Review Press<br>
  Author(s): GIROUX HENRY A.<br>
  Abstract: America's latest war, according to renowned social critic Henry Giroux, is a war on youth. While this may seem counterintuitive in our youth-obsessed culture, Giroux lays bare the grim reality of how our educational, social, and economic institutions continually fail young people. Their systemic failure is the result of what Giroux identifies as four fundamentalisms: market deregulation, patriotic and religious fervor, the instrumentalization of education, and the militarization of society. We see the consequences most plainly in the decaying education system: schools are increasingly designed to churn out drone-like future employees, imbued with authoritarian values, inured to violence, and destined to serve the market. And those are the lucky ones. Young people who don't conform to cultural and economic discipline are left to navigate the neoliberal landscape on their own; if they are black or brown, they are likely to become ensnared by a harsh penal system.Giroux sets his sights on the war on youth and takes it apart, examining how a lack of access to quality education, unemployment, the repression of dissent, a culture of violence, and the discipline of the market work together to shape the dismal experiences of so many young people. He urges critical educators to unite with students and workers in rebellion to form a new pedagogy, and to build a new, democratic society from the ground up. Here is a book you won't soon forget, and a call that grows more urgent by the day.<br>

  Abstract: The critique of modernism that so preoccupies contemporary architectural discourse has entailed a fundamental re-interpretation of the history of Western architecture.

It was found that until very recently,

  Author(s) Taiana Cecilia<br>
  Abstract: THE NOTION OF “CROSSROADS,” which in Spanish also has the figurative meaning of “dilemma” is associated with another closely related word, “labyrinth,” which in present times implies a pathway through a literary universe where Kafka, Borges, Hawthorne and Octavio Paz, author of
                  The Labyrinth of Solitude,all serve as guides. I believe that as writers and poets become aware of their vocation, they discover a different world—of words, of the imagination—and that this discovery makes them appear strange to other people. They are perceived as having failed to adjust to a reality that is too harsh or alien<br>

  Abstract: Friedrich Nietzscheʹs famous lapidary dictum ʹThere are no facts, only interpretationsʹ summarizes his vastly influential assertion that if an objective reality exists, the perspectival nature of human cognition renders that reality inaccessible. War, according to Lev Tolstoyʹs
                  War and Peace(1869), reveals that incapacity as deriving at least partly from the two extremes of proximity and remoteness: both Nikolai Rostovoʹs complete submersion in the immediacy of battle and Napoleonʹs distant, hence more abstract, viewpoint hamper their powers of perception. The two radically contrasting subject/ive positions are equally disabling for, in the complex, chaotic circumstances of war no such vantage point<br>

  Abstract: All the existentialists believe that, in this century, the human reality has been degraded more than ever before, and because of this, it has become very difficult for people to see the meaning of human life. The rapid development of techniques has tended to force men to lose their self-respect and become waste-products, despairing of life both intellectually and vitally. In the Nazi concentration camps, not only were the material conditions designed to turn men into beasts, but also the encouragement of suspicion and distrust turned brothers into enemies and devils.

Nevertheless, we can see many of the diverse movements and figures of the modernist breakthrough as sharing a concern to achieve a decisively unambiguous life, piercing through the superficial compromises of bourgeois society, looking reality in the face, and affirming the truth of iving personality.

  Abstract: In recent decades, many Italian filmmakers have been turning to the documentary medium in response to the lack of commitment by public and private broadcasters to the production of programmes of cultural significance (Bertozzi 2008: 305). Unfortunately, the contestable funding available for their production (mostly local, regional or special interest) is limited, as is documentary distribution beyond the festival circuit. The emergence and evolution of the web documentary has provided an opportunity for new channels of distribution and increasingly foregrounds the role of the user/viewer in their engagement, interaction and negotiation with the reality documented.

  Abstract: Europe did not discover America, but America was quite a discovery for Europe. For roughly three centuries before the American Revolution, the ideas that made the American Revolution possible were being discovered, nurtured and embellished in the growing English and French colonies of North America. America provided a counterpoint for European convention and assumption. It became, for Europeans in America, at once a dream and a reality, a fact and a fantasy, the real and the ideal.

Not surprisingly, this extends as far back as Plato and Aristotle as well as being found in the more recent philosophical thinking of writers as diverse as Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), Henri Bergson (1859–1941) and Walter Benjamin (1892–1940).

  Abstract: In this essay I will explore the eco-philosophical aspects of the ethics of becoming, with reference to the project of nomadic subjectivity and sustainability. The urge that prompts this investigation is not only abstract, but also very practical. Nomadic philosophy mobilises one’s affectivity and enacts the desire for in-depth transformations in the status of the kind of subjects we have become. Such in-depth changes, however, are at best demanding and at worst painful processes. My political generation, that of the baby-boomers, has had to come to terms with this harsh reality, which put a check on the intense and often<br>

The prospect of psychological disintegration, manifesting itself in the worst cases in schizophrenic illness, is, in Deleuze’s conception of writing, an ever-present threat.

  Abstract: Gadamer’s critique of aesthetic subjectivity insists that, phenomenologically speaking, an involvement with art demonstrates that the experience of meaning has primacy over the experience of aesthetic properties. If meaning results from the conveyance of significance within bodies of semantic relations (which Gadamer describes collectively as linguisticality), meaning’s mode of being, whether visual or literary, is
                  presentational. With characteristic restraint, this simple move in Gadamer’s aesthetics prompts a major ontological shift in thinking about the ancient but nonetheless continuingly contentious question of art’s relation to reality.

  Abstract: This chapter sets out the theoretical model for the book: a model explaining the conditioned power of theories. In order to establish my theory, I aim to use hermeneutics—though with a slight twist. Hermeneutics is usually understood as the art of reading and interpreting texts. I want to stress, however, the dual nature of hermeneutics. Although hermeneutics indeed interprets texts, it is also a more active intellectual endeavor of interpreting reality once reality is conceived as an unwritten text. That is not to say that reality is nothing but a text or even to claim it is a text<br>

  Abstract: Diverse archival aims mirror diverse uses of the past in general. At one extreme are disinterested efforts to learn and understand what has actually happened; at the other, partisan zeal to fabricate a past that suits present needs—to forge an identity, to secure a legacy, to validate a conquest or a claim, to prove a preeminence. The role of archives in these contrary goals is symptomatic, indeed, crucial.

  Abstract: In engaging the tension between perspectives that challenge traditional gender stereotypes and those that reiterate normative conventions, feminist readers encounter a set of more nuanced methodological and theoretical considerations. At the outset, it is imperative to situate Ibn ʿArabī’s teachings on gender within the assumptions of his worldview—that is, to take seriously the Sufi framework of his engagement with gender. As is characteristic of all Ibn ʿArabī’s works, paradox, ambivalence, and contradiction are part of his mystical methodology.

  Abstract: As an abolitionist orator during the 1840s, Frederick Douglass confronted his audiences with the presence and power of a body that Garrison, in his capacity as editor of
                  The Liberator,could have only approximated. It was Douglass who appeared as the representative of abolition principles through and in bodily form; it was Douglass’s body that audiences acclaimed when they embraced abolitionist rhetoric. Standing before largely white audiences, the black orator composed a physical force, a corporeal reality that they sought to measure and put into words. James Russell Lowell spoke for others when he declared, “The very look and bearing<br>

In
                  No Future, he contends, “the image of the Child, not to be confused with the lived experiences of any historical children, serves to regulate political discourse—to prescribe what willcountas political discourse—by compelling such discourse to accede in advance to the reality of a collective future<br>

  Abstract: Techniques and strategies of visual simulation are shaping the contemporary landscape of international politics. Placing the interpretive focus of critical/postmodern international relations theory on the UN and its peacekeeping operations allows one to realize that, in a post–cold war era, techniques such as panopticism, visual suture, clinical witnessing, or photojournalistic displays of the other’s gaze are crucial international mechanisms. It is through such visually and mediatically enhanced strategies that both reality and ideology (and reality as ideology) are accessed. In the current practice of international affairs, the strategy of simulation seeks to “fool the eye” of the international observer,<br>

  Abstract: If the producers of the so-called reality TV shows have any say in defining reality, Jean Baudrillard and Michel Foucault are not merely towering figures of postmodern thought; they are the true prophets of this young millennium. By placing human subjects under the never-ending surveillance of cameras, and by labeling the resulting spectacle reality, these shows seem to have been conceived for the specific purpose of implementing Foucault’s dystopic vision of a panoptic society, and Baudrillard’s doctrine of the (hyper) reality of the image in contemporary culture.

  Abstract: Chapter 4 of

According to Husserl, even when I talk to myself there is no genuine communication and thus no indication: I merely imagine or represent myself as speaking and communicating. This is Derrida’s opportunity to investigate the role of representation in language. “Representation” has a variety of senses, and Derrida argues that through all the registers of its meaning, the “fundamental distinction between reality and representation” cannot be drawn, since in language it is impossible to distinguish them.<br>

In this chapter I will focus on Koselleck’s largely negative assessment of the ways in which the problem of politics versus morality has been addressed in Enlightenment thought. Koselleck’s model<br>

Essays incorporate the evolving conception of the soul and the afterlife in pre- and post-Buddhist China, the significance of eating practices and social etiquette, the move toward greater individualism, the rise of the Neo-Daoist movement, the spread of Confucian ethics, and the growth of merchant culture and capitalism.

Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  Book Title: Why Only Art Can Save Us-Aesthetics and the Absence of Emergency<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ZABALA SANTIAGO<br>
  Abstract: The state of emergency, according to thinkers such as Carl Schmidt, Walter Benjamin, and Giorgio Agamben, is at the heart of any theory of politics. But today the problem is not the crises that we do confront, which are often used by governments to legitimize themselves, but the ones that political realism stops us from recognizing as emergencies, from widespread surveillance to climate change to the systemic shocks of neoliberalism. We need a way of disrupting the existing order that can energize radical democratic action rather than reinforcing the status quo. In this provocative book, Santiago Zabala declares that in an age where the greatest emergency is the absence of emergency, only contemporary art's capacity to alter reality can save us.
      Why Only Art Can Save Usadvances a new aesthetics centered on the nature of the emergency that characterizes the twenty-first century. Zabala draws on Martin Heidegger's distinction between works of art that rescue us from emergency and those that are rescuersintoemergency. The former are a means of cultural politics, conservers of the status quo that conceal emergencies; the latter are disruptive events that thrust us into emergencies. Building on Arthur Danto, Jacques Rancière, and Gianni Vattimo, who made aesthetics more responsive to contemporary art, Zabala argues that works of art are not simply a means of elevating consumerism or contemplating beauty but are points of departure to change the world. Radical artists create works that disclose and demand active intervention in ongoing crises. Interpreting works of art that aim to propel us into absent emergencies, Zabala shows how art's ability to create new realities is fundamental to the politics of radical democracy in the state of emergency that is the present.<br>

Works of art, like events and emergencies, have become remnants of Being, that is, ontological or existential alterations that aim to shake our logical, ethical, and aesthetic assessments of reality. These alterations take place at the margins of culture because they represent not only a resistance to its values but also, as Heidegger<br>

  Abstract: Truth, reference, and meaning have traditionally been the three central notions in philosophical semantics. In the preceding two chapters we dealt with the question of the role to be assigned to reference and truth in (historical) representation. We found that representations cannot be said to refer to the world in the way proper names and sentences do, though they can be characterized as self-referential. Similarly, the notion of truth can meaningfully be used in the context of representation, not in the sense of propositional truth but in the quasi-Heideggerian sense of truth as a revelation of a past reality.

  Book Title: Secret Police Files from the Eastern Bloc-Between Surveillance and Life Writing<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Petrescu Corina L.<br>
  Abstract: The communist secret police services of Central and Eastern Europe kept detailed records not only of their victims but also of the vast networks of informants and collaborators upon whom their totalitarian systems depended. These records, now open to the public in many former Eastern Bloc countries, reflect a textually mediated reality that has defined and shaped the lives of former victims and informers, creating a tension between official records and personal memories. Exploring this tension between a textually and technically mediated past and the subject/victim's reclaiming and retrospective interpretation of that past in biography is the goal of this volume. While victims' secret police files have often been examined as a type of unauthorized archival life writing, the contributors to this volume are among the first to analyze the fragmentary and sometimes remedial nature of these biographies and to examine the subject/victims' rewriting and remediation of them in various creative forms. Essays focus, variously, on the files of the East German Stasi, the Romanian Securitate (in relation to Transylvanian Germans in Romania), and the Hungarian State Security Agency. Contributors: Carol Anne Costabile-Heming, Ulrike Garde, Valentina Glajar, Yuliya Komska, Alison Lewis, Corina L. Petrescu, Annie Ring, Aniko Szucs.

  Abstract: In the following chapter, a brief critical history of the main tenets of feminist theory relevant to this book will be outlined. This will include an analysis of Anglo-American, French, and Spanish feminism. Each movement will be examined with reference to the political and social climate in which they emerged, the basic tenets shaping each movement and the strengths and weaknesses they possess. An understanding of the development of feminist criticism is essential if one is to appreciate the growth of literature by women in Spain, and thus, the work of Josefina Aldecoa, whose writing captures the reality of womanhood<br>

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world. Genese Grill holds a PhD in Germanic Literatures and Languages from the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br>

  Abstract: In the first chapter, I studied the various ways in which a narrator produces a magical realist effect in the text. One important point that emerged from the passages being analysed was the centrality of communal belief for adopting a perspective upon reality that is regarded as valid. Disbelievers are frowned upon while storytellers are seen to embellish and exaggerate their accounts on many occasions. The confusion that arises for the reader creates the impression that two points of view upon a given reality are battling with one another.

  Book Title: Representing the "Good German" in Literature and Culture after 1945-Altruism and Moral Ambiguity<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War, both the allied occupying powers and the nascent German authorities sought Germans whose record during the war and the Nazi period could serve as a counterpoint to the notion of Germans as evil. That search has never really stopped. In the past few years, we have witnessed a burgeoning of cultural representations of this "other" kind of Third Reich citizen - the "good German" - as opposed to the committed Nazi or genocidal maniac. Such representations have highlighted individuals' choices in favor of dissenting behavior, moral truth, or at the very least civil disobedience. The "good German's" counterhegemonic practice cannot negate or contradict the barbaric reality of Hitler's Germany, but reflects a value system based on humanity and an "other" ideal community. This volume of new essays explores postwar and recent representations of "good Germans" during the Third Reich, analyzing the logic of moral behavior, cultural and moral relativism, and social conformity found in them. It thus draws together discussions of the function and reception of "Good Germans" in Germany and abroad.

  Book Title: Expressing Identities in the Basque Arena-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Allen N.J.<br>
  Abstract: Everyday nationalism, the human and cultural aspects of identity, is a neglected subject in the literature on nationalism in Europe. Jeremy MacClancy redresses the balance in this unusual and sharp book on the human and cultural aspects of the idea of being Basque in the modern world. The style is fresh and colloquial, dealing with several of the kinds of issues that usually appear in popular magazines - cuisine, football, art and graffiti - but the treatment is serious and illustrative of underlying currents in social life. MacClancy argues that the ethnographic understanding of nationalisms, rather than the orthodox studies of ideology, political parties, social classes and centre-periphery clashes - offers a more nuanced comprehension of the lived reality of people in areas where nationalism is a significant force. This is very much nationalism from the bottom up. JEREMY MACCLANCY is Professor of Social Anthropology at Oxford Brookes University. Series editors: Wendy James & Nick Allen<br>

If one definition of anthropology is to take people seriously, then it behoves us to listen to what locals are saying and to attend to what they are doing.

  Book Title: Dialogic Aspects in the Cuban Novel of the 1990s-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DORADO-OTERO ÁNGELA<br>
  Abstract: This book examines six Cuban novels published between 1991 and 1999, all part of the new "boom" of the Cuban novel in the 1990s. It analyses how in undermining monolithic representations of reality these texts employ discursive techniques that question absolute truths, defy established boundaries of literary genres and challenge concepts of national, gender and individual identity. The authors studied in this book---Reinaldo Arenas, Leonardo Padura Fuentes, Abilio Estévez, Daína Chaviano, Yanitzia Canetti, and Zoé Valdés---are placed beyond the dichotomy of outside and inside Cuba in order to focus on the fluidity and heterogeneity of Cuban culture displayed in its literature. This study establishes similarities and differences in the way these authors create polyphonic texts that question whether notions of country and nation coincide in novels that respond to economic hardship, political and social changes, issues of cubanía, and exile.

  Abstract: The title “father of modern philosophy” (
                  modernin the sense of “not ancient”) is usually ascribed to the Frenchman René Descartes (1596–1650). By introducing mathematical methods into philosophy, Descartes founded the rationalist tradition in epistemology (the theory of knowledge and its objects), which holds that all knowledge of reality is ultimately derived from the exercise of human reason according to foundational principles independent of the senses. The rationalist position, which in Germany was taken up by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), Christian Wolff (1679–1754), and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–62), gave philosophical underpinnings to the European intellectual movement<br>

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

  Abstract: Schmidt’s play with non-phonetic signs and the etym theory illustrate his fragmentary style of writing and highlights his rejection of traditional logical chains of reasoning. Instead of presenting any dogmatic truths about language, Schmidt sought to animate the reader to create his or her language through self-conscious figuration. Although the etym language might suggest a rather confining way of reading and reflecting upon language and reality, the fact is that even Schmidt, as the self-proclaimed creator of such a mode of inquiry into oral and written language, remains inscribed in his own speaking and writing.

The paradox of the love-death tradition is mirrored in Goethe’s conception of truth and in the Romantic irony with which he shows that any representation of reality that is free from irony only masks it further.

As epistemological technologies of virtual space, museums and collections keep the real at a manageable distance in the face of anxieties.

Abstract: Examining culture in interaction helps us understand religious groups, too. For example, observers puzzle over the question of how Christianity and Islam (and other religions) can be used by terrorists and pacifists, fanatics and contemplative scholars, and casual observers alike. Previous explanations hinge on differences in interpretations of sacred texts—that is, different doctrinal standpoints, different beliefs about divine and earthly reality. Clearly, that is correct; certain branches of a religion highlight different chapters and verses of their sacred texts, and that explains many differences between members of the same religion. But we add another dimension to the question: an inspection of “culture in interaction” would ask if some of the differences between adherents of the same beliefs stem from different group styles.

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: In my role as historian of Americanist anthropology, I have long mused over the disproportionate influence of a small number of linguistic anthropologists over the discipline as a whole. Duranti cites two recent American Anthropological Association presidents who are linguistic anthropologists: I note that Jane Hill crosses into cultural as well as biological anthropology and Don Brenneis is difficult to identify solely as linguistic or cultural anthropologist. My own explanation tends toward the rhetoric of continuity within the three variants of linguistic anthropology. Because we are not contentious among ourselves, moving comfortably across both the subdisciplines of anthropology and the disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, linguistic anthropologists are often identified as effective mediators and synthesizers. The seminal role of Edward Sapir in the Rockefellersponsored interdisciplinary social science of the interwar years provides an early exemplar; Sapir persuaded his colleagues that Chicago sociology and psychology/psychoanalysis were not in conflict but explored different sides of a single coin (his metaphor). He had moved beyond descriptive and historical linguistics as handmaidens to ethnology into the psychological reality of the phoneme and the theory of culture.<br>

Abstract: If we follow Goffman, gestural movements are signifying movements; they have a conventional meaning. A smile does not have the same meaning in Japan as it does in America. But, more than that, gestures reveal a reality that becomes visible only through their mediation, which is that of a person. Bodies, in other words, become surfaces on which the definitions of the self and the other are inscribed. This piling up of mutual self‐definitions (and denunciation or ratification of these definitions in the course of the interaction) takes place between bodies. My first observation, then, is that this human body, through the mediation of the other body (the computer) talks only about itself and tells me nothing about myself. That is why I don’t know what to do. I’m interacting not with
         abody but with anextended body.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Several of the essays arein the theological senseapologetic. The first is a selfsituating, at times trenchant criticism of cognitive anthropology. The second is a historical account of psychoanalytic anthropology that is so parochial, so superficial that it hardly merits reading. Juillerat considers neither the critiques of psychoanalytic anthropology nor the research of ethnopsychoanalysts such as Paul Parin in Zurich, Waud Kracke in the United States, or the anthropologically oriented psychoanalysts in India, Japan, and South America. It would be a pity, however, if readers dismissed the book at this point, for the remaining essays are theoretically interesting, ethnographically rich, and at times conceptually disquieting. They include such topics as the nature of the symbol; the relationship between Freuds originary fantasies and LviStrausss basic kinship units (
      atomes de parent); the interaction between individual and collective representations; the conjunction of endopsychic projections of cosmologies and social reality; splitting and metamorphosis in the Yafar conception of death; parallels between the evolutionism in Yafar mythology and in BachofensMutterrecht; the stress on the paternal principle in Freud and the maternal in Jung; a rethinking of Maussian exchange theory that recognizes gifts that impose no obligation; an interpretation of a recent cargo cult that relates the land of plenty to the terror and longing for intrauterine return that is expressed in Yafar myth; and a reinterpretation of Naven as a psychodrama in which the uterine nephewthe eternal herois caught between agnatic law and incestuous ties with the mother. The last chapter consists of theoretical excerpts from JuilleratsLavnement du pre(1995), which, though meant to enrich the reading of Yafar ritual and myth, are difficult to evaluate out of context.<br>

Abstract: One of the most contentious issues that Neal had to deal with in volume 3 concerned the role of the Puritans in the trial and execution of Charles I. He insists that neither Puritanism itself nor the tenets of any group among the Puritans were responsible for the death of Charles I. The seizure of the king by the army and the subsequent purging of parliament, Neal says, “blew up the whole constitution, and buried king, parliament, and presbytery in its ruins.” Episcopal divines, “in order to throw off the king’s misfortunes from themselves, who by their obstinate behaviour had in reality reduced him to the last extremity,” diverted all blame onto the Puritan clergy—as their successors have continued to do to this day, he adds.
      35Neal has no difficulty in presenting detailed evidence of public statements, petitions, and letters from Puritan ministers in London and throughout the country protesting against the trial of the king and subsequently against his sentence and his execution. Neal says that he knows of only two ministers—Hugh Peters and John Goodwin—who did support the trial and execution of the king. “King Charles therefore died by the Hands of Violence, or by the military Sword, assumed and managed in an arbitrary manner by a few desperate Officers of the Army and their Dependants, of sundry Denominations as to Religion, without any regard to the ancient Constitution of their Country, or the fundamental Laws of Society.”36Neal is adamant that “the king’s death was not owing to the distinguishing tenets of any sect or party of Christians,”37and he provides further corroboration from contemporaries to reinforce this challenge to the received wisdom of churchmen past and present. The strongest evidence is the act of attainder of the king’s judges drawn up at the time of the restoration of Charles II.38This judgment makes clear that no specific religious party can be held responsible for the execution of Charles I. Nor does it ascribe responsibility to the~<br>

         124Because Braudel, always the schoolteacher, so emphasized his brief against biographical history, critics have often claimed that the delineation of limits and constraints inThe Mediterraneandevalues politics and events and leaves the book devoid of individual freedom.125Such misrepresentations distort the history that Braudel really presented: “The dangers of a social history are clear to us all, and in particular the danger of forgetting, in contemplation of the deep currents in the lives of men, each separate man grappling with his own life and his own destiny; the danger of forgetting, perhaps even of denying, the inimitable essence of each individual.”126For Braudel, the lessons of World War II demanded remembering both the forces acting upon each individual and individual acts freely chosen.127Braudel’sMéditerranéewas a call to arms: “The catastrophes and revolutions, dramas and surprises” of his time revealed “the social reality, the fundamental reality of man … in an entirely new light,” which in turn required a new history, a problem‐oriented and global, total history.128It was a new history slow to be understood, little to be appreciated, and rarely to be practiced in the Anglo‐American world remembering a different past and fighting different battles in the 1950s and 1960s. On the question of individual freedom, however, Braudel’s history of the sixteenth‐century Mediterranean is very similar to the work of its most brilliant contemporary political analyst, Machiavelli. We might recall the wily Florentine exile’s astute judgment when we reread the last words of Braudel’s penultimate paragraph in the second edition: “I would conclude with the paradox that the true man of action is he who can measure most nearly the constraints upon him, who chooses to~<br>

Abstract: MacIntyre shows how narratives constitute social life: “I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’ We enter human society, that is, with one or more imputed characters—roles into which we have been drafted” [
         13, p. 216]. While there continues to be argument over the claim that stories are lived before they are recounted and that life is stories being lived out, the work of Carr shows that this is so, for the overall temporal structure of action is narrative in character; life is an inchoate narrative [24]. Human reality is not just a sequence because it can be demonstrated that narrative coherence inheres in “even the most elementary experience or action” [24, p. 88]. Narrative coherence is “an essential structural feature of the very fact ofhavingan experience orperformingan action” [24, p. 88]. Hence, order is present in events even before a narrative is imposed on them, and “the real difference between ‘art’ and ‘life’ is not organization versus chaos, but rather the absence in life of that point of view which transforms events into a story bytellingthem” [24, p. 59]. This emphasis on activity is also found in MacIntyre: “Narrative is not the work of poets, dramatists and novelists reflecting upon events which had no narrative order before one was imposed by the singer or the writer; narrative form is neither disguise nor decoration” [13, p. 211]. For MacIntyre, human actions are themselves enacted narratives; for Carr, it is in living out a life that we achieve a “grasp” at the level of attempting to make meaning or sense of relationships [24]. According to Gare, following this line of thought shows us the following:
               
         Actions are lived stories. The more complex the action, the longer its duration and the more people involved, the more obviously this is the case. Actions such as building a community or developing our understanding of the~<br>

Abstract: I say “reconfigured strategically” to avoid the impression that my attempt to reconfigure the dialectic of comparative theology and theology of religions as a politically liberating praxis excludes the more elite discourses of the religious traditions involved (such as those of India’s Brahmins and China’s Confucian elites), which are in many cases both hegemonic (within a particular cultural framework) and marginalized (within a larger or global context). The solidary praxis of restoring and enabling subaltern religious representations is aimed at establishing participatory parity as a political reality in which both subaltern and elite representations could take part as decentered centers that are all other to one another and no longer as subaltern or elite in terms of sociopolitical and cultural hegemony. To bring into being such a politically level playing field, in which the more elite discourses find themselves also liberated and with a new voice, I think it is strategically necessary to emphasize first an act of solidarity with the oppressed. I thank the anonymous reviewer of my essay for raising the question of my thesis’s possible exclusion of elite religious discourses.<br>

Abstract: I trust that what I have written here clarifies, in the course of the discussion, the relevance and significance of the seven characteristics of Don Browning’s style of theologizing. Following in his footsteps I hope to have made a contribution to the public theology he espouses—the first characteristic I mentioned at the beginning of this article. I trust that I have likewise shown my interest—the second characteristic—in the institutions determining people’s concrete daily lives, as well as influencing and coloring their norms, values, and religiosity. I have referred specifically to the institution of law, especially human rights law. The third characteristic is also clear: as Browning’s study of marriage and the family is conducted in a global, more especially an interreligious perspective, I have paid due attention to interreligious interaction and dialogue, which dominate not only politics and the mass media but also the conversations in our living rooms. Both of us are convinced that any public theology must be characterized by an empirical approach—the fourth characteristic. In his family project, Browning not only collaborates with social scientists but also incorporates their empirical research into the goal and content of his project. In this article, I, too, have used insights from political and social sciences, as well as empirical‐theological research, in order to relate the assumptions and principles of interreligious interaction and dialogue directly to empirical reality.<br>

Abstract: Trying to make sense of the square between the National Gallery/former palace and the mausoleum as a semiotic space, the cultural historian Dafina Dicheva laments the victory of destruction. She notes that, while the two buildings were indeed entangled in an epic metaphoric struggle, their physical presence side by side secured not only a synchronic but also a diachronic representation of the city's historical meanings, like a palimpsest. Transition periods always vacillate between rewriting and reassessment, but one would hope that any act would bring in some new meaning. The demolition of the mausoleum, according to Dicheva, left only a “desemioticized center and the debilitating power of the symbol of destruction, threatening in its insistence that anything can disappear.” In this context, she interprets the subsequent
         Bierfestin the square as a symbolic demolition in the wake of the physical one. It does not invert reality into the carnivalesque and thus integrate culture; instead, it disintegrates culture by transforming reality into carnival, where theBierfestis experienced as total reality. “Destruction does not allow the reconstruction of the social and cultural order. … On the contrary, it is a mirror inversion, which blocks the social and individual experience at the level of anticulture.”91<br>

Abstract: From this angle, the child may be viewed as contemporary morality’s greatest test. The work of the human sciences shows the diversity of ways in which children’s lives are disenfranchised but also deeply resilient. It can map the complex contours of problems like children’s persistent poverty or relations to mass media. But theological ethics must step in to help imagine how to make children a creative new response. To do to a child as you would have done to yourself is to respond to the profoundest possible depths of human otherness and marginality with a radically self‐transforming love and hope. It is to open oneself and one’s social world to reversing ingrained exclusions and oversimplifications through ever more other‐inclusive moral horizons. Responsibility for children in both families and society reveals the extent to which moral life is not just a fixed reality but also a transcending journey of creative response and renewal.<br>

Abstract: A genuine atmosphere of deliberation requires three principles: “The basic premise of reciprocity is that citizens owe one another justifications for the institutions, laws, and public policies that collectively bind them. … Together with reciprocity, two other principles specify the conditions of democratic deliberation. The principle of publicity requires that reason‐giving be public in order that it may be mutually justifiable. The principle of accountability specifies that officials who make decisions on behalf of other people, whether or not they are electoral constituents, should be accountable to those people” [
      34, pp. 133, 135]. Within the framework of rights (encompassing justice as fairness) and the process of deliberation according to a discourse ethical approach, librarianship can be better able to address the difficult issues it faces. The reality of pluralism necessitates both rights and deliberation. Deliberation, as a process, cannot help but be dialectical. As has been shown here, there are differing conceptions of right and good, of intellectual freedom and censorship, even of ethical theories. To at least some extent, the discussion and controversy surrounding these issues are antinomies, contradictions between statements that each has reasonable grounds. Dialectics, as a means of resolving contradictions and reconciling division, has its foundations in Hegel. Steven Smith ably summarizes the key elements of a dialectical approach:
               It is by such an approach that we, as a profession, can arrive at a fully formed practical and normative ethics. It would be fruitless to ignore the divisions and disagreements; they must be addressed dialogically. Further, the dialogue is inescapably phenomenological (as described above) in that legitimacy, which includes beliefs and voice, must be assumed by all, with regard to all. The foregoing is an attempt to further the dialogue.Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. ~<br>

Abstract: Popkin defines such autobiographies as published personal narratives in which professional historians discuss first and foremost their lives. His corpus includes close to four hundred book‐length and shorter texts by Western historians—essentially Americans and Europeans. Following Paul Ricoeur, Popkin emphasizes the literary autonomy of autobiography. While it shares traits with history and fiction, this “hybrid genre” alone brings together “an unstable mixture of fabulation and actual experience,” an independence from documentation, an investigation into “the inner experience of time,” a lack of closure, and an ability to supplement reality through rhetorical transformation (45, 47).<br>

Abstract: Ever since 9/11 there has been a swelling chorus of opinion aimed at demonstrating how the destruction of the World Trade towers has constituted an event of world historical magnitude announcing the installation of a new time marked by a boundless present. As if transported by a time machine, Americans were instantly relocated within a new temporal architecture that declared the removal of an antecedent past from the present, history from its future. The nation was forcibly induced to embark upon an unprecedented, endless war against terror, and its citizens were persuaded to accept the imperative of living a new reality in a perennial present. Remarkably, this urgent appeal to a new time echoed Japanese pronouncements at the outset of World War II announcing the inauguration of total war and calling for the establishment of emergency measures as a condition of mobilizing the population to wage an endless war against the West in order to realize the promise of its world historical mission in the present. Not surprisingly, Richard Perle, shortly before the beginning of the current military invasion of Iraq, demanded the promulgation of a total war in the war against terrorism, qualifying it further as an infinite war. Underlying the claims of a new temporal tectonics, shifting time plates to set the present adrift, was the presumption that a consequential eventfulness had occurred, which exceeded the framework of received forms of marking time. With this eventful divide, the present was both severed from its historical past and indefinitely deprived of a future from which it once derived expectation. But the wish to live in an endless present committed solely to waging war with an unseen and unknown enemy—a wish that would now define the coordinates of daily life (and rein in its dangerous political excess)—was not only overstated by those who seized upon the immediate political opportunities supplied by the attack on the twin towers but actually misrecognized the hi~<br>

Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against the first characterization of Advaita teaching, the recognition of the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the
         anayatvamsutra (II.1.14)—that is, as internally constituted by the realist cosmological discourse that it subverts—suggests that the interpretation of theBhāṣya’steaching in terms of the illusionist doctrine ofmāyāvādais reductionistic. Moreover, well‐intentioned attempts to dissociate Śaṅkara frommāyāvādathat presume a monological conception of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse, attempts such as that of Srinivasa Rao mentioned above, end up effectively conceding the claim they set out to deny; their affirmation of the reality of the world typically appeals to a denial of substantial change, a claim that implicitly relegates changing, finite existences to the realm of the unreal.114As for the static and abstract conception of brahman, this notion can be seen as the result of the later tradition’s attempt to impose a rigid, categorical distinction between the concepts ofīśvaraand the highest (paraṃ) brahman. This effort to systematize Śaṅkara’s somewhat inconsistent, fluid, and intuitive use of the termīśvarawith respect to the various expressions for brahman effectively pulls apart the dialectical interplay between the personalistic and impersonalistic aspects of brahman in theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣya. What Hacker characterizes as an “illogical” combination of intuitive theism and intellectual monism can perhaps be better understood as an instance of what Michael Sells, in a discussion of apophatic language in the West, calls “a discourse of double propositions.”115A reading of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyathat appreciates the creative interplay among this text’s multiple voices preserves the vitality and intensity of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse on brahman, a liveliness of expression that we may assume more accurately reflects Śaṅkara’s religious vision.<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: Characteristic of this new attitude toward the past are the closing words of Sanders’s recently published volume,
         Adaptation and Appropriation(2006), in the Routledge Critical Idiom series. Opening her final paragraph with the claim that “We need then to restore to the subgenres or practices of adaptation and appropriation a genuinely celebratory comprehension of their capacity for creativity, and for comment and critique,” she concludes: “Adaptation and appropriation … are all about multiple interactions and a matrix of possibilities. They are, endlessly and wonderfully, about seeing things come back to us in as many forms as possible” (Sanders2006, 160). This is the rhetoric of hedonistic liberalism, celebrating multiplicity and pluralism for its own sake, for the choices it allows; it is Fredric Jameson’s postmodernity whose “relationship to the past is that of a consumer adding another rare object to the collection, or another flavour to the international banquet” (1998, 129). Typically, there is no word about the future re‐vision might help to envision, no sense of “memory as a means to liberation” (Greene1991b, 291), of the interlocking of memory and the feminist project, of looking back in order to move forward. On the left, concerns about the disappearance of the future and capitalism’s increasing monopoly on it are growing, as are laments about the loss of a sense of historical time as a teleology moving away from a past from which we could learn and into a future that would be different (see Gumbrecht2004, 120; see also Jameson2005). There are those who are bitter about it, complaining, as does Terry Eagleton inAfter Theory(2003), that “Over the dreary decades of post‐1970s conservatism, the historical sense had grown increasingly blunted, as it suited those in power that we should be able to imagine no alternative to the present” (Eagleton2003, 6–7).

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: This unique notion of truth for librarianship that we are proposing is derived from what has been called historicism. Historicism is not really a theory of truth as much as it is a theory of knowledge in which the question of objective truth is eliminated. This elimination of objective truth implicit in historicism has been attacked from many quarters. The origin of this theory is J. G. Herder’s
         Reflections on the Philosophy of the History of Man[71]. With regard to the question of truth, historicism interprets both human consciousness and the propositions expressing the nature of humans themselves and all of reality as historically conditioned, even current knowledge [71, pp. 96–104]. Herder looked at the supposed teleological progression of reason and found it often wanting. Nevertheless, he believed that reason and goodness would eventually triumph over irrationalism and human folly [71, pp. 115–18]. Consider the following example that illustrates the difference between historicism and the three theories of truth discussed above. For the historicist, the proposition that the world is the center of the universe was true for the medieval mind. For the correspondence theorist, that proposition is simply false, although the additional fact that the medieval mind accepted this proposition to be true would be conceded. The coherence theorist would say that, although the medieval mind accepted the Aristotelian‐Ptolemaic view of the universe, which in itself is a coherent system of propositions, this coherent system would eventually be supplanted by Copernicus’s view. This revolutionary change in knowledge is often expressed as a paradigm by Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science. The historicist would point out that such paradigms of knowledge usually have a localized point of origin and gradually expand to the other areas of scholarship, finally entering the public consciousness, where they are accepted or rejected [67, pp. 160–73]. The historicist ackn~<br>

The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Airy theoretical statements like these begin to sound downright saccharine when the subject turns to religion. Consider the following statement: “Presence [oddly, this term is sometimes capitalized by Reynolds, sometimes not] is an inescapable existential presupposition, a kind of eschatological affirmation built into the praxis of availability. … When we encounter the presence of the other, we cannot help but say ‘it is good’” (147). One wants to know how these sentences would be received by a Palestinian attempting to negotiate an Israeli checkpoint or by a student at one of the stricter jihadist‐leaning madrassas in Pakistan. For approximately two pages (150–52), Reynolds dwells on the darker realities of pluralism and difference: violence, mistrust, fear, imperialism, and domination. Undeterred, however, he moves swiftly to “the recovery of trust,” arguing that despite all appearances to the contrary, “religious faith [is] a ‘saving’ performance” that “places us … in a trustworthy and gratuitous ultimate environment, one that resists falsification by the conditions of finitude” (158). One senses that reality is not receiving due attention.<br>

Abstract: In his notion of involuntary memory, Marcel corrects the Aristotelian principle that an object of the imagination that is imprinted in memory cannot coincide with the present experience of the object itself, because “there is no such thing as memory of the present.” Although he espouses the Aristotelian principle that “one can only imagine what is absent,” Marcel sees this principle as invalidated whenever the essential character of a presently experienced sensation coincides with that of a sensation imprinted in memory. In such an instance, one can enjoy the impression of the present sensation to the fullest; thanks to the intensifying “application” of one’s imagination of it, one enjoys, in other words, the impression that a sensation or event from the past is being concretely resuscitated in the here and now. This imaginative appreciation of the present throws one into the bliss of a dimension “emancipated from the order of time” (affranchie de l’ordre du temps) and makes one oblivious of or indifferent to the squalor of one’s “directly felt reality.” Aristotle, “On Memory,” in

Abstract: Earlier I stated that just‐war morality involves a spiritual exercise—an ascesis—demanding political elites and ordinary citizens to discipline their attitudes, practices, and representations of the Other.
         75I also said that such an idea suggests a controversial point that harks back to an idea from Augustine, namely, that virtue is grounded in the practice of confession. We are now in a position to see how that is so. Confession for Augustine was not solely or chiefly a matter of privately disclosing personal temptation and wrongdoing, as is often thought. Such personal reports are part of a more general practice of rendering oneself accountable to standards that one does not wishfully create (or project), objective norms by which to measure one’s subjective leanings and desires. Confession, in short, is a matter of making oneself accountable to standards and purposes beyond one’s immediate interests. For Augustine and for those who follow in his path, self‐knowledge quickly slides into excessive self‐love and self‐deception without objective reference points by which to measure oneself. Self‐knowledge, including one’s personal and social memories, must be tested by the principle of reality. Virtue for Augustine thus relies on the willingness to submit oneself to norms by which to evaluate one’s loyalties and commitments. In our self‐reflexive acts, we must ask ourselves whether our self‐interpretation is grounded in reality or fabricated with an eye toward self‐justification.<br>

Abstract: The remembrance of death and the love of life, which I have explored today, are in fact etched into the structures of our everyday, lived reality. Forty years ago this week, riots broke out at Columbia University and other institutions of higher learning and then, in May, throughout the United States and Europe over the war in Vietnam. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. We are still at war but now on a global scale. And the killing of the just and innocent continues. Years ago some farsighted people grasped the massive danger we posed to our planet’s environment and forms of life, and we this week celebrate Earth Week in order to counter that danger. The past months have been scarred by an onslaught of murders in our city, especially against children. The remembrance of death surrounds us. Yet this week is also one of freedom and life. Jews around the world during Passover look back and reenact those events that led to their liberation from bondage. Christians look forward to Pentecost and the rush of new life in the spirit. Other religions also celebrate life in its many forms. People of good will around the world struggle against the onslaught of poverty, oppression, and dehumanization in the name of human dignity and also the fragile goodness of finite life.<br>

Abstract: Such diversity inevitably generates interpretive contradictions and makes the author's stated goals—to compare the films' thematic content and form with those of the colonial cinema that preceded it and to use postcolonial film as a barometer for assessing how French collective memory has come to terms with its imperialist history—difficult to achieve. While Eades's painstaking analysis of the continuities and ruptures between colonial and postcolonial cinema is impressive, her contention that the latter “forced recognition of a reality grudgingly accepted by political authorities and the general population” (22) until the mid‐1990s and “called into question imperial ideology in all its dimensions” (203) is less convincing. While the majority of these films do at some level acknowledge the failures and abuses of French imperialism, most also avoid explicit reference to controversial issues and events (most notably, the French army's practice of torture in Algeria) and ignore the subjective experience of colonized peoples, highlighting instead the plight of colonizers caught in morally untenable situations because of the corrupt system that surrounds them. The result, as Eades recognizes, is that the colonized tend to remain little more than stereotypes while audiences are encouraged to identify with the European perspective. In so doing, postcolonial cinema implicitly perpetuates the epistemological prejudices of overtly imperialist films from the 1920s and 1930s.<br>

Abstract: Perhaps it took later media—and particularly the new media of video games, the interactive internet, and virtual reality—to let us recognize that cinema has never really been about immediacy. Its spontaneity and contingency—its neorealism—has always been the lure by which it offers an experience that, properly speaking, is not immediate at all, but reflective, resonant, and voluminous. Films provide experiences in such number and variety and to such powerful effect that they deserve and have received sustained study. They discipline us so that we can learn from them. This is a relationship we should not grow out of.<br>

Article Title: Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer: Responsibility, Parergon, and Catachresis<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: The rationale for prayer as a responsive and responsible act in the breach of violated fidelity to God can be found in simple form as early as 1810. In a notebook entry, Coleridge wondered how “imperfect and enslaved man” could ever fulfill the resolutions and dictates of conscience. He notes that the “Mere knowledge of the right, we find by experience, does not suffice to ensure the performance of the Right—for mankind in general. How indeed should it, if mankind … are sick & weak in their moral Being.” The answer is to find “the medium between mere conviction & resolve, & suitable
         action. … Such a medium is absolutely necessary, since there is no saltus in nature—This medium is found in Prayer, & religious Intercommunion between Man & his Maker” (N4017). If action always fails to follow moral resolve, prayer lies somehow between act and resolution. A medial function also features in Coleridge’s mature reflections on the topic, as with a note of July 1827 that seeks “some state of Being, in which the productive energy is the produce, where the agent is in the same moment and the self‐same Act the patient & wrestling conquers for himself what is yet bestowed on him of free grace. Now this is the Idea of Prayer; and in Prayer alone can the reality of the Idea be found” (N5554, fol. 12v). The terms are more complex than in 1810. Here, the idea of responsibility is intertwined with response: what is at stake is an individual will countersigning the divine will while remaining individual. Responsibility to God’s will means, in effect, fulfilling God’s claim on us, but freely, so that “the Act and Will of the Divine Spirit … may nevertheless be rightly named the Act and Will of the Human Recipient” (N5554, fol. 10v). Nevertheless, despite the different terms, the same mediating function is apparent: prayer joins the human will with the divine command.<br>

Abstract: The central scene in Dupré's tableau depicts the emergence of the human mind as the sole “source of meaning and value.” As with Blumenberg, Gauchet, and Taylor, the autonomy of the self is here presented as a response to theological problems originating in the medieval period. Once God had been enshrined as absolute in the “classical-Christian synthesis” of nominalist theology, transcendence posed as much of a threat as an assurance. The omnipotence of divine will, Dupré observes, “abrogated the link of intelligibility that connected the source of reality with its created effect,” so that “God no longer provided rational justification of the world.” In the aftermath of this rupture, “meaning” would now have to be “imposed by the human mind,” a task that in turn required Descartes, Locke, Kant, and their contemporaries to develop “a new sense of selfhood” (Dupré, xi-6, 19–46, quotes on xi, 2–3, 45).<br>

Abstract: Abdullah Azzam, a mentor to bin Laden, wrote in his “Martyrs: The Building Blocks of Nations” (
               http://www.religioscope.com/info/doc/jihad/azzam_martyrs.htm): “History does not write its lines except with blood. Glory does not build its loft[y] edifice except with skulls. Honor and respect cannot be established except on a foundation of cripples and corpses. Empires, distinguished peoples, states and societies cannot be established with examples. Indeed those who think that they can change reality or change societies without blood, sacrifices and invalids, without pure, innocent souls, do not understand the essence of this Deen [Islam] and they do not know the method of the best of Messengers [Muhammad].” David Cook (“Suicide Attacks”) points out how forced it is to construe this sentiment as truly Islamic. Nonetheless, he also points out that in the face of adversity Muslims frequently characterize their community as one that is indifferent to death, in opposition to polytheists who love life.<br>

Abstract: Because the promise extends and depends upon trust, it opens a space fertile for free exchange and responsibility purged of agonism. This free and noncompetitive reciprocity depends upon the doubling of the promise into its initial token and final gift. The first token might be symbolically related to the final gift, as the deed and keys are to the house, but they are simply not the final gift. This difference is decisive for addressing the character of competition and the threat of violent giving, the offer one cannot refuse, since the token is nothing, a trace, perhaps, a little something that requires trust in order for it to have any significance. Because the promise is doubled into a token, it does not have reality without trust. The promisor may indeed go on to deliver the final gift without anyone according him or her truth, but there is no debt created here since the significance of this token depends upon the trust of the one receiving it. It has no force without it and so does not replicate the way the appearance of one bearing gifts carries with it the threat of acceptance or rejection.<br>

Abstract: This is already clear in “Literature and the Right to Death,” the essay to which Lévinas was responding in “Reality and Its Shadow.” There Blanchot writes, “where is literature's power? It plays at working in the world, and the world regards its work as a worthless or dangerous game.”
         34Blanchot's rhetoric here is once again remarkably similar to Lévinas's in “Reality and Its Shadow” and is seemingly as negative. Yet what condemns literature for Lévinas redeems it for Blanchot. Ultimately it is the way in which literature deforms action into inaction that gives it its importance. Its function first appears as a resistance to the philosophical concept.<br>

Abstract: Besides the Aristotelian tradition, Franciscan theology offered Dante, as a lay Franciscan himself, another theory of creatures that focuses on the idea of immanence in nature.
         41Following Francis, the Franciscans bring “creation” to the foreground as the incarnate reality of God's continuing presence in the world. For the Franciscan theologian Bonaventure, nature is everything that exists that is not God but is made by God.42Although adhering to the Aristotelian tradition that man is the rational creature, Bonaventure also discusses how Francis greeted a large flock of birds “as if they were endowed with reason” (eas velut rationis participles salutavit).43Bonaventure states the fundamental principle of Franciscan spirituality—that the natural phenomena of the world reveal their creator, even, one could say, make their creator immanently present: “Creatures are shadows, echoes and pictures of that first, most powerful, most wise and most perfect Principle, of that eternal Source, Light, Fulness, of that efficient, exemplary and ordering Art. They are vestiges, representations, spectacles, proposed to us and signs divinely given so that we can see God.”44<br>

Abstract: Yet Larmore also suspects the ideal of personal autonomy underlying the constricted view of the mind as a “mirror of the world”; he thinks it encourages the idea that we have to endorse or decide to adopt any “element of good or bad” or criterion found in the world before it can move us (104). But, while Larmore offers ample reasons to reject this view of the mind as essentially disengaged before its choices or endorsements, neither this disengaged view nor the suspect “specular model” of the mind in general follows from the more modest thesis that decision has a unique role to play in our agency—for decisions may always respond to considerations that are either apprehended as normative or potentially action guiding before we are intentionally committed to them, or to considerations that are dependent on past decisions (to which this same condition applies together with a ban on infinite regresses). Similarly, we should not construe “autonomous” decision or action as completely independent of all prior reasons or even of the community of language speakers in relation to which our thoughts have meaning (105). This is a straw man version of autonomy that goes beyond even Stoic autarky to total solipsism—as if Sartrean arbitrary choice were the only way to explain the concept of self-determination or deep responsibility for one’s character. Nor need Kant’s conception of autonomy imply that the world or order of reality itself cannot contain any normative facts (107), although it has sometimes been misread that way. Instead it may simply mean that distinctively moral norms are not essentially coercive—that right is not mere might—because they fit our fundamental nature as beings capable of making decisions in response to the other nonmoral normative aspects of reality that Larmore calls a “third ontological order” in addition to physical and psychological facts (126). Kant does not hold that our rational assent to moral norms is optional; it is implicit in what we are. ~<br>

Abstract: This tensional approach enables new possibilities for the field. As David Jasper recognizes, literature is no longer (to quote John Wesley) the “handmaid of piety” (5). Accordingly, the field is not limited to art and literature that are explicitly theological or religious, nor is it limited to literature and theology within the Christian traditions. Literature can now both instruct and deconstruct theology. For Jasper, theology is no longer tenable without literature. Invoking Emmanuel Lévinas as well as Ricoeur, Hass helps us to understand why: theology needs the apophatic power of metaphor to redescribe reality and to confront the other that cannot be reduced to any single discipline. Alana Vincent reminds us that this is not easy, nor is this work ever done, but this is what makes the work so valuable. Interdisciplinary inquiry confronts us with insurmountable uncertainties and ambiguities, but these challenges are constructive opportunities to reflect upon the limits of our knowledge, our boundaries, and our disciplines.<br>

Abstract: A further source of ambiguity is the heterogeneous usage of
            ṭumʾahin the Bible, a diversity that is not easily organized into a unitary logical scheme. Blurring the domains of hygiene and morality, and encompassing disparate situations such as genital emissions (normal and abnormal), corpses, bloodshed, sexual misconduct and idolatry, this term seems to resist systematic analysis. In reality, however, the main obstacle that stands in the way of making sense of this category is a lexicographic predisposition towards abstract, disembodied logic, particularly the assumption that linguistic categories are defined by necessary and sufficient membership criteria.<br>

Can it also be applied to Geertz’s approach to religion, ideology, and other “systems”? Were we to consider the spiritual (whatever that may mean) as an essential component of religiosity, the spiritual would then be analogous to the moral.<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Badiou’s attempt to “extract a formal, wholly secularized conception of grace”
         
               from the Pauline texts and to exploit their political potential while disregarding Paul’s theological commitments stems, basically, from his rejection of transcendence as such. Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation aimed to redefine God’s transcendence understood in a sense of other-worldliness so that it could be found in immanence (“God is beyond even in the middle of our lives”187
            
               ), that is to say, in the “neighbor who is within reach in any given situation.”188
            
               The God of Bonhoeffer is, in a sense, an absent God, a God who in the midst of the world remains invisible and silent until Christians make God present and visible by their participation in Jesus’s being for others. While Bonhoeffer radically reinterprets the traditional Christian notion of transcendence, Badiou simply does away with it. In this regard, he represents “a shared new determination to grapple with the legacy of the death of God in a deeper way than ever before, re-making philosophy from the ground up as a thinking ‘without God.’”189
            
               When Badiou speaks of the “death of God,” what he means by “God” is not only the metaphysical God with whose death Nietzsche and Heidegger were concerned (the end of onto-theology) and whose death enables the return of a “more divine” God. In light of his ontology, all three meanings of the word “God” that he distinguishes, that is, the living God of religion, the conceptual God of metaphysics, and the God of the poets, become superfluous.190
            
               As a consequence, even a theological understanding of religion—as, for instance, “a personal communion between God and human beings”191
            
               —that could be accepted by Bonhoeffer cannot stand in the face of Badiou’s radical dismissal of transcendence. However, when we look at the reality~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673118<br>
Date: 09 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Bosola’s figure is only one of the play’s many attempts to make sense out of seemingly senseless cruelty. The same world of suffering that leads to his image of the stars’ tennis match inspires a very different response from Antonio. In conversation with the Duchess, Antonio delivers one of the most notable of the play’s many “wise” statements: “Man (like to
      Cassia) is prov’d best, being bruiz’d” (3.5.71). In a precursor to Bradley’s meditations on the fragrance of a crushed flower, Antonio also responds to tragic events with an argument that our best selves are revealed through suffering, making pain a valuable experience and tragedy a process of identity formation. Antonio’s perspective, like Bradley’s, grows out of confrontation with a tragic world that appears destined to crush its inhabitants and through associations that find value in that process. But just as the play casts doubt on the ability of the senses to perceive reality, it also questions the capacity of metaphor to make sense of suffering. Webster’s strongest character, the Duchess, rejects Antonio’s philosophy—although even she cannot escape the metaphorical thinking ingrained in the world of the play. In response to Antonio, she produces two images of her own:
            Though she initially rejects Antonio’s philosophy outright, the Duchess reveals her own uncertainty about the nature and meaning of her suffering by introducing a second figurative interpretation. Her images inject the play with what could be seen as an optimistic view of divine involvement in human life, and she asserts her own ability to make “sense” of her pain through concepts developed out of her personal experience, not generalized

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: The value of Popkin's approach becomes clear in his chapter on two historians whose autobiographies have been included in the literary canon for many years: Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams. By reading them as historians, Popkin offers new insights to an already great body of literature on these authors, for instance by showing that both Gibbon and Adams believed that their personal experiences helped them in understanding the past. Not all 327 autobiographers listed in the bibliography are discussed in depth, and in chapters on vocation and career their works serve to sketch an impression of the historical profession in the twentieth century. Bookish children from middle‐class backgrounds, as most historians have been, often picked up their vocation from parents or teachers. They were also often inspired by children's books like those by Jules Verne and Karl May, which is interesting, because despite these literary models they chose to write nonfiction. For Popkin this is a telling detail, as he concludes that historians are obviously motivated by a wish to tell stories. With few exceptions historians are reluctant to write about their careers. Most are silent about their academic successes, failures, and frustrations, and few pages are spent on the daily life of teaching courses and doing administrative work. On the contrary, most authors want to show that they had another life besides their profession. Therefore they often describe their own lives against the background of great events. Since Jean‐Jacques Rousseau's
      Confessions, autobiography has been seen as a genre that should focus on the innermost experience and not world events, but many historians simply could not cast off their professional background. Often only those historians who were involved in politics became aware of how little an individual could accomplish, or lost faith in the ideas they once had believed. Holocaust memoirs are discussed in a separate chapter, in which Popkin concludes that t~<br>

Abstract: Murray Jardine continues this theme of “foundations without foundationalism” in his essay “Sight, Sound, and Participatory Symbolization,” which compares the communications of print and speech in the context of Voegelin's and Poteat's philosophies. According to Jardine, literate cultures tend to promote thinking of symbols as visual phenomena, which results in neglecting the initial experiential content behind them. Voegelin's conception of consciousness as participatory and his emphasis on experience asks us to return to an oral culture in which reality is conceived of in a personal context; what this context consists of, however, especially with respect to Christianity, is a source of disagreement for Voegelin and Poteat. For Jardine, Voegelin misconceptualized Christian revelation in terms of nature instead of human creativity, leading to a dogmatization of own symbolization of the Christian experience (83). This misconception of Christianity stems from Voegelin's belief that Christian revelation has been “a closed matter” since the time of Augustine.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Abstract: The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on “detainee abuse” at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) “constructionist analytics,” I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that “really occurred” throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems.<br>

Author(s): Young Aaron<br>
Abstract: Postmodern theory is often seen as a realm either of totally free play--where anything goes and there are no rules at all--or of despair where all visions of equality and democracy are equated with totalitarianism. Coherent ways of talking about "actors" or "responsibility" can appear to be entirely repudiated. Further perceived as elitist, obscure, convoluted, and entirely removed from any kind of practical reality, postmodernism is often viewed as having nothing relevant to say to teachers or those interested in concretely improving education. This paper attempts to show that these visions are not entirely fair to the ways many "postmodern" theorists strive to explore carefully the myriad tensions invariably involved in politics and pedagogy or to the (perhaps surprising) egalitarian commitments that generally undergird their projects. Taking advantage of the fluid and ultimately undefinable character of the idea of the "postmodern," this paper draws from an eclectic group of thinkers, teasing out a range of different perspectives that might inform, complicate, and contest efforts to "teach freedom."<br>

Issue: i259974<br>
Date: 3 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Wuthnow Robert<br>
Abstract: Bainbridge and Stark's essay on "The Consciousness Reformation" illustrates conceptual and theoretical ambiguities characteristic of research in the scientific study of religion more generally. This paper traces these ambiguities to the presence of two competing, but poorly differentiated, epistemological traditions. An examination of the assumptions implicit within each of these traditions provides a basis for clarifying the distinction between religious symbolism and religious belief, the concept of meaning, the difference between consistency as an attribute of belief and coherence as an attribute of reality, and the role of interpersonal bonds in maintaining the plausibility of religious symbolism. An emerging third perspective that appears to circumvent some of the limitations of the two major epistemological traditions is also discussed.<br>

Abstract: Aspects of the Pratyabhijñā philosophical theology for monistic Śaivism of the ninth- and tenth-century Kashmiri thinkers Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta are interpreted in relation to their relevance and pre-sumptiveness to contemporary Western thought. It is claimed that the Pratyabhijñā system elucidates important features of our past and present deliberations about the role of interpretation in experience and provides us with a sound way of arguing for the reality of God.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261417<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Patoeka Edward F.<br>
Abstract: This article examines the ties between the work of Václav Havel and his dissident mentor Jan Patočka. Havel's political theory consists largely of an evocative, literary reformulation of a number of themes developed by Patočka, the student of Husserl and Heidegger generally recognized as the most significant Czech philosopher of the century. Insofar as Patočka's work continues to be ignored in the West, the intuitively appealing essays of Havel will themselves fail to be fully understood. This study offers an analysis of Havel's debt to Patočka, as well as an explication of the latter's political thought. With Patočka's phenomenological interpretation of ancient and contemporary thought, of Socrates and Heidegger, a bridge is built between the classical and the postmodern that seeks to ground ethics and politics without recourse to the foundationalism of metaphysical accounts of reality.<br>

Author(s): Bachelard Clive R.<br>
Abstract: In a practice environment that unswervingly promotes the systematic tendencies of efficient architectural productivity, to the detriment of architectural creativity, it becomes increasingly important for studio pedagogy to recover and sustain an imaginative engagement with the richness and ambiguity of lived reality. Inhabiting the Chasm is a studio project that attempts to deny the urge to rationalize program and structure and any unchallenged participation in the prevailing apparatus of conventionalized graphic depiction. The project focuses on the simultaneously unfathomable yet familiar reality of two individuals in love. It encourages a perception of the architect as place maker, as interpreter of dynamic human events, and as creator of the settings for the unraveling of dramatic human action.<br>

Article Title: Against Wholeness: The Ego's Complicity in Religion<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Vergote Volney P.<br>
Abstract: Many students of religion suggest that wholeness or the attainment of an integrated self is an especially valuable goal whose attainment marks a moment of religious insight. Theoreticians like Jung, Allport, and Maslow strongly support this belief. Freud does not. To reconcile the two camps one must either drop Freud altogether or confine his critique of religion to an attack upon neurotic religion, or more exactly, religion based upon superego functioning. One could then claim that healthy religion is a function of the ego, e.g., the ego's tendency towards integrated functioning and the attainment of 'wholeness'. I argue that this ploy, which is itself a function of an egosyntonic desire for wholeness, is altogether wrong. It misrepresents Freud's ego psychology and it therefore misrepresents his critique of the ego's role in religion as well. First, his theoretical, as opposed to his literary, critique of religion is also a critique of certain characteristics of the ego. Second, these characteristics, especially the ego-syntonic drive towards feelings of wholeness, are functions of the ego's obedience to repetition compulsion. Third, the later texts on religion cannot be understood apart from their roots in Freud's earliest theory of ego functioning, especially the physicalist program he developed in his "Project" of 1895. The ego creates and takes part in religious dramas which present an illusory world of wholeness and completion of self. But as the seat of reality testing it must pierce the veils as quickly and as repeatedly as it weaves them.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Generic Analysis of a Classic of the Social Gospel: An Essay-Review of Walter Rauschenbusch<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have seldom avoided anecdotal data and included in their texts information about how they produce knowledge that they claim to be true. While considering fieldwork as the foundation of their discipline as well as their identity, they have removed this activity from analysis and overlooked its relationship with textualisation. This account of fieldwork in Quilombo Frechal (Maranhao, Brazil) purports to move from "participant observation to observation of participation" (Tedlock 1991), including in written texts the process of construction of anthropological knowledge. It attempts to represent the social reality of "Others" through an analysis of one's own experience in their world.<br>

Author(s): Yonnet Sergio Dalla<br>
Abstract: The legend is, as custum, the place were the principle of reality is suspended: "the place were day-dreaming is allowed". Actually, in the current practice, the use of this fabulous space/instrument crosses ambits officially destinated to the reverie. Fragments of legend impregnate the entire experience allowing us the most shameless alchemy. If we consider the "legendary" in its pragmatic implications and pass through the question: "what do we do, in the every day life, when we evoke in a more or less explicit way the semantic constellation linked with the notion of legend?", then the "legendary" is not so much the "projective place" where we live for a moment our phantasies, but rather an operation that allows to reconcile concrete interests and ideal values, playing on the demarcation line and mixing up cards skilfully.<br>

Abstract: Freud: "The analytic treatment now proceeds to follow [the libido]; it seeks to
track down the libido, to make it accessible to consciousness and, in the end, serviceable
for reality. Where the investigations of analysis come upon the libido withdrawn into
its hiding place, a struggle is bound to break out; all the foreces which have caused the li-
bido to regreess will rise up as 'resistances' against the work of analysis, in order to con-]
serve the new state of things" (1912:12)]

Abstract: Eliade proposed to 'undertake to analyze the religious creativity of modern societies' in his "History of Religious Ideas" but never did so. In this paper I have attempted to suggest the general direction that his analysis would have taken -- the identification of the real with the actual is a religious valorization of contemporary humanity. This is not a generic shift from religion to non-religion but a belief of a religious nature which constitutes a novel departure from the traditional operations of the religious mind. It is accompanied by a refusal to countenance our creative involvement in the construction of reality. This Eliade labels 'modern' and 'historical'.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20099867<br>
Date: 6 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Bird Robert<br>
Abstract: Aleksej Losev's definition of myth centres on the concept of detachment. In modern times detachment has most often figured in the context of philosophical aesthetics, where it is a cognitive category akin to Kant's "disinterestedness" or the Russian formalists' "estrangement." However Losev's usage also makes reference to the ontological sense of detachment as contemplative ascent (cf. Meister Eckhardt's "Abgeschiedenheit"). Thus, Losev's concept of myth combines both senses of detachment, binding perceptual attitude and being together in a double movement of resignation from the world and union with meaning; this movement literally makes sense out of reality. It therefore bears comparison to the treatment of distanciation in contemporary hermeneutics, where detachment is a key condition of understanding. By investigating Losev's connections to other Russian thinkers, the author makes a case for a distinct Russian tradition of hermeneutic philosophy (V. Ivanov, G. Shpet, A. Bakshy, A. Losev).<br>

Abstract: The political vicissitudes endured by Leopoldo Lugones through both his attitudes and writings are described in this paper. On the one hand, his initial political Utopia reflected in the American post-romanticism, with a leader as Ruben Dario, progressive for the period. As of 1910, the political situation of an Argentina with masses largely integrated by foreingners, and with the social burdens they carry have turned him towards a feeling of the reality of his country, which is dominated by English imperialism. In 1938, faced with the impossibility of changing this reality, Lugones commits suicide. /// Las vicisitudes políticas sufridas por Leopoldo Lugones a través de sus actitudes y escritos se describen en este trabajo. En primer lugar su inicial utopía política reflejada en el post romanticismo americano, con un líder como Rubén Dario, progresista para la época. A partir de 1910, la situación política de una Argentina cuyas masas se integran con extranjeros en gran parte, y con las cargas sociales que ellas traen, lo vuelcan hacia un sentimiento de la realidad de su país, que se halla dominado por el imperialismo inglés. En 1838, ante la imposibilidad de modificar esa realidad, Lugones se suicida.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The contribution outlines a research programme which I have coined the "sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse). This approach to discourse integrates important insights of FOUCAULT's theory of discourse into the interpretative paradigm in the social sciences, especially the "German" approach of hermeneutic sociology of knowledge (Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie). Accordingly, in this approach discourses are considered as "structured and structuring structures" which shape social practices of enunciation. Unlike some Foucauldian approaches, this form of discourse analysis recognises the importance of socially constituted actors in the social production and circulation of knowledge. Furthermore, it combines research questions related to the concept of "discourse" with the methodical toolbox of qualitative social research. Going beyond questions of language in use, "the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse) addresses sociological interests, the analyses of social relations and politics of knowledge as well as the discursive construction of reality as an empirical ("material") process. For empirical research on discourse the approach proposes the use of analytical concepts from the sociology of knowledge tradition, such as interpretative schemes or frames (Deutungsmuster), "classifications", "phenomenal structure" (Phänomenstruktur), "narrative structure", "dispositif" etc., and the use of the methodological strategies of "grounded theory".<br>

Abstract: Dans Les aventures de la dialectique, Merleau-Ponty s'appuie sur Weber pour se défaire du marxisme et juger la réalité du communisme. Mais le parcours qu'il effectue est complexe et sinueux, comme le montre notamment le chapitre sur Lukács: la volonté de Merleau-Ponty de rétablir une critique sans restriction et la netteté de sa rupture politique avec le communisme font contraste avec sa difficulté à rompre avec la dialectique. In Les Aventures de la dialectique, Merleau-Ponty uses Weber to break with marxism and to judge the reality of communism. But he follows a complex and sinuous path, as shown in the chapter about Lukacs: Merleau-Ponty's will to restaure a free criticism and the clearness of his political rupture with communism contrast with his difficulty in renouncing dialectic.<br>

Author(s): Chenavier Robert<br>
Abstract: Au cours d'une période qui voit Husserl livrer son testament philosophique, la Krisis, l'étudiante Simone Weil ouvre son Diplôme d'études supérieures, en 1930, par le constat du désarroi dans lequel se trouve l'époque et de l'incertitude dans laquelle nous laisse la science. Il faut opérer un retour à Descartes, dans une automéditation proche de celle que recommandait Husserl. Cependant Simone Weil ne s'oriente pas vers une phénoménologie. Loin d'explorer la sphère d'être du cogito, elle cherche à en sortir, plus rapidement encore que Descartes, pour rencontrer la réalité du monde, et inventer une sagesse pour notre condition d'être percevant, ce qui signifie, avant tout, d'être qui travaille. Seul le travail permet d'éprouver la nécessité réelle, et de retrouver « l'union de l'âme et du monde », dans les conditions créées par l'industrie. C'est dans la ligne de la vocation mondaine de la philosophie de Descartes, que Simone Weil amorce sa réflexion sur le rôle du travail comme fondement d'une sagesse, dans ces nouvelles conditions d'existence déterminées par la forme collective de la production. À partir de 1935, elle verra dans la crise un signe de la « faillite de Descartes ». During the period that Husserl was declaring his philosophical testament, Die Krisis, Simone Weil was a student starting her Diplôme d'études supérieures in 1930, mindful of the utter confusion of the times and of the atmosphere of uncertainty generated by science. One must return to Descartes, in a self-meditation similar to the one recommended by Husserl. But Simone Weil did not move toward a phenomenology. Far from exploring the sphere of being through the cogito principle, she sought to escape from that sphere, even more rapidly than did Descartes, in order to confront the reality of the world and to invent a wisdom for the condition of a conscious being, which means, above all, a being who works. Only work makes it possible to experience real necessity and to reestablish « the union of~<br>

Abstract: This close reading of one poem by Dickinson, « Crisis is sweet », wishes to demonstrate that the poet makes us share in a multiple experience of crisis combining sexual climax, mystical revelation, and the destruction of the poetic image. Positing a multi-level definition of crisis, the poem shows that the very process of definition — undoubtedly one of Dickinson's preferred modes of tackling with reality — entails a fundamental crisis and criticism of representation.<br>

Author(s): Youniss James<br>
Abstract: This paper offers a discussion of contemporary theories of moral development. At present, these theories are at odds regarding the origins of morality. One camp has proposed a cognitive basis, while the other claims that morality consists in affectivity. Both these positions are discussed, and a third alternative is proposed for their resolution, based upon the model of the subject within communicative relations, whose life involves constructing reality through social procedures with others. This model is described and contrasted with the model of the self-reflecting individual which seems to underlie most current theories. In addition, a number of studies are reviewed in order to show more clearly how this third alternative provides insight into the social basis of moral judgment. Throughout the paper, two themes remain central: (a) that rationality can be considered to result from consensual validation which is obtained through communication; and (b) that sense of community, the grounds for moral action, is not incompatible with establishing or maintaining one's own individual identity.<br>

Author(s): Shalin Dmitri N.<br>
Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Publisher: The University of Nebraska Press<br>

Date: 7 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Gordon Rae Beth<br>
Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Abstract: By incorporating the battle of Waterloo into the events of their novels, Hugo and Stendhal create a portrait of its principal protagonist, Napoléon ler. Associated in one case with a spatial prison out of time and in the other case with a temporal exile out of space, the image of the emperor is that of a figure of power deprived of time and, consequently, of its legitimacy. Stendhal imprisons his character in the present to deny the reality of Napoleon's defeat. Hugo, on the other hand, exiles his character from the present to link the past to the future and propose a new model of heroism.<br>

Abstract: This Study is divided in three parts. The first treats the problem of the relation between Scripture and reason considered as Springs of Moral Theology. Why a recourse to Bible should be necessary if conscience is already a Spring of moral knowledge? What kind of Priority has, for christian conscience, the Authority of the Gospel? The answer is that the light of the Gospel and the light of Reason are not two independant possibilities: there is interaction and complementarity between them: both Scripture and human Reason can be said to be, together, the soul of Moral Theology. The second part is about Hermeneutics. How can we apply the written Gospel to every day's reality? Exegesis tells me what the biblical text is saying: the text speaks. Hermeneutics tells me what the biblical text is saying to the modern man: the text speaks today. Hermeneutics try to liberate the actual meaning of the biblical text. In the third Part, the dialectic between faith and reason is applied to the moral of S. Paul. What was Paul's Filter in front of hellenism? How did he manage to borrow some principles of morality from the current morality and to refuse some others? What was his originality? How did he use Faith and Reason in building up his moral doctrine?<br>

Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Abstract: "Teaching" and "science" are notions that cannot be applied univocally to theology. Teaching implies that the mind masters its object scientifically through human methods; but who can master the knowledge which God alone possesses? There is need for God's Word himself to become Teacher (John 1,18). Thus, in the schools the sacra pagina will open itself up to become sacra doctrina. The method of theology is therefore always subordinate to a transcendent knowledge which finally remains inaccessible to any merely human science. Is science thereby degraded or on the contrary enhanced? Thomas Aquinas developed the idea of «subalternation». Blondel spoke of a science based on Christ «verified and realised in us». Today hermeneutics discovers that only the Glory of ultimate reality is capable of giving meaning to all the figures that announce it in human history and knowledge. On the other hand, the avatars of nominalism show that reducing theology and science to univocity results in perverting science as such.<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: L'article aborde la question de l'universalisation que l'on attend du processus actuel de mondialisation, qui unifie la planète sur la base de l'économie du marché. Sous la poussée de la rationalité scientifique, la mondialisation réalise une universalisation de moyens susceptibles d'ouvrir potentiellement à toute l'humanité l'accès à des biens élémentaires qui améliorent son bien-être en libérant du besoin. On remarque toutefois que, sous l'influence de l'idéologie néolibérale, la prédominance de la dimension économique invertit la mondialisation en un projet instrumental de la part de ceux qui considèrent toute réalité, y compris l'homme, comme un moyen. La mondialisation produit ainsi une universalisation rationnelle qui concerne les choses ou les moyens, et non les hommes. Loin donc de réaliser la véritable universalisation de l'humanité, elle en pose tout au plus les conditions matérielles d'avènement et laisse de côté le problème crucial de la reconnaissance de l'homme par l'homme. The article addresses the question of the universalisation that can be expected from the current process of globalisation, which unifies the planet on the basis of the market economy. Propelled by scientific rationality, globalisation is producing a universalisation of resources that has the potential of providing all of humanity access to those basic goods which increase wellbeing by eliminating need. Nonetheless, it is observed that, under the influence of neoliberal ideology, the predominance of the economic dimension transforms globalisation into a project used by those who consider all reality, including human beings, as a means. Globalisation thus produces a rational universalisation that impacts things and resources but not human beings. Far from bringing about a true universalisation of humanity, globalisation at the most sets the material conditions of access but leaves to the side the crucial problem of the mutual recognition of man for man.<br>

Abstract: Può la psicologia contribuire in qualche modo ad avvicinarsi alle domande fondamentali della vita? La psicologia potrebbe essere e di fatto è spesso vista ed utilizzata come tecnica. In realtà ogni psicologia porta in se stessa dei semi più o meno sviluppati di una antropologia, così come ogni antropologia non può non avere una componente pedagogico/psicologica. Senza pretese di completezza l'articolo suscita alcune domande circa la inevitabile integrazione tra gli aspetti psicologici e le dimensioni fondamentali dell'essere quali la verità da conoscere, il bene per cui impegnarsi e l'unità o armonia che si trova alla base delle motivazioni umane. Il tutto non riesce a sottrarsi alla dimensione/missione pedagogica ricordando che la questione più che sul 'che' o il 'se', è piuttosto sul 'Quale' o sul 'come'. Can psychology contribute in some way to the approach to the fundamental questions of life? Psychology can be and indeed often is seen and used as a technique. In reality, every psychology carries in itself the seeds, more or less developed, of an anthropology, just as every anthropology cannot but have a pedagogical/psychological component. Without claiming to be comprehensive, the article raises some questions concerning the unavoidable integration of psychological aspects with the fundamental dimensions of being, such as the truth to be known, the good to be worked for, and the unity or harmony found at the basis of human motivations. All this cannot disregard the pedagogical dimension/mission, recalling that the question is not 'what' or 'if' but rather 'which one' and 'how'.<br>

Abstract: Cet article à la fois historiographique et programmatique commence par un rappel du dénigrement dont l'histoire politique a longtemps souffert. Ces dernières années ont été celles d'un indéniable renouveau avec l'affirmation d'une histoire culturelle du politique qui est restée, depuis, très dynamique, l'ouverture élargie sur les autres champs historiques ou encore l'établissement de liens plus étroits avec les autres sciences humaines et sociales qui a même pu produire de nouvelles hybridations. Il est temps que le vœu formulé voilà deux décennies par René Rémond pour que naisse une histoire politique totale se concrétise. This article of historiography is programmatic too. It starts by stating the discredit from which political history has long suffered. The last few years have experienced a definite renewal with the assertion of a very dynamic cultural history of politics, a broad opening on other historical fields as well as the strengthening of closer links with other Human and Social Sciences which has contributed to new hybridizations. Two decades ago, René Rémond made an appeal on behalf of a total political history and it is high time this initiative became reality.<br>

Abstract: Situé au nord ouest de la Chine et base de la guérilla communiste avant même l'arrivée de Mao Zédong en 1935, Yan'an a longtemps constitué, officiellement du moins, l'instant de pureté morale de la révolution chinoise. Les événements de la place Tiananmen en juin 1989, moment certes éphémère, ont définitivement mis fin au mythe de Yan'an, même si la réalité de cette révolution avait disparu bien avant. A son époque, Yan'an rayonna vers toutes les bases révolutionnaires et à travers toute la Chine, et ce, malgré le contexte de guerre et de révolution. Ce fut le moment de transition entre l'échec et le succès à la fois pour Mao Zédong en personne à travers son ascension au sein du Parti communiste chinois et pour le Parti lui-même. Les mots et la langue furent, à cet égard et plus que toute autre chose, d'une importance cruciale. "Faiseur de mythe", conteur, architecte moral, créant à la fois la logique et le texte de la révolution, Mao parvint à symboliser le discours hégémonique de la révolution chinoise comme l'unique culture politique possible. Les luttes pour le pouvoir menées par Mao s'articulèrent sur la prétention au monopole d'un "cosmos" défini par luimême autour d'une idéologie (le marxisme sinisé), d'un pouvoir de domination militaire, d'un pouvoir administratif, et d'un pouvoir intellectuel. Mao utilisa en effet ces quatre dimensions pour asseoir son autorité avec un savant mélange de finesse analytique et tactique que l'on retrouve aussi dans ses textes. Mais il se heurta à des compétiteurs à l'intérieur même du PCC. Aussi chacune de ces luttes révèle-t-elle une dimension différente du processus de monopolisation. Chacune était nécessaire mais même ensemble, elles étaient insuffisantes, en l'absence de l'ingrédient final, le capital symbolique. Situated in China's Northwest, and communist guerrilla base before Mao arrived, Yan'an hab been constituted during a long time, officially at least, the moral moment of the chinese revolution. The events of Tianan~<br>

Abstract: במסגרת המחקר נבחנו המאפיינים והמשמעויות של מאה ואחת מפות של ישראל שנוצרו בין השנים 1978-2001 ונעשה ניסיון לבדוק מהם הנושאים בעלי הזיקה לדת, הבאים לידי ביטוי במפות אלו. שיטת המחקר היתה איכותנית: הרמנויטיקה, המוגדרת באופן חופשי, כתיאוריה או פילוסופיה של מתן משמעות לדברים על ידי פירושם ומטרתה היא להבין ולפרש שפה וטקסט. באמצעות גישה זו נבדקו הנושאים הקשורים לדתות, צורות ההצגה שלהם, הדימויים והסיפרים (נרטיבים) של המפות. במפות זוהה 'סיפר דתי' שנמצא לרוב נוגד ל'סיפר החילוני'. בתוך ה'סיפר הדתי הקדוש' בולט במיוחד ה'סיפר הנוצרי'. סממנים בודדים נמצאו כתואמים את ה'סיפר היהודי' ואילו ה'סיפר המוסלמי' לא בא כלל לידי ביטוי. זאת אפילו במפות בעלות 'סיפר פלשתינאי' הנוצר על ידי מוציאים לאור ברשות הפלשתינאית או במדינות אחרות. ברבות מהמפות האלו נעדרו אלמנטים ונושאים פוליטיים כמו מיפוי גבולות, שטחי אש, מעברי גבול ושמות מדינות ואזורים הגובלים בישראל. נראה כי מפות בעלות מאפיינים דתיים הן בעלות מעמד כרטוגרפי מיוחד בשל הניסיון שלהן לשלב מציאות עכשווית עם מסורת של מפות עתיקות והן מאפשרות להסיק מסקנות אודות מסרי המפה והאידאולוגיה שלה. One hundred and one current maps of Israel were analyzed for their mode of mapping religious elements related to the Holy Land. The main issues of the study were to find out the religious elements that appear in a wide range of maps and their form of representation, the impressions conveyed by the different maps, and the narratives construed from this representation. The applied research methods were hermeneutics and semiotics. Most of the narratives identified in the various maps emphasized the 'holy' versus the 'secular'; the 'holy Christian' narrative, the Jewish narrative, and the Muslim narrative. The Christian narrative proved the most dominant, while the Muslim narrative was rarely found, even in maps with a 'Palestinian' narrative. Religious maps evinced a special cartographic status because of their subjective nature and their attempt to combine contemporary reality with traditional maps of the ancient Holy Land. A ubiquitous finding was the disregard of ~<br>

Abstract: En Palestine, chaque année au mois d'avril, a lieu le pèlerinage musulman de Moïse (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ). Située dans le désert, entre Jérusalem et Jéricho, la tombe du prophète rassemble autour d'elle des pèlerins venus de l'ensemble de la Cisjordanie. Ce lieu de mémoire collective fixe et rappelle un événement lointain rapporté par la tradition musulmane : la mort de Moïse. Dans le même temps, il suscite des questionnements en chaîne : le législateur des Hébreux est-il mort dans ce lieu? Ou, comme le stipule la Bible, dans un endroit inconnu des hommes? Estil d'ailleurs vraiment mort? Son corps est-il là? Etc. Ces questions, qui portent sur les circonstances et la réalité de l'événement, reviennent à s'interroger ici et maintenant sur la présence d'un intercesseur efficace entre les hommes et Dieu. Elles sont donc étroitement liées à une problématique plus large, celle de savoir comment construire l'accessibilité et le contact avec un « ailleurs invisible », ce Dieu transcendant et lointain que l'islam propose à l'instar du judaïsme et du christianisme. Dans cet article je propose d'explorer l'indécision qui est le corollaire de cette longue série de questionnements ne trouvant aucune réponse définitive. In Palestine every year in the month of April, the Muslim pilgrimage of Moses (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ) takes place. Located in the desert between Jerusalem and Jericho, the grave of the Prophet gathers pilgrims from the entire West Bank. This place of collective memory fixes and recalls a distant event reported by Muslim tradition: the death of Moses. At the same time, it raises questions: did the Hebrew legislator die there? Or, as stated in the Bible, in a place unknown to men? Is he really dead? Is his body there? Etc. These questions, which relate to the circumstances and the reality of the event amounts to question here and now the presence of an effective intercessor between man and God. They are closely related to a larger issue, that of how to build accessibi~<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: Albert Camus's interrogation of the ethical and spiritual vacuity of the twentieth century convinced him that authentic political existence requires a vision that embraces while transcending the human condition. He found his ethical model in art. The work of the artist can be analogous to that of the just political actor. The principal components of ethical political being are all present in Camus's aesthetics: a vision of life in human community (lucidity), a grounded sense of justice subject to the limitations of human existence (beauty), a need to redress the defects of political reality (the urge to create), and an understanding that any structural solution is of necessity temporary (the need to rearticulate the initial vision). Camus's vision requires him to reject our positive political categories in the name of creative, grounded human being.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>

Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Abstract: Ulanov, p. 46: "'Archetype' is a symbolic concept. It conceptualizes our experience, but it is
not a mere nominalistic designation. It has the symbolic function to mediate to consciousness the
objective reality of the psyche that is not directly accessible to our sensory perception or to our
logical reason. Archetypes symbolize the life of the nonindividual psyche that we all experience
but which is not our personal possession. We feel the drive effect of the archetype, its emotional
patterns and images, but we do not experience the archetype per se because 'an archetypal
content expresses itself, first and foremost, in metaphors'".<br>

Abstract: Este artigo contém uma leitura em contraponto: a noção de situação em Simone de Beauvoir e a de intersecções em Donna Haraway expressariam supostos relacionais; mulher estaria para Beauvoir como ciborgue está para Haraway; Beauvoir distingue a situação das mulheres, dos judeus e dos negros, considerando a relação entre situações e consciências históricas e|ou biológicas. A biologia aparece em situação como construção mítica de uma identidade a ser ultrapassada para a constituição do sujeito; em Haraway, o ciborgue seria uma narrativa sobre como o biológico e a realidade social de raça e gênero situam-se em uma rede de interações, informação e semiologia. Relação e constituição do "objeto", temas caros à teoria social, seriam instituídos em (e pela) alteridade sem a dicotomia dura entre realidade e ficção, natureza e cultura, literatura e ciência. In this article I will present a counterpoint between notions of 'situation' by Simone de Beauvoir and 'intersections' by Donna Haraway, which express ideas of relation. I will argue that woman for Beauvoir is like cyborg for Haraway. Beauvoir distinguishes the situation of women, Jews and blacks by considering the relationship between situations and historical consciousness and | or biological weapons. For Beauvoir, the biology in situation appears as construction of a mythical identity to be overcome for the formation of the subject. Alternatively, Haraway uses the cyborg as a narrative of how the biological and social reality of race and gender are into a network of interactions, information and semiology. With this claiming for alterity inside the relation and constitution of the "object", both authors bring important challenges to two of the most important issues of social theory. Moreover, they do it without the hard dichotomy between reality and fiction, nature and culture, literature and science.<br>

Abstract: The philosopher as the tormented individual trying to grasp the truth is the topic of Giordano Bruno's Eroici furori. This paper offers a reading that assumes that Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises were part of its cultural background. Both texts have some features in common: the individual struggles for contemplation of the absolute; the strife is a circular movement within the human condition; Ignatius and Bruno suggest to employ the lower realms of reality and the lower faculties of the soul for the sake of their overcoming in truth. Consequently, dialogue, imagery, and emblematic contraptions of multiple senses are specifically apt to educate the individual. Bruno addresses systematically the epistemological and metaphysical problems that accompany the Exercises.<br>

Abstract: Polish literary theory developed very quickly in the 1960's and 1970's. Its main field of research is structure of literary works, including versology, stylistics, narrative, literary communication, descriptive and historical poetics. It was mostly inspired by phenomenology and Roman Ingarden, a disciple of Husserl and founder of phenomenological theory of literary work, which focused on the intentional structure of literary work and its concretization by readers. The second important source of inspiration for Polish literary theory was structuralism, including Russian Formalism, the Prague Circle and original Polish literary researches before the Second World War. After 1989 the entire field of literary theory in Poland was deeply changed. Formalist perspective was replaced by research concentrated on broad cultural, political, and economical contexts of literature, its ideological determinations as well as forms of symbolic power reflected in a literary work. Literature itself is no more treated as structure or text, but rather as discourse, reflecting and at the same time forming social reality. Analytical tools are mainly provided by French poststructuralist theory, hermeneutics, pragmatism, American cultural studies, feminism and postcolonialism. Inspirée par deux tendances prédominantes : la phénoménologie (dont le représentant le plus important a été Roman Ingarden, disciple de Husserl et fondateur de la théorie phénoménologique de l'œuvre littéraire, centrée sur la structure intentionnelle de l'œuvre et sa concrétisation par le lecteur) et le structuralisme (y compris les influences venues du formalisme russe, de l'École de Prague, ainsi que des recherches polonaises menées avant la Seconde Guerre mondiale), la théorie de la littérature en Pologne s'est développée très rapidement dans les années 60 et 70. Elle s'est intéressée à la structure de l'œuvre littéraire (versologie, stylistique, narration, communication littéraire, poétique descriptive et historiqu~<br>

Abstract: Intensive care and the intensive care techniques in use have considerably changed our attitude towards death and dying –a process that had already been medicalized and professionalized. This study of four intensive care units (ICUs) in France and Britain brings to light the reality of death-related practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relations and personal experience. Study results strongly suggest that the end-of-life decision is a genuine social construction: far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by extremely heterogeneous types of logic. This study shows that patient's death in an ICU is more dependant on the organization and culture of the ICU than on patient's own wishes or those of close relatives.<br>

Author(s): Tengelyi László<br>
Abstract: Truth is attributed by hermeneutical phenomenology not only to science but also to art and literature. According to Ricoeur, its veritable bearer is the expression of experience that can take artistic and literary forms as well as scientific ones. However, truth in this sense cannot be defined as a correspondence with a ready-made reality, nor can it be reduced to any internal coherence in our knowledge of the world. What is, then, its precise meaning in this context? The two terms mentioned in the title—'redescription' and 'refiguration' of reality—indicate the two answers Ricoeur gives to this question. The similarities and the differences between these two answers are submitted to an inquiry in the following paper, which, relying upon Ricoeur, adumbrates the outlines of a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach to truth.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24659507<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Jung Hwa Yol<br>
Abstract: This essay advances the concept of transversality by drawing philosophical insights from Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Calvin O. Schrag, and the Martinicuan francophone Edouard Glissant. By so doing, it begins with a critique of the notion of universality in modern Western philosophy. It targets Hegel—the modernist incarnate—in particular, who had a dark view of the non-Western world. His overarching Eurocentric universality is founded on the fallacious premise that what is particular in the West is universalized or universalizable, whereas what is particular in the non-West remains particular forever. As Glissant puts it succinctly, however, thinking about "One" is not thinking about "All" or "Many." Eurocentric universality is outmoded and thus has no place in the globalization of the multicultural world. It simply ignores the reality of interlacing of multiple life-worlds. The concept of transversality, which is symbolized in the Maitreyan Middle Way, is proposed to replace universality, which tends to be nothing but the philosophical expression of a particular socio-cultural life-world. It not only reduces ethnocentric ignorance but also fosters a hybridity that in fact dissolves the binary opposition between particularism and universalism. In short, transversality is conceived of as a new paradigm in philosophical conceptualization or world philosophy. What is traditionally called "comparative philosophy" is not just a neglected branch of philosophy, but it is poised to transform radically the very conception of philosophy itself.<br>

Abstract: Les liens entre anthropologie et histoire, qui ont été très forts depuis les années 1960, semblent parfois se distendre depuis deux décennies. À partir d'un point de vue localisé, celui d'un historien des derniers siècles du Moyen Âge, cet article cherche à s'interroger sur la réalité actuelle des formes d'échange scientifique entre les deux disciplines. Tout en rappelant l'importance de l'anthropologie historique et des objets de recherche partagés par les historiens et les anthropologues, il cherche à mettre en évidence une autre perspective de travail, en montrant comment les interrogations des anthropologues sur l'historicité, sur la forme et le statut de l'information recueillie durant leur travail de terrain, ou sur leur propre engagement subjectif par rapport à ce terrain, offrent aux historiens, qui sont confrontés à des questionnements parallèles, des ressources nouvelles pour prolonger la fécondité des échanges interdisciplinaires. The links between anthropology and history have been very tight since the 1960s but seem to have loosened during the past two decades. From a very « localized » viewpoint as a historian of the latter part of the Middle Ages, questions are raised about the current reality of forms of scientific exchanges between these two disciplines. While recalling the importance of historical anthropology and of subjects of research shared by historians and anthropologists, another perspective of work is opened by showing how anthropologists' interrogations about historicity, the form and status of the information gathered during fieldwork, or about their own subjective commitments in relation to the field, provide historians, who face parallel interrogations, with new resources for fertilizing multidisciplinary exchanges.<br>

Abstract: In Reformational philosophy the term 'structure' can be used in two different senses: It could
refer to the factual or subject-side of reality and is then used in the sense of the structure of
reality. It could also refer to the law-side of reality, i.e. the structural laws governing and
conditioning the regularities perceived in phenomena. Then it is understood in the sense of the
structure for reality. When the term 'structure mapping' is used in this article it refers primarily
to the latter sense of the term, although it is conceded that analysis of the structures for reality
are inextricably bound to the analysis of the structures of reality.<br>

Abstract: Dooyeweerd recognizes the problem, to be sure, when he asks, 'Is sinful reality still mean-

philosophy'. But the answer follows, without restriction and without hesitation, on the same
page: 'Sinful reality remains apostate meaning under the law and under the curse of God's
wrath' (A New Critique, vol. 2, p. 33). The 'Why?' of the Crucified One and so many cross
bearers finds no echo here.<br>

Abstract: Pluralistic' labels not only a particular view of the world, of society, or of morality. People
are also in the habit of attaching the name to the object under considération. One then speaks
of a pluralistic reality, a pluralistic church, a pluralistic ethos, and so forth. The word 'plural'
or 'pluriform' would in such cases seem more appropriate. Yet what is one to do when James
already spoke of a 'pluralistic universe'? In this essay I use 'pluralism' and 'pluralistic' in the
primary sense of the terms, i.e., as characteristic of a particular view or theory.<br>

coming and supra-temporal generation had a pre-existence in the Spirit of God; it exists as
created, as finished creation. It is this finished existing creation that now becomes in the great
becoming process." (Structure, p. 66f., cf. p. 52f.) One might wish to ask, then: What is the
supra-temporal existence of the soul? (On the concept of aevum, or created eternity, in
Dooyeweerd, see his "Het tijdsprobleem en zijn antinomieën op het immanentie-standpunt,"
Philosophia reformata 4 (1939), 4-5; cited by Steen, Structure, p. 132, n. 9).<br>

Abstract: The background of this is the dilemma between substantialism (starting out from the
primacy of substance over relation) versus funnlionalism (where function or relation is primary
over substance). According to Dooyeweerd there is a third, Berkouwer says, namely that "the
relation does not in the least threaten, dim or dissolve reality; rather, it makes it possible to
understand the nature of this reality in its relatedness to God." In other words, if some hold
that a relational view of man does not adequately portray the 'reality', i.e., the ontic status of
being-human, they betray that they are still enslaved to a view in which substances are too
much seen as self-sufficient. But if relations and substances should not be played out over
against each other, the implication is that the supra-temporal heart, too, exists in a 'relational-
ontic' sense. It is not surprising therefore that Blosser interprets Berkouwer's comment as a
plea for a mitigated substance-thinking, in other words, as a thinking that admits the existence
of substances, though without ascribing self-sufficiency to them. See Blosser (1993, 205-08) and
Evans (1993).<br>

Abstract: Broad definitions are often used in Christian apologetics. One example: 'Everyone has a
worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Article Title: Hayden White: Beyond Irony<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): White Ewa<br>
Abstract: A crisis of our age that is usually identified with the loss of the sacred was one of the causes of the fall into irony in the nineteenth century. In the case of historians, as Hayden White has shown in Metahistory, this irony was caused by a "bitterness" stemming from the failure of reality to fulfill their expectations. An ironic apprehension of the world arose in an atmosphere of social breakdown or cultural decline. A current stage of irony manifests itself in a doubt as to the capacity of language to grasp reality. Thus we live in a "prison house of language." An intellectual parlor-game produces "second-hand knowledge" that cannot satisfy the needs of post-postmodern men and women still looking for another metanarrative. Therefore, the main purpose of this essay is to answer the question: how can we go beyond irony? This text is a "post-postmodern post mortem to postmodernism." I am grateful to post-modernism for many things, especially for giving me an alternative apprehension of the world in terms of difference and continuity rather than binary oppositions, but I am tired of ontological insecurity and epistemological chaos. I need order. I miss metanarrative. In trying to break with some modern/postmodern "principles" and retain within my discourse the premodernist perspective, I follow the current trend in the humanities. We observe at present the breakdown of methodology and the rise of a more poetic approach in the human sciences. Evidence of this phenomenon is the more autobiographical form of writing in anthropology (James Clifford, Clifford Geertz) and a more literary style in historical writing (Natalie Zemon Davis, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Simon Schama). This trend is associated with a revaluation of the subjective aspects of research. Perhaps, and I would welcome it, it also could be identified with a reappearance of a Collingwoodian idea of history as human self-knowledge, knowledge about human nature, knowledge about "what it is to be a man... wha~<br>

Article Title: The New Annalistic: A Sketch of a Theory of History<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342990<br>
Date: 10 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Nipperdey Lucian<br>
Abstract: This article argues for the establishment of a new, "annalistic" model of history and historical investigation. This implies a new concept of historical event: instead of being seen as an element within a historical narrative, the historical event is defined as the common reference point of many narratives that can be told about it. The annalistic model also implies a new concept of historical change: instead of being defined as the change of an "object" within a set of given historical parameters, historical change has to be perceived as the change of parameters related to a given historical object. A new concept of history follows from the annalistic model: instead of history being a metaphysical unity of space and time (the destiny of mankind, the positivist's world of facts), in which everything is linked to everything, it is instead the product of historical judgment carried out by those who design stories about their own past, present, and future. To the "annalist" a world is imaginable in which no history has existed, exists, or will exist. The article analyzes three aspects of the concept of historical time: it demonstrates the huge variety of temporal structures in history; it argues for the foundation of the representation of historical time in linguistic concepts; and it discusses the relationship of fictionality and reality in historical discourse. Finally, the annalistic model is compared to the traditional concept of history established by historicism in the nineteenth century.<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342969<br>
Date: 5 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Bernstein Cushing<br>
Abstract: Simon Schama's Dead Certainties is assessed in the light of the complex relationship between history and fiction, which share some limited common territory. Examples are cited from Mary Chesnut, Oscar Handlin, Georg Lukács, Herman Melville, Robert Penn Warren, P. D. James, and Wallace Stegner. Schama's book has some kinship to the skepticism found in "the new historicism" and "deconstruction," but also has its own differences from the fashionable "inverted positivism" which concludes that since evidence is not an open window on reality, it must be a wall precluding access to it. Only two of Schama's three narratives cohere, and while uncertainty may be a common theme, his historian's judgment tends to dissipate much of the mystery his fictionalizing technique creates. His idea of historical uncertainty arises from a fallacy that a "communion with the dead" (as in Henry James's The Sense of the Past), possible only for a time-traveler, represents authentic knowledge. Affirming that asking questions and relating narratives are not mutually exclusive, Schama joins the company of philosophers (Collingwood, Dray, Mink, Ricoeur) and historians (Hexter, John Lukacs, Veyne, and Strout) who have also made this case.<br>

Abstract: Why should past occurrences matter to us as such? Are they in fact meaningful in a specifically historical way, or do they only become meaningful in being connected to other sorts of meaning-political or speculative, for example-as many notable theorists imply? Ranke and Oakeshott affirmed a purely historical meaningfulness but left its nature unclear. The purpose of this essay is to confirm historical meaningfulness by arguing that our commanding practical interest in how we share action with other actors is distinctively engaged by presumed information about past occurrences. We recognize that past occurrences have determined the conditions of action sharing, constraining our practice with regard to which actors we share practical reality with and which compounding actions we may or must join in progress.<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>
Issue: i25479101<br>
Date: 7 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Soroka Mykola Iv.<br>
Abstract: Because of the close association between ideology and utopia, Volodymyr Vynnychenko's three-volume utopian novel "Soniachna mashyna" (1921-24, published in 1928), one of the most well known and discussed works in Ukrainian literature, has more often been approached as a product of his political and ideological preoccupations. While I do not disregard this, in my paper I propose a new reading from a largely neglected perspective of geographical displacement as a social, cultural and psychological phenomenon in an effort to bring fresh theoretical insight into the study of utopian writings. It maintains that Vynnychenko's utopia was largely inspired by his involuntary stay outside his homeland, in Germany, which led to a state of existential uncertainty, feelings of extreme uprootedness, and the desire to overcome this conflict with the reality of his day. The paper examines the writer's personal attitude to his displacement and uses the theoretical paradigm of utopia and nostalgia to argue that his utopia was aimed at a 'reconstruction' of his highly unstable identity by transcending the intolerable present and a projection of a better future.<br>

Abstract: In 'The Uncanny', Freud does not distinguish between psychotic pathologies and
narcissistic ones, seeming to regard them as one category. As Olsen and Koppe explain,
Freud 'found that most of the traits [of psychoses], that is, self-centeredness, lack of
libidinous object cathexis, the loss of the sense of reality, and domination of primary pro-
cesses, were related to their narcissistic mode'. They add that 'what in particular distin-
guishes the neuroses from the psychoses is their reliance on the defense mechanisms of
projection and denial in contrast to repression'. See O. Olsen and S. Koppe, Freud's
Theory of Psychoanalysis, trans. J.C. Delay and C. Pedersen (New York, 1988),
pp. 244-5. However, Freud's classification of psychic illnesses changed with the intro-
duction of the super-ego. In 'Neurosis and Psychosis' (1923), Freud argues that 'Trans-
ference neuroses correspond to a conflict between the ego and the id; narcissistic neuro-
ses [such as melancholia], to a conflict between the ego and the super-ego; and psycho-
ses, to one between the ego and the external world' (XIX, p. 152). This distinction is
problematic, since Freud claims that part of the demands of the external world is repre-
sented by the super-ego. In any event, in my discussion below I will continue to refer to
projection as a psychotic defence with narcissistic motivations.<br>

Abstract: Albert Camus's political philosophy of rebellion and limits is ultimately grounded in an aesthetic theory, which in turn is dependent on a broader understanding of the nature of symbols. In his essays and notes. Camus develops a theory of symbols in which he insists that human beings are symbolic creatures and that human experience and symbolization are interdependent realities. Camus felt that art, in particular the philosophical novel, played a significant role in the rearticulation of symbols. The basis of the recollection or the creation of symbols is the consciousness of the community, particularly the shared consciousness of the human condition. Symbols act as mediations between the empirical world and the world of imagination. They are not literal descriptions of that empirical reality, nor are they simply flights of fancy. Symbols are necessarily bound and free. So, too, Camus argues, must be the politics on which they are based.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i345910<br>
Date: 12 1, 1756<br>
Author(s): Tulard Jay M.<br>
Abstract: Experience has recently reemerged as an important analytical category for historians of the Old Regime and the French Revolution. Reacting against the perceived excesses of discourse analysis, which made political language independent of any social determinants, certain post-revisionists are now seeking to contextualize political language by relating it to the experience of those who use it. Political agency, in these analyses, is understood to be the effect of particular formative experiences. This article suggests that the search for an experiential antidote to discourse is misconceived because it perpetuates an untenable dichotomy between thought and reality. Access to the phenomenon of historical agency should be pursued not through experience or discourse but through the category of consciousness, since the make-up of the subject's consciousness determines how he/she engages the world and decides to attempt changing it. After a brief discussion of an important study that exemplifies both the allure and the functionality of the notion of experience, Timothy Tackett's Becoming a Revolutionary, the article focuses on the evolving political consciousness of a man who became a revolutionary agitator in 1789, J.-M.-A. Servan. Analysis of his writings between 1770 and 1789 shows that the way in which his perspective was constructed, rather than the lessons of experience per se, determined the shape of his revolutionary intentions in 1789.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Author(s): Watson-Gegeo Karen Ann<br>
Abstract: Two traditions have been vying for supremacy in the area of cultural analysis. The first sees culture as encompassing the totality of socially learned human phenomena; the second restricts the term to shared mental-primarily cognitive-properties. David Schneider has achieved a dominant positon in the latter school. In this paper I examine critically Schneider's approach to culture, with special attention to the problems raised by his perspective with respect to intracultural consistency and contradiction. While agreeing that the ethnographer must attempt to shun prior assumptions as to the nature of symbolic and conceptual domains recognized by the people under study, that it is incumbent on the anthropologist to comprehend reality from the natives' point of view before attempting to formulate laws or generalizations, that the symbolic systems and their associated meanings plays an essential part in making sense of any human action system, I shall argue that cultures do not exhibit the degree of integration, consistency, and articulation assumed by Schneider, that in his attempt to render culture wholly integrated and consisten he strips the concept of its analytic utility, that social action and symbolic systems are empirically and epistemologically more closely intertwined than he would lead us to believe, and that the very debate over what culture "really" is constitutes an exercise in reification.<br>

Abstract: I begin with the assumption that a philosophically significant tension exists today in feminist philosophy of religion between those subjects who seek to become divine and those who seek their identity in mutual recognition. My critical engagement with the ambiguous assertions of Luce Irigaray seeks to demonstrate, on the one hand, that a woman needs to recognize her own identity but, on the other hand, that each subject whether male or female must struggle in relation to the other in order to maintain realism about life and death. No one can avoid the recognition that we are each given life but each of us also dies. In addition, I raise a more general, philosophical problem for analytic philosophers who attempt to read Continental philosophy of religion: how should philosophers interpret deliberately ambiguous assertions? For example, what does Irigaray mean in asserting, 'Divinity is what we need to become free, autonomous, sovereign'? To find an answer, I turn to the distinctively French readings of the Hegelian struggle for recognition which have preoccupied Continental philosophers especially since the first half of the last century. I explore the struggle for mutual recognition between women and men who must face the reality of life and death in order to avoid the projection of their fear of mortality onto the other sex. This includes a critical look at Irigaray's account of subjectivity and divinity. I turn to the French philosopher Michèle Le Doeuff in order to shift the focus from divinity to intersubjectivity. I conclude that taking seriously the struggle for mutual recognition between subjects forces contemporary philosophers of religion to be realist in their living and dying. With this in mind, the lesson from the Continent for philosophy of religion is that we must not stop yearning for recognition. Indeed, we must even risk our autonomy/divinity in seeking to recognize intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: La relación entre dos disciplinas del ámbito humanístico como son la historia y la literatura se ha dado tradicionalmente bajo la forma de la Historia literaria. El positivismo decimonónico imaginó un método por el que una obra literaria podía ser comprendida como un documento capaz de iluminar o ilustrar la naturaleza de un determinado periodo histórico. Hoy, una vez la historia literaria está ya en franco retroceso, podemos contemplar esa relación entre ambas desde una nueva perspectiva que abrieron tanto el debate historiográfico como la teoría y la crítica literaria. Vemos en ambas, aunque reconozcamos en ellas dos modalidades bien diferenciadas, una común naturaleza discursiva y unas mismas estrategias narrativas que las hermanan. Aquello que persiguen las dos, aunque una lo haga de forma directa y la otra de forma indirecta, es "representar" la realidad. Es decir, dotar de significado a la realidad. /// The relationship between History and Literature, both disciplines belonging to the humanistic field, has traditionally developed under the form of literary History. 19th century Positivism imagined a method by which a literary work could be understood as a document that could throw light upon the nature of a certain historical period or illustrate it. Now, when literary History is in clear decline, we can look at this relationship between both disciplines from a new perspective opened up both by historiographical debate and by literary criticism. In both we find, albeit under well differentiated modalities, a common discursive nature and the same narrative strategies. Even if one does so in a direct and the other in an indirect way, their common purpose is to "represent" reality, i.e., to give it a meaning.<br>

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i27823295<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Yiyu Liu<br>
Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

Author(s): Messick Brinkley<br>
Abstract: Muftis are literate scholars who specialise in Muslim legal-religious interpretation. They provide an example of a higher level of systematic indigenous interpretation than the common sense, everyday constructions of reality that have been discussed in anthropological accounts. I discuss the institutional form of the muftiship, and contrast it with the judgeship, with reference to indigenous ideal-types found in several categories of written Muslim social thought. This ideal form is then compared with the identities of historical and contemporary muftis in Yemen. The interpretive method employed by muftis joins a Greek-derived concept of analogy with recitation and hermeneutics. While their method is structurally similar to scriptural interpretation, muftis are worldly interpreters who address practical life problems posed by lay questioners.<br>

Publisher: Centre national de la recherche scientifique<br>
Issue: i30116051<br>
Date: 3 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Abstract: Clément Rosset explains that the word
cruor, from which crudelis (cruel) and crudus (indigestible) are derived,
designates torn and bloody flesh, that is, the thing itself stripped of all its orna-
ments and ordinary external accoutrements, in this case skin, and thus reduced to
its unique reality.... Thus reality is cruel - and indigestible - as soon as one re-
moves from it everything which is not reality in order to consider it in itself. (76)<br>

Article Title: Reader, Writer, and Holocaust Literature: The Case of Ka-Tzetnik<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i30245669<br>
Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Glasner-Heled Galia<br>
Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Article Title: Links across the Abyss: Language and Logic in International Relations<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i355724<br>
Date: 9 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Zehfuss K. M.<br>
Abstract: Constructivists have distanced themselves from questions of language in order to engage the "positivist" mainstream in dialogue. Yet language has played a central role in one important strand of positivism. Current debates in international relations assume a question about whether language is important. This article asks how or why language is important to the study of IR by exploring two distinct phases of the linguistic turn. The first phase, associated with logical positivism, approaches language as a picture of the logic of reality; the second, at the roots of a range of alternative approaches, approaches language use as analogous to making moves in a game. In constructing a link between two phases of the linguistic turn, the abyss separating "positivists," who aren't concerned with language, and "poststructuralists," who are, is replaced with a spectrum of different approaches to language and logic in international relations. The significance of these differences is illustrated in a variety of theoretical and empirical examples.<br>

Author(s): Lefort Dominique<br>
Abstract: Nous tentons de clarifier la place de la normativité dans une approche phénoménologique du politique en analysant l'opposition de la philosophie des droits de l'homme d'inspiration kantienne de Luc Ferry et Alain Renaut à la réflexion de type phénoménologique de Claude Lefort. Le projet de Lefort consiste d'abord en une tentative d'élucidation du réel et non de justification de principes. Mais la dimension normative n'en demeure pas absente puisque Lefort conçoit les droits de l'homme tant comme un phénomène du politique que comme signes de la liberté qu'il recherche dans la démocratie. Y a-t-il là nécessairement incohérence? /// Can a phenomenological analysis of political reality tackle the issue of norms? We try to answer this question through an analysis of the opposition between Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut's Kantian philosophy of human rights and the phenomenological approach of Claude Lefort. Lefort's project is an attempt to elucidate reality and not to justify principles. But the normative dimension is not entirely absent from his thought. Lefort conceives of human rights not only as a political phenomenon but also as a sign of liberty, which he supports. Is this inconsistent with the nature of his phenomenological project?<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first and third person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue into texts. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that focuses on reference, and results in "representing" dialogue. This obscures dialogue in the larger sense of constituting social reality. An indexical, rather than a referential approach to dialogue is developed through examination of indexing of social distance, discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications are traced out for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life.<br>

Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275777<br>
Date: 10 1, 1971<br>
Author(s): Weber Tracy B.<br>
Abstract: Most comparisons between Weber and Freud merely identify them as part of larger cultural syndromes. In this paper, I argue that they most resemble each other in the centrality they give to the notion of vocation or adulthood. For both, the man truly possessed of his vocation is the touchstone by which reality is both understood and transformed. They differ, however, in the structure they attribute to vocation. Weber sees it as requiring that humans accept their own historical sociology as constitutive of their selves; Freud asserts that (some) humans can escape from their pasts and only thus become full human beings. /// En générale, les comparaisons entre Freud et Weber se réduisent a l'affirmation qu'ils font tous les deux parti d'une même culture fin-de-siècle bourgeoise. Par contre, je soutiens ici qu'ils se ressemblent le plus dans la centralité qu'ils donnent chacun aux idées de la vocation et de l'adulte. Pour chacun, l'homme de vocation est la source de la comprehension de la réalité et de la transformation de la réalité. Ils diffèrent dans leur sens de la structure de la vocation. Pour Weber, l'homme de la vocation prends sur lui-même son passé et la sociologie de son histoire. Pour Freud, c'est plûtot une question d'echapper à son histoire, quelque chose que seulement certains pevent accomplir.<br>

Abstract: A social psychologist dissatisfied with the oversocialized conceptions of man which predominate in sociology may well seek in the psychoanalytic theory of the instincts a countervailing individuality and a hard core of human nature as a basis for resistance to social determinism and relativism. Nevertheless, man appears to be a "denatured" and symbolling, rather than an instinctual creature. The mechanistic and biologistic psychoanalytic metapsychology has obscured Freud's central discovery of the unconscious dimensions of man's reality-constructing activity. Intrapsychic conflict and man's resistance to socialization arise not from any clash between nature (instinct) and culture (civilization), but from contradictions between conscious and unconscious fantasies and among the varying projects and definitions related to different moments of a person's biography. While social psychologists need to be reminded of man's unconscious symbolic action and interaction, psychoanalysts must be recalled (perhaps by the followers of Mead, as well as by disciples of Lacan) to the essentially semiotic character of their enterprise. In both disciplines the task is hermeneutic more than ontological: our aim is less to reveal Reality than to describe our varying (personal and social) "realities" and their expression in the myths and metaphors we live by -- consciously, preconsciously and unconsciously. /// Un psychologue social insatisfait des conceptions sursocialisées de l'homme qui prédominent en sociologie peut très bien chercher dans la théorie psychanalytique des instincts une individualité compensatoire, un noyau dur de nature humaine comme base de résistance au déterminisme et relativisme social. Néanmoins, l'homme paraît un être "dénaturé" et vivant de symboles plutôt qu'un être d'instinct. La métapsychologie psychanalytique (mecaniste et "biologitique") a obscurci la découverte centrale de Freud de la dimension inconsciente de l'activité constructive du réel de l'homme. Les~<br>

Author(s): Deleuze Philippe<br>
Abstract: En janvier 1972, dans la France de Georges Pompidou, aux derniers feux de la "nouvelle société" promise depuis Matignon par Jacques Chaban-Delmas, "casseurs" et "gauchistes" sont déjà hors-jeu. Mais le "front des luttes" post-68 se déplace. Les prisonniers entrent en scène, à Toul en décembre 1971 puis à Nancy, ouvrant une mise en accusation de la justice dont le témoignage du docteur Vasseur en 2000 a bien montré que l'instruction n'était pas achevée. Les historiens entreprennent aujourd'hui, sur archives et témoignages, l'exploration de ce lancinant procès. Voici un des premiers exemples de leur travail, au ras des faits et des interprétations d'époque. Dans le sillage des luttes de l'après-68, des prisonniers de droit commun se mobilisèrent à partir de 1971. La mutinerie de Nancy en janvier 1972 fut réprimée mais suscita une mobilisation à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur des prisons françaises. L'auteur l'analyse notamment à partir des archives du Groupe d'information sur les prisons (GIP), mais aussi de la presse et de diverses enquêtes. Le GIP, où militaient aussi des intellectuels de renom, prit ainsi une part importante dans la mise à jour de la réalité carcérale, à l'occasion de ce qui fut le premier grand procès de la prison. /// In the wake of the post-1968 struggles, common law prisoners started mobilizing as of 1971. The Nancy mutiny in January 1972 was repressed, but it brought about mobilization inside and outside French prisons. The author analyzes this from the records of the Prison Information Group (GIP) but also from those of the press and various investigations. The GIP, in which famous intellectuals actively participated, had a big role in showing prison reality clearly in what was the first big prison trial.<br>

Abstract: Drawing on two studies of children aged between seven and 10 years this article explores their narratives of themselves, families, sibling and peer relationships. Their narratives were full of push-pull and contradictory processes. The children moved towards knowledge as well as a disavowal of 'reality' about their families and material conditions. Critically they revealed profound wishes for something better alongside the knowledge that 'this is it'. This article focuses on theorizing children's understandings of and relationships to social and material life in order to argue that meanings matter and meanings have matter. Narratives are social in two critical ways: they involve reaching out and connecting with others, and narratives are constructed within and through the social sphere, while simultaneously they are shot through with conscious and unconscious fantasies. Children are moving towards being in a complex - engaged in and inhabiting many relationships.<br>

Abstract: El cambio social, ¿es realizado por actores/agentes (=sujetos, individuales y supraindividuales), o bien por determinismos colectivos (como estructuras y sistemas)?, ¿o tal vez por una combinación cualquiera entre actores y mecanismos sociales? Las teorías sociológicas, desde el Ochocientos hasta hoy, se han dividido en dos grandes campos: a) Por un lado, han habido teorías que han adoptado un "paradigma olístico". b) Por otro, han emergido teorías que, juzgando las primeras como infectadas de determinismo, han elaborado un "paradigma accionista". Muchos autores han mezclado o combinado juntos ora una, ora otra de estas posturas sin lograr encontrar un punto de vista capaz de integrarlas o trascenderlas. El resultado es que, hoy, la mayor parte de las teorías oscilan entre el primer y el segundo paradigma, o bien tratan de comprender el cambio social a través de mezclas o "fórmulas combinatorias" entre las dos. La tesis del autor es que ni las teorías sistémicas (olísticas) ni las accionísticas (individualistas) ni sus combinaciones pueden encontrar una "comprensión adecuada" del cambio social. Ofrecen visiones parciales de la historia, que son insuficientes en tanto que comparten una carencia común: la idea de que la relación social sea un resultado (un efecto) de "otras" variables en juego, como las estructuras sociales o --por el contrario-- la subjetividad individual, o bien un determinismo en sí misma. Para comprender el cambio social se precisa de una teoría adecuada al carácter relacional de la realidad social, como realidad sui generis "hecha de" relaciones sociales. Se propone aquí un paradigma, denominado "relacional", según el cual el cambio social consiste en la "emergencia" de realidades sociales movidas por sujetos (individuales y colectivos) queestán en relación entre ellos en un determinado sentido. "Comprender" signifìca "relacionarse" con todo lo que tal relación (¡social!) significa y comporta. En la parte final se trata de ejemplificar las potenc~<br>

Abstract: Reinhart Koselleck outlined a model of historical time in various essays most of them collected in the anthologies "Zeitschichten" and "Vergangene Zukunft". The article tries to reconstruct Koselleck's transcendental principals of history. It questions Koselleck's understanding of natural time and anthropological categories. According to Hans Georg Gadamer's criticism of Koselleck, the article argues that even Koselleck's anthropological categories are always already determined by culture and history. Historical time and historical truth are constructed by historical narrations. This conviction does not imply, however, the denial of historical reality. The author suggests combining Koselleck's categories "Erfahrungsraum" and "Erwartungshorizont" with a narratological point of view.<br>

Abstract: La réanimation et les techniques employées ont bousculé notre rapport à la mort, déjà professionnalisée et médicalisée. L'étude de quatre services de réanimation, en France et en Grande-Bretagne, permet de faire apparaître la réalité des pratiques concrètes de la mort et de la replacer au cœur des relations professionnelles et des expériences personnelles. Au terme de ce travail, la décision de fin de vie apparaît être une véritable construction sociale : loin d'être purement objective et médicale, elle est conditionnée par des effets de contexte et par l'engagement des acteurs. La recherche d'autonomie et d'autorégulation professionnelle renforce l'ambivalence du processus de "mourir" déjà complexe puisque régi par des logiques très hétérogènes. La mort dépend plus de l'organisation et de la culture de chaque service que de la volonté du patient ou de ses proches. /// Intensive care units and their techniques have considerably altered our attitude towards death as well as the death process - a process that had already been professionalised and medicalised. This study of four intensive care units in France and Britain brings to light the reality of deathrelated practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relationships and personal experiences. Study results strongly suggest that the decision to end life is a genuine social construction : far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by numerous and heterogeneous logics. This study shows that our death depends more on the organization and the culture of the intensive care unit than on our own wishes or those of close relatives. /// Behandlung und technische Mittel in der Intensivstation haben unser Verhaltnis zum Sterben grundlegend verändert und es heute schon zu einer medizinischen Berufssache g~<br>

Author(s): Lara Gabriela<br>
Abstract: The article explores the social meaning of the songs written and performed during the revolutionary Democratic Kampuchea period in Cambodia (1975-1979), hoping thereby to better understand the ideology of the Khmer Rouge as it relates to aesthetic and the degree to which such an aesthetic may be related to the abuses of power associated with the period. The article summarizes what is known about how the songs were generated and used: on radio broadcasts, at political meeting, and as part of revolutionary theater. It discusses the social implications of the ways the songs were used in meetings and at work sites, and the power generated by the fact that the songs were used to the exclusion of earlier kinds of songs. Finally, the article analyzes three songs found in Khmer Rouge song books, in terms of the attitudes expressed toward nature, labor, youth, and the relationship of the sexes. It explores the idea of irony, and how the "meaning" of the songs may have been tinged with greater and greater irony in relation to the changing reality of the Cambodian revolution.<br>

Author(s): Morujão Alexandre Fradique<br>
Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Author(s): Genís Octavi Fullat<br>
Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Author(s): Costa Miguel Dias<br>
Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique. On prend comme point de départ les présupposés phénoménologiques et ontologiques de sa philosophie, pour aborder successivement les questions concernant l'interprétation textuelle, l'imagination et la créativité, l'action, le temps et le récit, l'idéologie et l'utopie. Tout en reconnaissant un certain logocentrisme–un mélange de Logos et de réalité supposée–impliqué dans la solution de ces questions qui nous est proposée par l'auteur, on cherche à repenser le lieu entre le sens et le consensus, la cohérence et la question même de la violence. A cet effet, la derniére section établit une confrontation entre les positions défendues par Ricoeur et l'hypothèse de R.

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis. The approach this article takes, however, is to begin by treating a prior problematic~<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies.

Abstract: A obra principal de Bernard Lonergan Inteligência: Um ensaio sobre o conhecimento humano, é um tratado que leva a cabo uma integração segundo o método transcendental dos conhecimentos heterogéneos da ciência, da filosofia, do senso comum e da teologia. A obra visa a auto-apropriação da nossa auto-consciência intelectual e racional com base na experiência consciente dos actos de intelecção. Começa como teoria cognitiva, expande-se para uma metafísica e uma ética, e avança para uma concepção e uma afirmação de Deus, para ser finalmente confrontada com o problema do mal que exige a transformação da inteligência auto-confiante no intellectus quaerens fidem. Ao cumprir estes objectivos, Inteligência tornou-se uma das mais importantes obras de filosofia do século XX, aqui sucintamente elucidada em cinco das suas principais vertentes: a relação entre conhecimento e realidade, conhecimento científico e cosmologia, a acção humana e a ética, as questões de interpretação, a relação entre natureza de Deus e filosofia. O artigo conclui com uma avaliação da cosmopolis lonerganiana, ou seja, o poder da comunidade de espírito na sociedade. /// Bernard Lonergan s opus magnum, Insight: A Study of human understanding, handles the heterogeneous fields of knowledge as given in science, philosophy, common sense and theology according to a transcendental method. The work aims at the self-appropriation of human intellectual and rational self-conscience as based in the conscious experience of insight. Lonergan s work starts as a cognitive theory, and advances, through metaphysics and ethics, to a conception and affirmation of God, one that is confronted with the problem of evil and therefore requires a transformation of self-confident intelligence into the intellectus quaerens fidem. Handling these goals, Insight became one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20 th century. The present article deals with five of the main issues in Lonergan s work: the relation between knowledge~<br>

Abstract: La literatura contemporánea asume una función que, en esencia, tiene un fundamento de índole religiosa: revela sentidos en el mundo, creando vínculos entre el receptor y su propia realidad. Esta función la lleva a cabo por medio de mecanismos del lenguaje metafórico, en procesos de desmitologización y mitificación discursivas. La literatura hispanoamericana relaciona esta función del lenguaje estético con el tema de la identidad cultural. La poética del dramaturgo mexicano Rodolfo Usigli expresa esta concepción del arte de modo ejemplar. Sobre la base de los conceptos anteriores, se analizará e interpretará la elaboración de imágenes metefóricas de la identidad hispanoamericana en las obras Corona de luz, de Rodolfo Usigli; Todos los gatos son pardos, de Carlos Fuentes; y Lautaro, de Isidora Aguirre. /// Contemporary literature has assumed a function which in essence, possesses a religious grounding: it releases meaning by creating links betiveen the received and his/her ozvn reality. This function is carried out by mechanism of metaphorical language in processes of discursive demythologizing as xuell as myth making. Spanish American literary unitingrelates this function of aesthetic language to the major theme of cultural identity. The poetics of the Mexican dramatist Rodolfo Usigli expresses this conception of art in an exemplary way. On the basis of the above concepts, this article analyzes and interprets the elaboration of metaphorical images in R. Usigli's "Corona de luz", Carlos Fuentes's "Todos los gatos son pardos" and Isidora Aguirre's "Lautaro".<br>

Author(s): Murray Paul E.<br>
Abstract: Accounts of intergroup conflict are symbolic constructions that are meaningful to informants in communicational contexts. Their use in comparative methodologies usually overlooks their meaningfulness to subjects in favor of some other level of reality, e. g., ecological, which is presumed to be more basic. The author argues that the social and cultural contextualizing of such data is logically prior to other analytical approaches and he illustrates his interpretive method by examining a "traditional," Eskimo (Takamiut) account of an Eskimo victory over Naskapi Indians as emergent from a particular socio-cultural context.<br>

Abstract: The intention of the article is to demonstrate the dialectical relation of self-understanding and understanding of the Other within ethnological interpretation. Proceeding from the conflict between the estimation of the reality of the Chachilla-Indians (formerly called Cayapa) on the part of a protestant missionary and the ethnologist, the whole ethnological enterprise turns out not to aim at "structures," "actions," or other "objects" but at the multiple forms of understanding with which it is confronted and of which itself is a part. Because of this hermeneutical orientation ethnological knowledge necessarily remains open for corrections and reinterpretations.<br>

Abstract: Depuis la seconde moitié du xxe siècle, il s'opère un jeu de va-et-vient incessant entre le passé et le présent, entre la transcendance de la tradition ou sa rupture, en même temps qu'il se produit un phénomène d'échanges et de communications de diverses musiques du monde. De ce phénomène résultent aussi bien des chocs de culture, de savoirs que de pensées et de leur ré-interprétation ou transformation, sans oublier leur ré-appropriation par les uns et par les autres. Les musiques des uns et des autres -cultures du monde -, devenant alors le patrimoine de tous, se prêtent aux fantasmes et aux interprétations de ceux qui les reçoivent ou les perçoivent selon leur sensibilité, selon leurs affinités. C'est dans ce cadre que la musique elitiste contemporaine couvre actuellement une hétérogénéité de procédés et de formes, en ce qu'elle associe divers facteurs : écriture-oralité, mémoire collective, acquis culturel, juxtaposition ou enchevêtrement d'expressions musicales d'origines diverses (populaires, variétés, traditionnelles, savantes). Ceci appelle sa relecture à différents niveaux, par conséquent sa ré-interprétation, ainsi que l'examen approfondi de ses conditions historiques et socioculturelles de production. Pour amorcer cette nouvelle réflexion sur l'art musical elitiste contemporain, devenue actuellement plus qu'une nécessité, je propose l'expression World Music savante pour servir ici de béquille à une tentative de questionnement sur l'émergence et la consolidation d'une nouvelle identité culturelle ou tradition musicale elitiste contemporaine, celle cristallisant une réalité multiple et hétérogène. C'est aussi, pour moi, une manière de m'interroger sur la contemporanéité de la musique savante actuelle. Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been a ceaseless interplay between past and present, between transcendence of and break with tradition, together with a phenomenon of exchange and communication with diverse musics of the world, resulting in ~<br>

Abstract: Ambient Intelligence is a vision of a future in which autonomie smart environments take an unprecedented number of decisions both for the private and the public good. It involves a shift to automated pattern recognition, a new paradigm in the construction of knowledge. This will fundamentally affect our lives, increasing specific types of errors, loss of autonomy and privacy, unfair discrimination and stigmatisation, and an absence of due process. Current law's articulation in the technology of the printed script is inadequate in the face of the new type of knowledge generation. A possible solution is to articulate legal protections within the socio-technical infrastructure. In particular, both privacy-enhancing and transparency-enhancing technologies must be developed that embed legal rules in ambient technologies themselves. This vision of Ambient Law' requires a novel approach to law making which addresses the challenges of technology, legitimacy, and political-legal theory. Only a constructive and collaborative effort to migrate law from books to other technologies can ensure that Ambient Law becomes reality, safeguarding the fundamental values underlying privacy, identity, and democracy in tomorrows ambient intelligent world.<br>

Abstract: Nous nous proposons ici de réfléchir à la question suivante : Comment expliquer le fait que les fondateurs du « programme fort », Barry Bames et David Bloor, insistent depuis quelques années pour dire qu'ils n'ont jamais nié l'influence de la « réalité » sur la formation des connaissances scientifiques et qu'en fait ils ont été mal compris de leurs lecteurs ? Alors que Bloor tente d'expliquer les malentendus en les situant complètement du côté du récepteur, en invoquant une loi psychologique dite de « conventionalisation » proposée par Frederic Charles Bartlett, nous voulons esquisser ici une explication complémentaire qui se situe du côté de l'émetteur et prend au sérieux la structure argumentaire des textes. We propose in this paper to answer the following question : How can we explain the fact that the founders of the « Strong Program », Barry Bames and David Bloor, insisted, over the last couple of years, to say that they have never denied the role played by « reality » in the construction of scientific knowledge, and thus have been misunderstood by their readers ? Whereas Bloor explains these misunderstandings by invoking a psychological law of « conventionalization » due to Frederic Charles Bartlett, thus locating the source of the problem on the receiver's (reader's) side, we suggest here a complementary explanation taking into account the argumentative structure of the text itself, hence situating the origin of the confusion on the writer's side.<br>

Abstract: The article explores the social meaning of songs written and performed during the revolutionary Democratic Kampuchea period in Cambodia (1975-79). After discussing how songs were generated and used, and the social implications they projected in meetings and at work sites, the article analyzes three songs and their attitudes toward nature, labor, youth, and relationships between the sexes. The idea of irony, and how the songs may have taken on increasing irony in the context of the harsh reality of the Cambodian revolution, is explored.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: What emerges as the overarching theme in the extensive work of the Dutch philosopher Cornelis Verhoeven (1928-2001) is our relationship to reality. Being appealed to by thousands of things in our existence makes us realize that we cannot avoid reality. The most meaningful forms of reality are symbols, which lead us, through radical astonishment and contemplation to the metaphysical insight that something exists rather than nothing. This renders Verhoeven sceptical as the weakness of our ability to know and understand hampers our vision of hard reality, and also ironical because so many forms of speaking and writing display a reality which is being taken for granted. Thinking symbolically, metaphysical reflection and scepsis towards thoughdess assumptions are the instruments of a contemplation which, in Verhoeven's work, leave room for the lyrical prevalence of reality. In his later writings he gradually and more insistently draws attention to the theme of truth, while at the same time not denying our epistemological incapacity towards understanding and explaining reality.<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: Différence, référence, communicabilité : trois mots-clés pour dessiner la structure originaire et élémentaire de la signifiance. Or, l'interrogation change de nature quand on la déplace du signifié vers le sens, puis vers la signifiance. Il ne s'agit ni d'une action, ni d'un événement, mais d'un processus. Trois conditions nécessaires : présence d'un matériel signifiant (sonore, graphique, électronique) ; aptitude à se référer à une réalité extérieure ; énonciateurs en relation binaire entre lesquels et pour lesquels les énoncés signifient. L'auteur examine les conséquences de leur considération groupée en philosophie du langage. Difference, reference and communicability are three key-words to outline the original and elementary structure of« signifying ». Now, the nature of philosophical interrogation changes when it shifts from the saussurian « signifié » towards the meaning, a fortiori towards signifying. It is neither an action nor an event but a process. Three conditions are necessary : the presence of specific material (whether acoustic, graphic or electronical) ; an aptitude to refer to an outside reality ; speakers standing in binary relationship. The writer examines the consequences of considering the constraints as gathered in a philosophy of language.<br>

Abstract: Le défi du groupe Luciole consiste à montrer l'intérêt heuristique d'une observation de la matérialité des formes symboliques. La campagne présidentielle 1988 par voie d'affiches, a servi de corpus. Nous avons ainsi décrit ces affiches comme des matériaux mixtes, complexes et hétérogènes : description des opérations cognitives, symboliques, interactives et intertextuelles qui permettent la construction et la co-construction des significations matérialisées dans l'affiche. Les résultats obtenus sont cumulables avec deux conceptualisations différentes : servir d'étalon pour mesurer la « réalité sociale » (l'émission et/ou la réception) ; ou attribuer au « sens » la valeur de condition de possibilité de la réalité sociale. The challenge take up by the LUCIOLE group is to demonstrate the heuristic interest of the observation of the materiality of symbolic forms. The posters of the French presidential election campaign of 1988 provided us with our study corpus. We have described these posters as mixed materials of a complex and heterogeneous nature. We describe the cognitive, symbolic, interactive and inter textual operations which allow for the construction and co-construction of the significations materialised in the posters. The results obtained may be added to those of two different conceptualisations. They may serve as benchmarks to measure « social reality » (its emission and/or reception) or, alternatively, give the « sense » of the poster a value as a condition for a possible social reality.<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires.

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to show that so-called conventional metaphors play a twofold role in discourse. We distinguish two sub-groups of so-called conventional metaphors (semi-denatured and denatured metaphors) depending on whether or not we still perceive the conceptual contrast generated when the conventional metaphor was a genuine metaphor. On the one hand, the choice of some sample of denatured conventional metaphor reflects the same about our ideology as what the choice of a literally used expression does, the original conceptual contrast is not retrievable. On the other hand, the use of a semi-denatured metaphor exploits the recognition of an ideological change, its use reflects the consolidation of the conceptual restructuring that took place when it was a metaphor. Semi-denatured metaphors show how reality and ideology have been in part constructed by the metaphorical use of language.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and other social sciences are influenced by constructivism when they connect the transformation of static and traditional societies into modern and dynamic ones predominantly with the division of labour (Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Pareto, American pragmatic sociology etc.) The social constructivism of Schutz, Berger, Luckmann and Goffman directed the focus of sociology to the intentional structuring of everyday social reality (taken for granted) by mutual communication and individual activities. Our survey of social constructivism continues with the theories of semiotic construction of reality: Garfinkel's studies of indexical expressions, Habermas' theory of argumentative rationality and Ricoeur's hermeneutics. The author finally offers his own theory on the social construction of reality by parallel institutionalisation and narrativization. The central puzzle of this theory is how to cope with extreme situations, crisis and transitions.<br>

Author(s): Meschkank Julia<br>
Abstract: The paper seeks to contribute to the recent slum tourism-debate. On the basis of an empirical field study conducted in Mumbai in 2009, this article investigates how Indian slums are observed by different actors within the communication context of this (emerging) form of tourism. Taking into consideration that slums are defined in public discourse nearly exclusively by poverty and sordidness, it is interesting to examine how the tour agency's objective of correcting the negative connotations of poverty is achieved. Accordingly, the study aims, by means of a second order observation, to observe how the tourists and the tour agency simultaneously perceive and charge poverty. Following the epistemological premise that reality is an observer-dependent construction, it seeks to outline which different images or realities of the investigated slum, Dharavi, are created by the different observations. The findings will then facilitate a discussion of the extent to which poverty can be defined as the dominant mode of observation of the slum tourism context as a whole.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Abstract: Dans cet article, nous évoquerons la question des témoignages de la Shoah et des circonstances de leur énonciation. A cet effet, nous décrirons cet objet sociodiscursif particulier qu'est le témoignage, en détaillant ses composantes définitoires (certification autobiographique, pacte de référentialité, portée collective, etc.), en réfléchissant sur les conditions de son accréditation et en le comparant aux autres modalités et stratégies discursives (discours de l'historien, récit littéraire, etc.) utilisées pour transmettre cette réalité extrême et non partagée de la déportation et de l'expérience concentrationnaire. In this paper, I focus on the question of the testimonies of the Shoah and the circumstances of their creation. The testimony, a specific sociodiscursive object, is described by detailling its defining elements (autobiographical certification, referentiality pact, collective thrust, etc.), by reflecting on the conditions of its accreditation and by comparing it to the other discursive modalities and strategies (the discourse of the historian, literary accounts, etc.) used to convey the extreme and unshared reality of deportation and the experience of concentration camps.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'intéresse aux Béni-Boudouane, population qui fut le vivier du recrutement des harkis du bachaga Boualem pendant la guerre d'indépendance. À partir d'archives coloniales et d'une enquête ethnographique au Mas Thibert, en Provence, où ils se sont installés à l'indépendance, il s'agit d'interroger la nature, l'ampleur et la forme des contacts coloniaux dans une région d'où les Français étaient physiquement absents. La colonisation s'y manifesta essentiellement par la formalisation de l'existence des Béni-Boudouane en tant que tribu et par l'application restreinte des lois forestières les dépossédant. Les Béni-Boudouanais vécurent à l'écart de l'Algérie des Français, dont l'irruption fut tardive, au moment de la guerre. Jusque-là, les quelques auxiliaires locaux de l'administration française étaient l'incarnation de l'Algérie coloniale, perçue toutefois par la mémoire collective comme une réalité quotidienne et normalisée. This article deals with the Beni-Boudouane, a population which formed the breeding ground for the recruitment of bachaga Boualems harkis during the Algerian war for independence. Through archival and ethnographic research in Mas Thibert, Provence, where this population settled after independence, this study tries to understand the nature, importance and form of colonial contacts in a region where the French were physically absent. There colonization appeared through the formalization of the Beni-Boudouane s existence as a tribe and through the application of forest laws which served to deprive the population of property. The Beni-Boudouane lived apart from French Algeria until the war. Until then, a few local auxiliaries of the French administration embodied colonial Algeria. In collective memory, this government was perceived as an everyday, normalized reality.<br>

Author(s): Spencer Alexander<br>
Abstract: Dieser Artikel möchte eine konstruktivistische Herangehensweise zur Erforschung des Terrorismus illustrieren. Er will zeigen, wie bestimmte metaphorische Konstruktionen des »Terroristen« in den Medien bestimmte Gegenmaβnahmen ermöglichen. Basierend auf Ansätzen aus der kognitiven Linguistik führt der Beitrag eine Metaphernanalyse von Artikeln der Bild-Zeitung durch und arbeitet fünf verschiedene konzeptionelle Verständnisseheraus: »TERRORISMUS IST KRIEG«; »TERRORISMUS IST VERBRECHEN«; »TERRORISMUS IST UNZIVILISIERT UND BÖSE«; »TERRORISMUS IST EIN NATUREREIGNIS« und »TERRORISMUS IST KRANKHEIT«. Hierbei zeigt der Artikel, dass Metaphern nicht nur Realität beschreiben, sondern aktiv teilnehmen an der Konstruktion der Welt, wie wir sie sehen, über sie denken und letztendlich auf sie reagieren. Indem Metaphern Verständnisse von einem konzeptuellen Bereich wie Krieg auf andere Bereiche wie Terrorismus übertragen, lassen sie bestimmte Gegenmaβnahmen angemessen erscheinen, während sie andere Möglichkeiten der Entgegnung von vorneherein ausschlieβen. This article wants to illustrate a constructivist approach to the analysis of terrorism. It wants to show how particular metaphorical constructions of the »terrorist« in the media make certain counter-measures possible. Based on approaches in cognitive linguistics the article conducts a metaphor analysis of the Bild newspaper and illustrates five different conceptual understandings: Terrorism Is War; Terrorism Is Crime; Terrorism Is Uncivilised Evil; Terrorism Is Natural and Terrorism Is Disease. Thereby the article shows that metaphors do not only describe reality but they actively take part in the construction of the world as we see it, think of it and ultimately react to it. By projecting understandings from one conceptual area such as war to a different area such as terrorism, metaphors make certain counter measures appear appropriate while other means are placed outside of the options considered sensible.<br>

Abstract: El autor reflexiona sobre la evolución de la historia del discurso en Francia y su aproximación a la historia semántica, inspirada en la obra de Koselleck, y a la historia del discurso de tradición anglosajona. Tras repasar los antecedentes de la actual historia del discurso francesa desde los años setenta y evaluar la influencia de la obra de Foucault en esta disciplina, el autor aborda, a la luz de los últimos trabajos de Quentin Skinner, la cuestión de la intencionalidad individual y colectiva de los textos históricos, es decir, los mecanismos que constituyen y explican, en palabras de Koselleck, «la conexión empírica entre la realidad y el discurso». The author thinks about the evolution of the history of discourse in France and its approach to semantic history as inspired by the work of Koselleck, and also to the history of discourse in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. After revising the precedents of the current French history of speech from the 70s and evaluating the influence of the work of Foucault in this discipline, the author approaches, in the light of Quentin Skinner's last works, the question of the individual and collective premeditation of historical texts, that is to say, the mechanisms that constitute and explain, in words of Koselleck, «the empirical connection between reality and discourse».<br>

Abstract: Clifford Geertz's influential definition of religions as providing their members with both an ethos and a worldview-in his terms, both a "model for" and "model of" reality-has of late become a neuralgic point of contention in religious studies. In particular some critics have seen his ideas of religious models of reality as biased, out-moded, or in other ways confused about the way that language refers (or does not refer) to the world. In this article, I consider two criticisms of Geertz's project and seek to show that, despite the partial value of the criticisms, the idea of religious models of reality continues to be a legitimate and fruitful approach to what religious communities are typically up to.<br>

Abstract: To refer to reality in literature has often been incorrectly understood as the fact that the author designates elements of the real world of his time, term for term as it were and as if everyone would agree on what constitutes "the real world of his time"; from this point of view, an author such as Proust is cut off from reality... This is to miss the degree to which Proust's practice of language asks the relevant questions about reference as it tries to refer to reality, namely the phenomenological question of the way we dynamically construct at least the reality we perceive.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Author(s): ZipesAbstract: This essay considers a group of novels from the 1960s and 1970s about African-American revolution, by Barry Beckham, Nivi-kofi A. Easley, Sam Greenlee, Chester Himes, Blyden Jackson, William Melvin Kelley, John O. Killens, Warren Miller, Julian Moreau, Chuck Stone, John Edgar Wideman, and John A. Williams as examples of black power sf. It focuses in particular on their inability to imagine a post-revolutionary future, and the strategies they adopt in place of more conventional sf techniques of extrapolation-such as refusal, immanentization, veil-rending, and pornotopianism-in order to narrativize the problem of what Walter Mosley has characterized as breaking the chains of (white) reality.<br>

Abstract: The policy literature has long recognized the inherent need for a program to fit the unique conditions found in a certain context. We present a theory of institutional contextualism that focuses on the mechanisms by which actors adapt a policy design to fit a situation. We conceptualize institutions as phenomena that are constituted by a constant dialectic between text (the general blueprint) and context (the particular setting). The first half of this dialectic, which is the diffusion of the constitutive text or norm onto the institutional setting, has been discussed in the literature. Our research focuses on the second half, and we delineate, in concept, mechanisms for fitting the program to the local context. We then use a case study of improvised microfinance programs in Tamil Nadu, India, to illustrate how this occurs in reality. The research underscores the unexamined link between effective governance and contextual fit and offers a typology of mechanisms for fit that should inform future research.<br>

Abstract: The study ’The meaning of action, the action of meaning’ raises the theoretical question of the relationship between the intent and meaning, the self-referentiality and referentiality of the literary text. It sets out from the hypothesis that a literary text has not only a self-referential, but also a referential character. Unlike non-literary texts whose function is their intent, the referentiality of a literary text is open. The ambiguity and polysemy of the text then results from the non-obviousness of reality itself. The concept that captures this difference between literary texts and texts with other functions is that of meaning. The study uses the concrete example of the thematicisation of the metamorphosis of a puppet, a monster or an animal into a man in Kleist, Collodi and Grass to illustrate the difference between mechanical intent founded upon efficiency and living meaning, founded on ambiguity and non-functional complexity. An analysis of Pavel Vilikovský’s novel Kôn na poschodí, slepec vo Vrábroch (’Horse Upstairs, Blind Man in Vráble’) shows how, in its thematic, ostentatiously self-referential action, meaning is born as an expression of the polysemic re fe re n tia lity of the text. The analy sis shows that behind this self-referentiality the text is also created in the referential action of meaning to such an extent that it is precisely the open action of meaning which becomes the r » on-obvious sense of the action of the text.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113394<br>
Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Bishop Edward L.<br>
Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Article Title: The Semiotics of Fictional Time: Three Metaphors in the Study of Temporality in Fiction<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113403<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ronen Ruth<br>
Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Article Title: Literal Metaphors: On Reading Postmodernism<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113423<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): van Alphen Ernst<br>
Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le célèbre article de Merleau-Ponty, « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », la manière dont on évalue le rapport entre ces deux auteurs détermine ou exprime autant d'interprétations historiques du structuralisme et de choix théoriques ou philosophiques quant aux sciences sociales. Cette filiation se voulait une critique: être fidèle à la découverte de Mauss, celle du caractère central de la réciprocité dans la vie sociale, imposait de dépasser la sociologie vers une sémiologie générale. Cet article s'efforce de montrer qu'il ne s'agit pas là, contrairement à l'interprétation subtile qu'en fit Merleau-Ponty, défaire de la réalité sociale un système de points de vue substituables ou de mouvements córreles de subjectivation, mais de montrer que ce sont les « valeurs » qui, du fait de leur nature, de leur ontologie, doivent nécessairement circuler entre plusieurs points de vue exclusifs et complémentaires. Il revisite la célèbre critique de Lévi-Strauss à Mauss sur l'explication de l'obligation de donner par une « force des choses », et replace l'apport de l'anthropologie structurale dans la philosophie de l'esprit contemporaine, là où elle se confronte aux questions ouvertes par la physique sur l'ontologie des objets quantiques. Since Merleau-Ponty's famous paper « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », the way the link between these two authors has been construed determine or reveal as many historical interpretations of structuralism as philosophical and theoretical choices about social sciences. We know that this vindicated kinship was supposed to be critical: being faithful to Mauss's discovery, that of the centrality of reciprocity in social life, compelled us to overcome sociology in the direction of a general semiology. This paper, in opposition at Merleau-Ponty's subtle interpretation of this move, tries to show that it was not aimed at a redefinition of social reality as a system of substitutablepoints of view and correlated movements of subjectivation, but at t~<br>

Abstract: La pensée de W. Dilthey est ici interrogée dans la perspective de sa contribution au dégagement des éléments principaux d'un concept historique de temps. Dans le contexte de son projet de fondation des sciences de l'esprit, Dilthey tente de reconquérir la réalité du temps — contre son idéalisation transcendantale — en le reconduisant à son origine dans la vie psychique. Mais ce foyer psychologique de la conception diltheyenne du temps lui barre l'accès à un concept de temps véritablement adapté à l'histoire. En envisageant le temps et l'histoire dans la perspective du présent et sur la base d'une anthropologie encore tributaire de la tradition moderne, Dilthey indique ainsi a contrario de possibles voies pour parvenir à un véritable concept historique de temps. This paper will examine Dilthey's contribution to defining the main elements of a historical concept of time. In the framework of his attempt to lay the philosophical foundations of the human sciences, Dilthey aims to reclaim the reality of time against its transcendental idealization by returning it to its origins in psychic life. However, the psychological focus of the Diltheyian conception of time prevents it from accessing a time concept properly suited to history. On the other hand, by approaching time from the perspective of the present and on the basis of modern anthropology, Dilthey indicates possible pathways for achieving a proper historical concept of time.<br>

Abstract: Metaphors cannot be studied in abstracto. The use of metaphors is part of the communication process of John's Gospel. Therefore this study starts with a consideration of the Gospel as a communicative act. This means that the author(s) employ(s) various means to alter the listeners'/readers' world view. Perhaps the most important way of achieving this is through the use of metaphors. Metaphors are created by way of unexpected predication through a deliberate category mistake. In this way the possibility is opened to innovative perception (seeing what was not there to see before) as well as to a redescription of reality. By relating the metaphors used in John's Gospel (e g true light, good shepherd, true vine, etc) to their possible communication situation, one can gain insight into the role metaphors play in identifying the Jesus of John.<br>

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Abstract: Objectivistic philosophy and reductionist theories have contributed to a malaise in society and the church. On the one hand, the fruits of modernity and deconstructive postmodernism have led to a situtation where the observable and the empirical are considered the true index of reality. There is a loss of purpose and meaning in life. The church finds itself in a situation of crisis, and needs to admit its own shortcomings in order to be a leaven for society. At the same time, there is an 'outbreak' of interest in issues of spirituality and mysticism throughout the world as the end of the millennium draws near. Mysticism, particularly scriptural mysticism, is an ecclesial charism, and when understood and appropriated can be a source of renewal for the church and society.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes some guidelines for relevant Indian interpretations of the Bible. It examines the traditional Western methods and perspectives as well as the challenges to these methods in Biblical hermeneutics in India. Shifting trends in Western methods of biblical interpretation and their inability to meet the needs of the context could give the motivation to develop methods and principles for authentic Indian biblical interpretations. Drawing on insights from the biblical interpretation in Latin America, Asia and South Africa, Indian Biblical hermeneutics must move towards discovering critical tools that are helpful in the Indian context. Such an endeavour needs to take seriously both the inner and the outer reality of India and develop a proper perspective for Indian Biblical interpretations. Judicious use of the critical tools and resources available in the context, commitment to the poor and the oppressed and faith-response to God are imperative for evolving effective Indian biblical interpretations. The complex Indian context demands a plurality of critical biblical readings with the people in pluri-religious community, open to the dynamic activity of the Spirit with a goal to transform our society and promote communal harmony.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i396847<br>
Date: 10 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): MellonAbstract: This article considers some methodological issues that arise when empirical inquiry is conducted within the framework of qualitative assumptions about the nature of reality and how we as humans can know it. These assumptions posit an empirical reality that is complex, intertwined, best understood as a contextual whole, and inseparable from the individuals-including the researchers--who know that reality. Four primary issues are considered in this article: the researcher as interpreter; the emergent nature of qualitative research; understanding the experience of others; and trustworthiness in qualitative research. Further, the article discusses methodological practices that have arisen in the context of qualitative assumptions and issues. The practices described are drawn from diverse qualitative research traditions, including participant observation, naturalistic inquiry, grounded theory, hermeneutic approaches to the interpretation of texts (and actions as texts), qualitative evaluation, and a body of methodological literature that calls itself generically "qualitative research." The goals of the article are threefold: (1) to present the internal rationale of qualitative research as issues and practices that arise within the context of assumptions about reality and what we can know about it; (2) to encourage researchers to examine the relevance of qualitative assumptions, issues, and practices to their own research problems; and (3) to point readers toward more detailed discussions of qualitative research.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: Cet article prend appui sur une enquête ethnographique de longue durée au sein d'un syndicat local de cheminots CFDT. Il s'inscrit dans une problématique constructiviste, envisageant la réalité sociale comme une construction historique et quotidienne des acteurs sociaux. Il tente plus précisément, dans ce cadre et à partir de matériaux empiriques, de réévaluer, à propos de l'univers syndical, les rapports entre connaissance savante et connaissance ordinaire ; d'où la notion d'epistemologie ordinaire du syndicalisme qui prend pour objet tout à la fois les sociologies des chercheurs professionnels et les sociologies mises en œuvre quotidiennement par les acteurs syndicaux. Il se démarque alors tant de la tradition de la rupture épistémologique entre travail scientifique et savoirs ordinaires que de la tendance à l'indifférenciation des pratiques savantes et ordinaires propre à l'ethnométhodologie. This article is based on a long range ethnographie survey within a CFDT local railway workers' union. It follows a constructivist problematics line, considering social reality as a daily and historical construction by social actors. More precisely, it attempts, within this framework and starting from empirical material, to reassess, in the trade union universe, the relation between scholarly and ordinary knowledge, which leads to the concept of an ordinary epistemology of trade unionism. The object of this is both the sociology of professional researchers and the sociology used daily by trade unionists. It is different both from the tradition of the epistemological break between scientific and ordinary knowledge and from the tendency to the indifferentiation of scholarly and ordinary practices proper to ethnomethodology.<br>

Abstract: The article explores how, given the absence of a proper public sphere, twentieth-century Hungarian social research began to use the notion of "reality" in populist socio-reports, the documentary films of the 1970s, and sociological debates. These discussions all shared the assumption that contemporary political elites ignored the "real" conditions of society. Thus it was the duty of social research (socio-reports or sociology proper) to reveal these facts in a manner that was free of ideology. Whereas in North America and Western Europe during the 1960s and 1970s the notion of a directly accessible "reality" had been thrown into question, in Hungary scholarship insisted on this kind of cognitive realism because of social and political reasons. As they argued, "reality" was to be interpreted not as a universal epistemological category, but according to particular terms of the sociology of knowledge. This article explores how the detection of "reality" and "facts" became an ethical vocation within these interrogatory frameworks.<br>

Abstract: A religião é uma enorme projeção de significações humanas. Estas projeções convertem-se, para os seus produtores, na forma de uma realidade de ordem transcendente. De acordo com Peter L. Berger a alienaçāo religiosa é antropologicamente necessária. A partir da fenomenologia da religiāo, cosmos sacralizado em que se constitui toda e qualquer concepçāo do mundo, faz da religiāo um âmbito de estudo para elucidar os mecanismos complexos de sentido e significado da vida humana. Rudolf Otto e Mircea Eliade sāo os fenomenólogos que mais influenciaram o pensamento de Peter L. Berger. Religion is largely a projection of human meanings. These projections are converted in the form of a reality of transcendent order back to their very authors. According to Peter L. Berger religious alienation is anthropologically necessary. From the Phenomenology of Religion, the sacralized cosmos in which any conception of the world is formed makes religion a field study to elucidate the complex mechanisms of sense and meaning of the human life. Rudolf Otto and Mircea Eliade are the phenomenologists that most influenced the thought of Peter L. Berger.<br>

Abstract: The idea/metaphor of the world as a text, essential to the so called linguistic turn of human and social sciences, has a long intellectual history which originates, from the very beginning of Christianity, in Saint Paul's assertion of the presence of a double sense (literal and spiritual) in the Old Testament. Starting from this point, the present paper sets out to describe the development and consolidation of the tradition of Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics which in the 20th century gave rise to a variety of schools and trends that in one way or another maintain the fundamental thesis that reality is a text that is to be deciphered. The article also highlights that the original Christian sources did generate two other lines of intellectual tradition: a more temperate exegetical tradition prevailing in the Catholic world, and furthermore the current Western cultural belief that world is like a book (a belief which kept the terms of the comparison separated and did not confuse them).<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to provide a quick survey of William James's views on the plurality of visions that humans have regarding reality, as a background for more extensive discussions of his views on the plurality of values that orient human thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, as well as his views on the enactment of those values through active resistance to the ways things are and the risk-taking involved in striving to improve the human condition. Consonant with pluralism itself, I intend this discussion to open up rather than close off further considerations of James's views on ethics.<br>

Abstract: Cet article trouve son point de départ dans l'analyse du caractère sévère de Jésus dans l'évangile. Des synoptiques, c'est Matthieu qui met le plus l'accent sur la tension entre les pharisiens et Jésus. Le point culminant est le discours dans le temple dont le noyau est constitué des sept « Ouai » (Mt 23,13-36). Pour expliquer cette sévérité, nous utilisons comme approche méthodique la « pragmatique » de la science de la communication et de la linguistique. L'objectif de la recherche est d'offrir une nouvelle perception de la réalité et d'interpeller sur l'agir moral. This article begins from the analysis of the harsh nature of Jesus in the Gospel. Among the Synoptics, it is Matthew who insists the most on the strain between the Pharisees and Jesus. Its culmination is Jesus' speech in the Temple, at whose centre are the seven "Woes" (Matt. 23 :13-36). To explain this harshness, we will make use of the methodical approach called "pragmatic", in communication science and linguistics. Our aim is to offer a new perception of reality and to challenge to moral action.<br>

Issue: i40172767<br>
Date: 4 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): BAHR HOWARD M.<br>
Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: On traite ici de la mémoire comme lieu central où se noue, en perspective chrétienne, l'identité de l'homme, au cœur du temps et par-delà un «oubli» originaire. On montre comment la «polarité christologico-pneumatologique» propre à la doctrine chrétienne éclaire ce moment. On indique enfin comment la mémoire ainsi comprise s'inscrit dans des réalités anthropologiques générales, avant desquisser certaines incidences de l'orientation proposée en terrain proprement herméneutique. Memory is treated here as the central point where, from a Christian perspective, personal identity is formed at the heart of time and beyond an original "lapse of memory". It is shown how "christo-pneumatological polarity", proper to Christianity, sheds light on this moment, and how memory thus conceived lies in the scope of general anthropological reality. Finally, certain occurrences of the orientation proposed are traced in the specific field of hermeneutics.<br>

Une lecture attentive de la première question de la Tertia pars de la Somme Théologique établit que l'opposition habituelle entre Incarnation et Rédemption se trouve dépassée dans la découverte du mystère pascal de Jésus comme la manifestation et la réalité de Dieu toujours plus grand. La Christologie est alors tout autre chose qu'un appendice : la consummatio totius theologici negotii, clef de voûte et principe de toute la théologie. The article studies the successive and conjunct modifications of the arguments of convenance and the structures the treatise on the Incarnation throughout St. Thomas' itinerary. It is proposed to contest the habit of reducing the place of Christ in the Summa Theologica to a simple redemptive causality. An attentive reading of the first question of the Tertia Pars of the Summa Theologica establishes that the habitual opposition between Incarnation and Redemption is found to be surpassed in the discovery of the Pascal Mystery of Jesus as the manifestation and reality of the always greater God. The Christology is then quite other than a mere appendix: the consummatio totius theologici negotii, keystone and principle of all theology.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: La relation entre spiritualisme et philosophie réflexive peut donner lieu à deux lectures inverses : ou bien la méthode reflexive trouve son fondement dans la reconnaissance de la réalité de l'esprit, ou bien c'est la pratique réflexive qui autorise et au besoin contrôle la portée des affirmations spiritualistes. L'article se situe dans cette seconde lignée. La précession de l'être par l'être qui définit la condition de la conscience ne légitime aucune intuition de l'Absolu, mais bien une affirmation ontologique originaire. L'âme, c'est la passion d'intériorité de cette auto-affirmation manifestante. Quant à l'Esprit, troisième dimension de l'être, c'est un Advenir éthique qui n'est en acte qu'à travers le monde des êtres, dans la rencontre réflexive multilatérale des consciences. The relationship between spiritualism and philosophical reflexivity can be seen in one of two ways: either a recognition of the reality of the spirit gave rise to the reflexive concept, or the practice of reflexivity came first and widened the scope of spiritual affirmations, controlling them when necessary. The article favours the latter view. The ability of a being to form a judgment about itself, and thus create a conscience, does not justify any conclusion about an Absolute, being on the contrary one of the basic statements of ontology. The soul is the result of this active self-judgment emerging from its seclusion. As for the spirit, the third component of the being, this is an ethical by-product which only comes into play through the world of beings, in the multilateral reflexive meeting of consciences.<br>

Article Title: "Sobjectivism": Toward a Constructivist Methodology<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i412377<br>
Date: 6 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Zehfuss Vincent<br>
Abstract: This article outlines a "sobjectivist" methodology that is specifically geared toward the constructivist style of reasoning. The main argument is that constructivist inquiries need to develop not only objectified (or experience-distant) but also subjective (experience-near) knowledge about social and international life. This requirement derives from the fact that constructivism is a postfoundationalist style of reasoning which emphasizes the mutually constitutive dialectics between the social construction of knowledge and the contruction of social reality. By implication, a constructivist methodology should be inductive, interpretive, and historical. The methodical practice of sobjectivism follows a three-step logic from the recovery of subjective meanings to their objectification thanks to contextualization and historicization. A brief discussion of the security-community research program illustrates what sobjectivism looks like in practice. Overall, not only does the development of a consistent methodology systematize the practice of constructivist research, it also fosters engagement and dialog with other international relations approaches. By clarifying where constructivism falls on issues of validity, falsifiability, and generalizability, this article intends to enhance mutual legibility among competing methodologies.<br>

Article Title: Freud, Psychoanalysis, and Sociology: Some Observations on the Sociological Analysis of the Individual<br>
Publisher: Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd. For the London School of Economics<br>
Issue: i224978<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Adorno Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Article Title: Strangers to Themselves: How Interactants Are other than They Are<br>
Publisher: Routledge Journals for the London School of Economics and Political Science<br>
Issue: i225019<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Travers Andrew<br>
Abstract: Analysis of a sequence of literary frames suggests that a heightened experience of interactional reality is also anomically constructive of the frame. In each of 16 frames, Durkheimian anomie neither destroys the frame's integrity nor renders its routine grounds unintelligible, as Goffman and Garfinkel would claim it must. Paradoxically, anomie ritually intensifies the frame. The selves in the paper's sequence of highly ritualized frames are not routine selves, however. They are 'strangers to themselves'. The analysis shows how Mead's 'I' can re-emerge from Goffman's ritual thinking - where the 'I' is collapsed into an interactionally-bound 'me' - as an original manifestation of great importance to interactants, and therefore to society as well. (Parenthetically it is also argued that selves need an element of rituality in order to be selflike and that it is interactional rituality which guarantees the evolution of social life beyond given frames, corpora, cultural repertoires, and collective representations.) The idea that interactants can be strangers to themselves is an advance on Goffman's and Garfinkel's accounts of interactional selfhood, but one that problematizes the prosecution of the interaction sociology that Goffman and Garfinkel pioneer, since strangers to themselves disappear in normal sociological appearances.<br>

Publisher: Institute of British Geographers<br>
Issue: i225701<br>
Date: 1 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Werlen Andrew<br>
Abstract: This paper offers a dialectical interpretation of place. It argues that much of the confusion in the literature on place stems from its failure to engage with the ontological nature of place. This has led to much research implicitly accepting a restrictive Cartesian view of socio-spatial reality. Entrikin's (1991) 'betweenness of place' thesis is a notable recent illustration. In this paper I suggest that the problematic nature of place and its relationship to space can be resolved through a dialectical mode of argumentation. The spatialized dialectic of Henri Lefebvre offers a fruitful framework for reconciling the interaction between place and space insofar as it strives to overcome dualistic conceptions of capitalist spatiality. Lefevbre's dialectical approach will be counterposed to Entrikin's argument. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of the respective perspectives for robust place theorization and place politics.<br>

Author(s): Zago Charles F.<br>
Abstract: Notions of gender have a givenness for most people as they are rooted in fundamental assumptions about the underlying meaning of reality. In Buddhist Thailand, gender notions can be shown to derive from sources that formulate a Buddhist world view. In this paper it is maintained, contrary to the argument of some scholars, that Thai Buddhist culture does not relegate women to a religiously inferior status relative to men. Rather, both males and females who understand the world in Buddhist terms face the same problem of attachment to the world, although the characteristic tension between worldly attachment and orientation toward Buddhist salvation is expressed for females in gender images that are different than those for males.

Abstract: A discussion of the concept of power provides the theoretical basis for a semantic analysis of a case in which power changes hands. It is argued that a relationship of power presumes the capacity of ideas to require submission and that changes of power accompany changes in actors' conceptions of reality. The semantic analysis points to a pan-Indonesian conception of how power is created and destroyed. [power, political anthropology, symbolic analysis, complex organizations, Indonesia]<br>

Abstract: This article describes how the people of Cartago, Costa Rica -- compelled, like each of us, to create -- incorporate the material culture of their town's market and plaza into social situations. In so doing, they move from the physical reality of simply being there to the distinctive social realities of being-in-the-market and being-in-the-plaza. The juxtaposition of these two complementary realities, the article concludes, constitutes the dialectic through which Spanish American culture becomes.

Abstract: Language is constitutive of social reality through the constant articulation and reinforcement of significant linguistic concepts, which give meaning to social relations. Among the Shuar of southeastern Ecuador, discourses on power and knowledge validate the traditional ideological structure and create a new ideological structure through the mobilization of meaning in political speech that legitimates relations of domination. Ideological transformation is assisted by a cultural predisposition to seek non-Shuar sources of technical and symbolic knowledge in the acquisition of power.

Abstract: Recent studies of performance genres suggest that many rituals generate propositional force by manipulating ritual frames and so drawing the audience to reflect upon various levels of performance reality. This article focuses on the fusion of such levels during the performance of a Tibetan opera before an audience of refugee Tibetans living in India, a spectacle wherein the mimetic performance of a mock exorcism became an actual exorcism. The article analyzes this transformation from the combined perspective of theatrical semiosis and speech act theory. [Tibet, performance theory, opera, ritual, theater]<br>

Article Title: Introduction: From the "New Ecology" to the New Ecologies<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227583<br>
Date: 3 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wolf Aletta<br>
Abstract: An earlier ecological anthropology defined its project within the compass of the idealism v. materialism debate. Culture was an adaptive tool, instrumental rather than formal; it was intelligible with respect to its material effects, not - as the idealists would maintain - in terms of itself, as an autonomous, self-determining order of reality. This argument was mounted with respect to bounded, stable, self-regulating, local, or at best regional entities and the environment they inhabited. All of the premises of the earlier ecology have since been challenged, and today's ecologies - symbolic, historical, and political - radically depart from the reductions and elisions of the ecological anthropology of the past. In particular, the new ecologies override the dichotomies that informed and enlivened the debates of the past - nature/culture, idealism/materialism - and they are informed by the literature on transnationalist flows and local-global articulations. This introduction positions Rappaport's work within this historical shift from a polarized field of mutually exclusive frameworks to today's synthetic new ecologies and their antireductive materialism. Rappaport's work, produced over three decades, serves, in and through its own transformations, as a bridge between the reductive materialism of the past and a new-materialist ecology.<br>

Abstract: A conflict is a relational space in crisis in which the antagonists determine, in an interactive dynamic, what is at stake. As the negotiation goes by, ego states his truth line, while alter builds his offensive line based on a truth that becomes reality. Defending one’s truth means also fighting for one’s integrity; in other words, defining my truth is also giving a structure to my integrity, to my own self. If the literature of the I has frequently conflicts in its pages, it is probably because the reading pact is tied up to the truth. But making a narrative of the self out of the configuration system can also get the text in another kind of conflict where the frontiers of the diegetic levels become more and more permeable. Despite everything, the illocutary power in autobiographic literature, seems to change the way the « I » sees himself, and gives him a new ethos that suits him fine.<br>

Abstract: This article treats Mexican
         retablos(devotional paintings) in relation to people's actions. Retablos serve as a basis for seeing, talking about, and interpreting events born from oppressive, modern conditions. Actions and artful representation indicate, respectively, proximity to reality, from near to far—a difference that outlines a space for aesthetic production. I argue that retablos contribute to an aesthetic that orients the senses and the mind against oppressive conditions and toward a positive vision of what the world might be.<br>

Article Title: Lurianic Kabbalah and Its Literary Form: Myth, Fiction, History<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: pft.2009.29.issue-3<br>
Date: October 2009<br>
Author(s): Magid Shaul<br>
Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: Meltzer notes that terms such as “origin” and “displacement” are heavily freighted in the administrative language of immigration, forming the “machinery of political repression.”
         
               She indicates that the tropes invite further study in relation to “any minority discourse/dominant culture dialectic,”70
            
               but does not pursue this line. It is here that I would like to pick up and adapt her notion of the metaphysics of origin to my analysis of twentieth-century recombinatory and cannibalistic poetic procedures and their theorization in the Americas. The displacement or deterritorialization of literary texts and their fragments has an analog in the movement of peoples from the Old to the so-called New World, the language of mastery and domination, and tropes of emancipation and vengeful incorporation. Therefore, while the formal strategies of a poetics of copia are part of literary making from ancient times, the theories by which copia is understood in the twentieth century have arisen within the sociohistorical reality of migration integral to the colonial matrix of power, which in turn depends on capitalism.71

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The 1971 article focused on three major points: (1) Africa as historical reality and religious image; (2) the involuntary presence of the African American community in the United States; and (3) the experience and symbol of God in the experience of blacks; these points overlap. I pointed out how Africa for African Americans was obviously a reference to the continent of Africa but that it was that and more. It became an image and symbol for the possibility for another and alternative beginning and way of being in the world. Africa was indeed a continent with a very large landmass and simultaneously the basis for a powerful orienting discourse about the nature and being of peoples of African descent in the world. The involuntary stance and presence of African people in their diasporic existence in the New World is paralleled by the destruction of aboriginal peoples and acquisition of their lands. These events have prevented any ultimate trust in the rhetorics of egalitarianism and freedom that accompanied the ascendancy of Europe. The manifestation and naming of gods and divine beings as centering symbols of the orientational process express themselves in a precise manner within this situation and become the resource for the maintenance of one's humanity within the context.<br>

Abstract: The three-drug protocol is designed to circumvent the very possibility of establishing whether or not the condemned person is suffering or in pain, whether or not he or she is conscious at the moment of death, and therefore whether or not the punishment is cruel and unusual as defined by the Court. Furthermore, this fabulous fantasy of painless death disavows the reality that we don't know how to define what constitutes consciousness of death because firsthand testimony is impossible. As long as Lawrence Brewer, recently executed in Texas, goes out snoring as if in a sound sleep (which he apparently did), at some level we can reassure ourselves that his death is the least cruel, most usual, and perhaps even the most desired, namely, dying in his sleep.<br>

Abstract: If the thinkers I cite are right, remembering is both transformative of that in which it occurs and resistant to its own transformation. It is transformative in that the event of remembering strengthens living connections, patterns, and configurations of valences in the neural networks—or institution—in which it happens, and it does so at the expense of alternative connections, patterns, and configurations. It is resistant in the same instant and for the same reason. It resists mirroring its own surroundings, copying or projecting its immediate reality. It resists
         presentation and thus refuses to berepresentation. It both is and enables differing.<br>

Abstract: One of the pleasures I have had in doing philosophy of technology—in addition to getting to play with the new toys (virtual reality caves in Sweden, robots in Japan)—is to serve as an external adviser for dissertations from which I learn so much. Here I will shamelessly borrow, and cite, an interesting thesis being developed by Galit Wellner from Bar-Ilan University. She notes that today a “tool” far more common than a hammer, but which functions as a
            ready-to-handdevice, is thecell phone. She is doing an empirical- turn case study of its evolution and role with exciting implications.<br>

Abstract: That correlationism is a red herring is made plain by turning to the most sensible voice in the new debate, Bruno Latour, who was a student of Michel Serres's and whose work in “science studies”—conducted under the motto of the title of his first major book,
            We Have Never Been Modern—has been to show that science does not drop out of the sky. One would be hard put to differentiate what Latour calls his “non-modernism” from what Continental philosophers (loosely called “postmodern”) are saying. Indeed Latour's work had led to the charge that even he does not “believe in reality,” an objection that only momentarily left him speechless but quickly led to a wonderful book entitledPandora's Hope.
                  There he argues that, far from being opposed to each other, our power of “construction”—read “constitution”—goes hand in hand with “reality.” The more construction—the more sophisticated the scientific community, the more complicated the experiment, the more technical the laboratory instruments, the more funding for research—the more reality science will attain. Unhappily, Latour dismisses phenomenology as a “philosophy of consciousness,” as if the entire history of phenomenology after Husserl never happened. Don Ihde, one of the SPEP's most distinguished thinkers, has called Latour to task on just this point.32
               
                  Latour's point applies no less to religion.33
               
                  Religious beliefs and practices are certainly constructed—in concrete cultures, languages, traditions, and historical worldviews. The people whose practices these are understand (just like the people who actually practice science) both that they have composed these prayers, constructed these places of worship, made these statues, and so on34
               andthat in them they access something real that they have not made.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>

Abstract: It seems to me that this provides the basis for a good answer to the question that was posed at the outset of this article, that is: “Is a hermeneutic phenomenology ‘wide open’ enough for a minimal phenomenology?” This is indeed the case. For, just as Freud's mixed discourse means that each discourse points to a discourse outside itself, the same could be said of the relation between Deleuze and phenomenology.
      
               The key here is to recognize that the nonsignifying or the impersonal is on the way to meaning and on the way to consciousness. And at the same time, phenomenological discourse necessarily points back to a nonsignifying or impersonal reality that precedes and gives rise to it. The role of a hermeneutic phenomenology is to mediate between these two discourses by traveling along this path back and forth between meaning and its becoming, following its composition and decomposition in the movement from sense to non-sense, from the impersonal to the personal, from the formless to form—and back again.26<br>

Abstract: In this work, I argue that creative metaphors are formed when some persistent problem, caused by an inadequacy in preexisting knowledge, descends into the collective unconscious, is reconfigured unconsciously in novel ways, and then reemerges back into consciousness where the impasse is resolved by the metaphorical expression of new knowledge. To develop this position, I (1) review and critique some well-known language-based studies of metaphor, (2) summarize psychoanalytic and depth psychological approaches to the psyche as one way to overcome the shortcomings of the language-based scholarship, (3) relate C. G. Jung's account of the psyche and his related notion of synchronicity to creative metaphors, (4) graft a quantum physics approach to material reality back onto Jung's work as a provisional structure of the collective unconscious, and finally, (5) offer some suggestions about how creative metaphors might work psychologically.<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not envision so explicit an invitation (or even exhortation) to action. Rather he insists on understanding how poetic or fictional texts refer to the world outside of language. In a significant move, Ricoeur rejects the false choice between conceiving of a text as either a transparent window into conscious authorial intention or as a closed, self-referential world. His approach instead treats authorship as one textual influence among many. Ricoeur says that his formulation of refiguration “is part of a hermeneutics that aims less at restoring the author's intention behind the text than at making explicit the movement by which the text unfolds, as it were, a world in front of itself” (1984, 1:81). Here Ricoeur directly engages the poststructuralist critique of authorial intention and textual reference. Yet he offers an insightful and sensible alternative to the idea that texts should be understood primarily as effects of language.
         
               Like Ricoeur, I see authorial/creative intention as an important aspect of reading texts of public memory that is nonetheless only part of the broader context of textual production and address. The intentions of creators leave indelible marks on the texts and thus on the public memories they disseminate. But many other factors affect the nature of a text, and Ricoeur's approach emphasizes that reality.12<br>

Abstract: During periods when Shaw was debilitated by illness, injury, and outright prostration, GBS reconceives convalescence and medical procedures as occasions of revelation and rejuvenation. In another
      Saturday Reviewpiece, written in May 1898, the playwright describes being subject to a practice he execrated, vivisection to remedy his infected foot, but, through it, he finally achieves an “[understanding of] the British drama and the British actor.”
            The sedative so splits his character that, when he awakens, only his “sentimental side” initially returns, without his “morality,” “common sense,” or “incorrigible Protestant respectability”: “For the first time in my life, I tasted the bliss of having no morals to restrain me from lying, and no sense of reality to restrain me from romancing…. I acted and lied in the most touchingly sympathetic fashion…. Artistically, I was an immense success: morally, I simply had no existence.”10
         
            Shaw describes a zombie state, bereft of “the chill of a moral or intellectual impulse,” in which his “consciousness [became] absolutely fictitious,”11
         
            and equates it to the anesthetic rather than aesthetic effect of actors, managers, and playwrights in British theater. Inveighing against theatrical bathos as a dangerous blend of vapid conformity and blinding romanticism, it is, for Shaw, the responsibility of the critic to rouse patients etherized on a table and endeavor to cultivate a dialectic theater poised for social reform.12<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, Kant's corpus is essentially a philosophy of limits.
         
               In the Kantian universe, apart from limitations on action, there are also dimensions of reality beyond the epistemological reach of the species. Specifically, human knowing is limited to objects conditioned by time and space. We mortals, for example, cannot know a hypothesized God, his purposes and methods—or any other postulated transcendental entity—because the efficacy of speculative reason ends where the border of the unconditioned begins. Stated technically, humans can know phenomena, things that are perceived or interpreted, but not things as they are in themselves independent of the mind (noumena). This means that any notion of totalization, of obtaining absolute knowledge, in the manner articulated by, say, Hegel, is chimerical. For Kant, then, neither the theoretical nor the empirical sphere furnishes adequate grounds to support the contention that a reconciliation of freedom and nature is possible. Now, if nothing in our knowledge or experience indicates that freedom can be rehabilitated, a potentially devastating dilemma arises for Kant: how can he save his ethics, which presupposes that ought implies can, if the will is inexorably impotent in the face of omnipresent evil? How can we do what we must if we are denied autonomy? If we cannot emancipate the will, a major plank in Kant's philosophical edifice will collapse under the weight of an unresolvable aporia. Kant, of course, is well aware of the impasse and in his29
            Critique of Judgmentposits the transformative power of art as the means of mediating between actuality and freedom. Unfortunately, Kant never fully develops the idea of how symbolic expression, a product of the creative imagination, can genuinely resuscitate the vulnerable will, so the question he himself believes religion poses—what may I hope?—remains incompletely answered. However, this lacuna is all the inspiration Ricoeur needs to bui~<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: As he expresses in his reading of
         Don Quixote, the idea of faith is central to Bloch's conception of utopia in the West. He sees a positive aspect in religion, which is faith having a goal when reality falls short of material fulfillment. Bloch sees the biblical Judeo-Christian tradition as the historical source of utopian ideation in the West, at least in its mystical, rather than dogmatic, emphasis on transformation (a view he shares with theologian Paul Tillich). For this reason, he can be sympathetic to religion—another way in which he resembles a traditional liberal humanist more than a typical Marxist would.<br>

Abstract: Leopold Bloom, in
         Ulysses, expansively describes the Utopian as affording “no known method from the known to the unknown.”
               Utopia is a place that is impossible to arrive at by any known route, in that it is not really a place at all. It is therefore essential that, in order to reach Utopia, one takes an unknown and unknowable route, a path determined by its indeterminacy, a passage that deconstructs its own rationalistic epistemological foundations. It is only in its paradoxical nature that such a route, beyond sense (which forbids entry into the unreal), might discover the reality of that unreality. For, in the end, despite its fantastical absurdities—its self-conscious nowhereness—Joyce's Dublin, like Butler's Erewhon, is the opposite of nowhere: it is somewhere. It is by inscribing the material (the somewhere) within the dream (the nowhere) that the dream might be sustained; and it is also by inscribing the dream within the real that material existence can continue.166<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: One way to ensure a verifiable utopian dimension to works of architecture and urbanism (in addition to keeping the four elements introduced earlier in mind) would be to stay close to German sociologist Karl Mannheim's (1893–1947) definition of Utopia. Doing so provides claims to Utopia for architecture and urbanism with terms of criticism by which they could be analyzed more closely and carefully. In this way, the incongruence of such claims with Mannheim's definition of Utopia (and those of others) might be more readily ascertained: “However, we should not regard utopia as every state of mind which is incongruous with and transcends the immediate situation (and in this sense, ‘departs from reality’). Only those orientations transcending reality will be referred to by us as utopian which, when they pass over into conduct, tend to shatter, either partially or wholly, the order which prevails at the time.”
         
               Divergence from Mannheim's definition is most explicitly observable in the degree to which most so-called utopian movements in architecture and urbanism collapse under the burden of their own ideological hollowness, confirmed by their inability, in Mannheim's words, “to shatter, either partially or wholly, the order which [prevailed] at the time … as [they pass] into conduct.”14
            
               As Manfredo Tafuri (1935–1994) observed, the reproduction function of architecture is all but inevitable, captured as it is within the cultural norms of the building industry in particular but more generally within the prevailing sociopolitical and economic conditions of capitalism, which led German philosopher of hope Ernst Bloch (1885–1977) to believe that to be “true,” as he called it, architecture would have to wait for radically transformed conditions to be renewed. In fact, when considered in this way, the utopian prospect of modern architecture was all but nonexistent; more so, it was rarely if ever the issue.15<br>

Issue: sciefictstud.38.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>
