  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: The debate on animal souls and the problem of theodicy with respect to animal suffering, a discussion that has been a feature of European thought since the seventeenth century, became the perfect pillar for those philosophies that were born in the wake of scientific discoveries and that aimed to assert the unreasonableness of Christianity. Such philosophies questioned how a good and almighty God could let innocent animals undergo all the evils they endure daily. One solution was to deny to animals feelings and reason; for instance, Descartes’s theory of the animal-machine suggested that animals were unable to feel pleasure and<br>

  Rhetoric and Liberal Arts Education in an Age of Consumerism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: In Cicero’s rhetorical works, the concept of genre appears in two rather different and largely independent contexts. One of these involves the division of style into three general types (
                  tria genera dicendi), while the other has to do with the conventional tripartite division of types of speeches (tria genera causarum). Among recent scholars, attention has centered on the first of these divisions, and for good reason. Although Cicero did not originate these stylistic categories, his formulation of them proved to have an abiding influence,¹ and he applied them in ways that suggest a striking and probably original contribution to rhetorical<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In everyday language, the term “paradox” is used to refer to any claim or argument that contrasts with what is usually considered obvious. In a more specific and philosophical sense, a paradox is a claim or an argument that develops from apparently true premises and leads to a seemingly absurd (self-contradictory or logically unacceptable) conclusion. The term is also sometimes used in the context of religion to refer to a form of fideism professing a religious belief even when, or precisely because, that belief defies reason (as paradigmatically expressed by Tertullian’s
                  Credo quia absurdum). And then there is at least<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: This chapter argues that moving beyond realism—to post-realism—requires moving beyond the gender-blindness of conventional accounts.¹ My argument weaves together areas of inquiry that are usually treated in isolation. Intellectual developments associated with the rise of systematic inquiry in ancient Greece—marked by the shift from rhetoric to philosophy and its foundational dichotomies of reason over affect, mind over body—comprise one area of inquiry. Another is the study of historical-political developments—the shift to centralized authority and its dichotomies of public over private, civilized over “other”—within which Western science and political theory “emerged.” A third area of<br>

  Abstract: A hard-drinking Irishman who emigrated to Philadelphia in 1783, John M’Kean was a notorious wife beater. He apparently hit his wife daily, sometimes for no reason, sometimes for trifling reasons, sometimes just because he was drunk and was in the habit. One wonders what his neighbors were doing during these constant batterings; nonetheless, when he finally killed his wife and was hanged for it, one observer ventured that “the safety of society requires it.” But it would seem that

  Abstract: The various themes and narrative threads that constitute Canto XXI all come together in Canto XXII : the interrelated notions of thresholds and conversion; the shift from philosophy to theology and from philosophical prose to religious poetry; the confrontation of human reason and its limitations with profound religious mysteries; and the bittersweet celebration of the ancient world, of Virgil for the excellence of his poetic model, and of Virgil’s works for the moral and spiritual influence they reputedly exerted.

The give-and-take of speech acts in the imaginary dialogue about Mendelssohn’s concerto helps point the way to something more resonant, but we need to go further in that direction.

  Abstract: The complex of substance abuse, gambling, crime, and violence described in the previous chapter constitutes the most common reason the men I studied gave for conversion to Evangelicalism. Leaving the analysis there would amount to a serious distortion.

  Author(s) FISCHER MICHAEL M. J.<br>
  Abstract: Madness or psychotic illness fundamentally challenges local understandings of human nature, as well as the theorization of subjectivity. Societies and individuals understand madness in various ways: as possession by haunting spirits, a flight from reason, a regression to childlike or primitive states, an essential mode of being in the world and a distinctive form of human subjectivity, the entry into an alternative world, or a mode of deeply disturbed and pathological subjectivity reflecting disordered brain chemistry. Whatever the interpretation, the chaotic and disturbing qualities of psychosis are deeply threatening to those undergoing the experience as well as to their families<br>

  Abstract: The last two decades of the twentieth century witnessed a popular representation of Sikhs in the Indian media as bloodthirsty avengers rather than as bloodied victims. The principal reason for this stereotype was the rise of Sikh nationalism in the early 1980s. Akali Dal (army of the immortal), the main political party of the Sikhs in the Punjab, was demanding increased autonomy for all the states of India. During that period, relations with the Indian government became increasingly strained as a result.

  Abstract: For over a quarter of a century, scholars have been interested in a set of questions broadly grouped under the heading “Derrida and Religion.” Since the 1980s, when Derrida began to apply deconstructive insights directly to questions of faith and religion, the provocation of this engagement has remained of major concern across the humanities.¹ For this reason, it would be wrong to consider the question of Derrida and religion simply as a partial look at an important thinker, similar to, say, Hegel and aesthetics or Hume and politics, where research is limited to the overlap between the two: the conjunction<br>

Ethics is not a matter of moral argument but of solicitation by the other, who by virtue of sheer otherness resists violence.

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Abstract: Contemporary attempts to justify tolerance and toleration converge on the importance of reason. The argument for this, on behalf of what we might call the “model of reasonable toleration,” is that reason is available to everyone who is willing to give to others what they want for themselves. Its laws apply universally, and even though its results are more reliable than those that come from other sources of knowledge, it is always open to revision. This makes it the right candidate for being the “neutral” yet “case-sensitive” arbitrator in societies with conflicting notions of the common good. As Rainer Forst,<br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: What can be excused need not be forgiven. The excuse excuses the excusable because the excuse, according to Vladimir Jankélévitch, is of the order of reason and understanding. What can be excused has grounds for excuse. Conversely, what is inexcusable exceeds the parameters of understanding and surpasses the contextualization of the misdeed. As Jankélévitch claims, sometimes a misdeed is performed as a cry for help, a cry to be understood, or even as a cry to be loved. He therefore encourages us to try to understand as much as we can understand, but he is also insistent that there are<br>

  Author(s) Manolopoulos Mark<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney is a possibility thinker, a philosopher, novelist, and poet fired by a passion for/of God. For Kearney, philosophy links imagination and affectivity with reason in a rhetoric of persuasion aiming for individual and societal transfiguration. In other words, as I read him, philosophy is not an abstract-theoretical exercise dedicated to getting things straight, finding solutions for particular theoretic problems. Rather, for Kearney, philosophy is a way of life, a spiritual exercise¹ working toward the incitement of passion for visionary transformation and cultural change rather than the elaboration of grand systems and the elimination of paradoxes.

  Book Title: Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Waldmeir John C.<br>
  Abstract: The metaphor of the Church as a bodyhas shaped Catholic thinking since the Second Vatican Council. Its influence on theological inquiries into Catholic nature and practice is well-known; less obvious is the way it has shaped a generation of Catholic imaginative writers. Cathedrals of Bone is the first full-length study of a cohort of Catholic authors whose art takes seriously the themes of the Council: from novelists such as Mary Gordon, Ron Hansen, Louise Erdrich, and J. F. Powers, to poets such as Annie Dillard, Mary Karr, Lucia Perillo, and Anne Carson, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright John Patrick Shanley. Motivated by the inspirational yet thoroughly incarnational rhetoric of Vatican II, each of these writers encourages readers to think about the human body as a site-perhaps the most important site-of interaction between God and human beings. Although they represent the body in different ways, these late-twentieth-century Catholic artists share a sense of its inherent value. Moreover, they use ideas and terminology from the rich tradition of Catholic sacramentality, especially as it was articulated in the documents of Vatican II, to describe that value. In this way they challenge the Church to take its own tradition seriously and to reconsider its relationship to a relatively recent apologetics that has emphasized a narrow view of human reason and a rigid sense of orthodoxy.<br>

With the accomplishment of a thoroughly rationalized world, the categories that had promised to give meaning to experience proved untenable. The problem of the irrational appeared to be immanent to reason rather than merely an aberration from its proper functions, the aspirations of philosophy appeared to be inherently contradictory, and its ideals seemed to harbor coercive deceptions and tyrannies.

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

  Abstract: The vision of the self that emerges from Kleist’s reading of Kantian ethics differs sharply from the figure of specular self-determination generally associated with Idealist thought. In forcing us to reconsider the assumption that language can be a medium of rational activity, Kleist seems to part company from those inheritors of Kant who accord ultimate primacy to the authority of reason. At the same time, one could argue that Kleist shares with both Kant and the Idealists a sense of the volatile power of literary language and a more general concern with the historical dimensions of artistic creation.

The capital letter “L,” one element of the symbol for Larousse dictionaries and encyclopedias in france (L is also the first letter of the word “book” in romance languages), is there for a good reason: it “scatters in every direction.” L (either for “livre” or for “Larousse,” but let’s choose “livre”!) strews to the winds: Would the L therefore be “drunk” [

That this Judaism is both feminist and cosmopolitan follows from its commitment to these three great organizing values. Like the intellectual leaders who gave rise to Reform Judaism in Germany, I conceive of God’s kingdom as the kingdom of ends, a virtual polity, containing both true autonomy and true community, that organizes our moral hopes and efforts in this world of confusion, herdlike obedience, and unenlightened<br>

  Book Title: Mind in Architecture-Neuroscience, Embodiment, and the Future of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D.

  Book Title: Theology in the Flesh-How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Sanders John<br>
  Abstract: Metaphors and other mental tools are used to reason (not just speak) about God, salvation, truth, and morality. Figurative language structures our theological and moral reasoning in powerful ways. This book uses an approach known as cognitive linguistics to explore the incredibly rich ways our conceptual tools, derived from embodied life and culture, shape the way we understand Christian teachings and practices. The cognitive revolution has generated amazing insights into how human minds make sense of the world. This book applies these insights to the ways Christians think about topics such as God, justice, sin, and salvation. It shows that Christians often share a set of very general ideas but disagree on what the Bible means or the moral stances we should take. It explains why Christians often develop a number of appropriate but sometimes incompatible ways to understand the Bible and various doctrines. It assists Christians in understanding those with whom they disagree. Hopefully, simply better understanding how and why people think the way they do will foster better dialogue and greater humility.<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Abstract: This essay investigates the theological issues associated with the so-called theological turn in French phenomenology.¹ The burden of the inquiry is threefold: to question the terms of the debate as elaborated by Dominique Janicaud; to suggest a possible reason for the stalemate in the debate that has developed in response to those terms; and to present a more
                  theologicallyattentive perspective that can overcome this deadlock from within specifically phenomenological strictures. The claim will be advanced that Christian radical phenomenology tacitly and illicitly deploys the theological categories of grace and the supernatural, leading to unwarranted claims about manifestation that occlude<br>

But from Hesiod we also learn that poetry itself is not a kind of learning but a species of ecstasy. No one studies to be a poet. No one asks to be such a thing.

  Abstract: Understood as an event in the doctor-patient relationship, healing is at first sight what the patient expects from the doctor, but not what he always obtains from him. There is thus a discrepancy between the patient’s hope regarding the power that he attributes to the doctor on the grounds of the latter’s knowledge and the doctor’s recognition of the limits of his own efficacy. There, without doubt, lies the main reason why, of all the objects specific to medical thought, healing is the one that doctors have considered the least.

  Book Title: The Heart Has Its Reasons-Towards a Theological Anthropology of the Heart<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Tóth Beáta<br>
  Abstract: This book explores a hitherto neglected area of theological anthropology: the unity of human emotionality and rationality embodied in the biblical concept of the heart. While the theological contours of human reason have for long been clearly drawn and presented as the exclusive seat of the image of God, affectivity has been relegated to a secondary position. With the reintegration of the body into recent philosophical and theological discourses, a number of questions have arisen: if the image (also) resides in the body, how does this change one’s view of the theological significance of human affectivity? In what way is our likeness to God realized in the whole of what we are? Can one overcome the traditional dissociation between intellect and affectivity by a renewed theory of love? In conversation with patristic and medieval authors (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus, Aquinas) and in dialogue with more recent interlocutors (Pascal, Ricoeur, Marion, Milbank, John Paul II), this work pursues a novel theological vision of the essential unity of our humanity.<br>

  Abstract: What are the theological contours of human emotionality? This has been the guiding question throughout my inquiry. Does theological reflection furnish any graspable points of orientation concerning the significance of the emotions and affectivity besides the clearly formulated tenets it provides concerning the theological role of the intellect? In order to find an appropriate answer, I first had to delineate the context within which the issue can be adequately treated in a theological manner. The cultural historical claim that there is a rupture, a dissociation, between intellect and sensibility, reason and emotion, seems to articulate a deep-seated experience of our<br>

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on the idea of wilderness in the poetry of Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder, consequently ignoring other writers and poets whose work also reflects that concept. The selection of Jeffers and Snyder delimits an otherwise impossibly large field, and there is some reason to think that the choice is sound since “ecological consciousness seems most vibrant in the poetic mode. The poetic voices of Jeffers and Snyder, so rare in modern poetry but frequently found in primal people’s oral tradition, are a virtual cascade of celebration of Nature/God and being.”¹ We have already argued that Modernism—or,<br>

  Abstract: Newbigin’s view of humanity is one that acknowledges human sinfulness while maintaining the value and worth of human persons as God’s creation. His methodology is to discuss Christian doctrine in dialogue with the Enlightenment and post-modern thinking. The Enlightenment sought to free humanity from the ‘ dogma’ of original sin because they believed that “the most dangerous and destructive of all the dogmas which have perverted human reason is the dogma of original sin.”¹ Enlightenment thinkers saw the significance of the doctrine of original sin as central to the whole Christian ‘system.’ If humanity is not, in fact, sinful, then<br>

Strictly considered, however, both the beloved human’s infidelity (human sin) and the misery of the beloved human’s infidelity (the consequences of human sin) comprise the occasion for divine selfsacrifice. Neither sin nor its consequences ever appear isolated from one another, cannot even occur apart from one another. For this reason, previously, I examined as one formal characteristic of human sin the indissoluble bond between sin and its consequences.

  Abstract: In a still-influential book published sixty-three years ago, Harry Jaffa argued that St. Thomas Aquinas “mistakes Aristotle’s intention,” and for that reason Thomas endeavors to “save” the character of the
                  Nicomachean Ethic’s magnanimous man “in accordance with what Thomas evidently considers a higher standard of perfection.”¹ The higher standard of perfection Jaffa has in mind is “Christian ethics,” as revealed in an epigram from Winston Churchill that Jaffa uses to open his book: “It is baffling to reflect that what men call honor does not correspond always to Christian ethics.” Jaffa’s argument is not simply that Aristotle’s account of the<br>

  Abstract: Influenced by recent efforts to reunite nature and grace, the thought of Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI seizes on the harmonious interpenetration of both orders. Exploiting the creative tension between these orders, the pontiffs expound a paradox: nature realizes its own autonomy only when it mediates a higher synthesis. A theme thus uniting their work concerns nature as grace’s sacrament. In John Paul, this theme undergirds the reciprocity between faith and reason and guides his reflections on the eucharist. In Benedict, nature understood as grace’s sacrament structures the relation between justice and charity. In developing this relation, the<br>

Graffiti are generally understood to be a form of defacement, to compromise the integrity and value of the public surfaces on which they appear. For this reason, Susan Stewart has argued in an essay on graffiti as crime and art, “It is interesting to see how graffiti becomes dirt once we consider, in the mode of much recent cognitive anthropology, that dirt is something in the wrong<br>

  Abstract: In an article entitled ‘On the Cunning of Imperialist Reason’, Pierre Bourdieu and Loïc Wacquant (1999) refer to theorization as ‘the power to universalize particularisms linked to a singular historical tradition by causing them to be misrecognized as such’ (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1999, 41). In other words, theorization is understood as a form of neutralization of the historical context. In this, as in other pieces, Bourdieu showed reluctance to extract concepts – understood as structured structures – from the contexts of their production, or from their structuring structures (Robbins 1994).

He offers a personal gathering of influences on his own work as guides to the uses of philosophy in our search for sense and meaning. In concise, direct, and deeply felt chapters, Peperzak moves from Plato, Plotinus, and the Early Christian theologians to Anselm, Bonaventure, Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, Hegel, and Levinas. Throughout these carefully linked essays, he touches on the fundamental ideas-from reason and faith to freedom and tradition-that inform the questions his work has consistently addressed, most specifically those concerning philosophy as a practice.<br>

  Abstract: In many ways, the possibilities for contemporary philosophical and theological thinking have been determined by Kant. Whether explicitly or implicitly, religion has been thought consistently either within, along, or beyond the limits legislated by classical modern reason. At the same time, its status has remained problematic, because it was left out of the fundamental sources of human knowledge according to Kant’s critique. Although he essentially appended religion onto morality, since that time, religion has flirted with and been skirted by scientific theoretical knowledge, ethics, and aesthetics. In his

Of course, both bounce their thoughts off the second commandment of Exod 20 (and Deut 5). Yet Freud’s interpretation runs the risk of replicating precisely what the ban seeks to overcome, for the abstraction he espies in the ban is precisely the move that reinstalls idolatry.

They were often a little, at times much, older than him, and their lives subordinate to that of the male narrator, both in narrative terms—that is to say, they were never narrators—and in terms of sheer content.

  Book Title: Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker-A Study of the Prose<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacKillop James<br>
  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s unexpected death in August 2013 brought to completion his body of work, and scholars are only now coming to understand the full scale and importance of this extraordinary career. The Nobel Prize–winning poet, translator, and playwright from the North of Ireland is considered the most important Irish poet after Yeats and, at the time of his death, arguably the most famous living poet. For this reason, much of the scholarship to date on Heaney has understandably focused on his poetry. O’Brien’s new work, however, focuses on Heaney’s essays, book chapters, and lectures as it seeks to understand how Heaney explored the poet’s role in the world. By examining Heaney’s prose, O’Brien teases out a clearer understanding of Heaney’s sense of the function of poetry as an act of public intellectual and ethical inquiry. In doing so, O’Brien reads Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European tradition, considering him alongside Heidegger, Derrida, Lacan, and Adorno. Studying Heaney within this theoretical and philosophical tradition sheds new and useful light on one of the greatest creative minds of the twentieth century.<br>

Instead, the different forms of transformation need to be assessed separately. ‘Change’, which sounds unitary, is in reality highly diversified, as the previous chapter has argued.

  Abstract: The theory of fiction is perhaps the most difficult aspect of the philosophy of literature, as well as the one that has attracted the most sustained scholarly attention. For some curious reason, commentary on the subject has produced not only some penetrating insights but also more than its fair share of embarrassing banalities. Gregory Currie, for example, informs us that ‘we say that an inference is reasonable when it has a relatively high degree of reasonableness, unreasonable when its degree of reasonableness is very low’.¹ Peter Lamarque impresses on us the fact that ‘fictional characters, like Mr. Allworthy or Miss<br>

  Abstract: Animal and human gestures are used for action but also as signposts, symbols, and to indicate intention. They are neither simple nor complex. They are simplex because, in a very global and immediate way, they enable the brain to grasp a reality, an emotion, a thought, or a complex social relationship. Gesture is a fundamental mark of culture and art, which are always simplex expressions. Gesture is essential to them. Drawing, painting, music, mime, acting, sculpture, and dance are always expressed in gestures. For this reason, we must not be content with a physiology (or a philosophy) of action. We<br>

  How to Write an Argument WHAT STUDENTS AND TEACHERS REALLY NEED TO KNOW from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npkd5">Clueless in Academe</a><br>
  Author(s) Hoberek Andrew<br>
  Abstract: IN THE LAST CHAPTER I presented evidence that students write more cogently about a text when they respond to another commentator than when they respond directly to the text itself. I argued that when students write poorly (on other subjects as well as literature), the reason is often that they are asked to generate an idea or interpretation in a void rather than to enter a conversation. But given the unfamiliarity of the conversations of the intellectual world, most students need help grasping these conversations and writing them into their texts. If this argument is valid, it follows that

  Abstract: In this lecture we continue discussing approaches to interpretation. Before we talk further about E. D. Hirsch and then move to Wolfgang Iser, I want to go back to Gadamer and say something more about his implied taste in books, about the kind of literary and intellectual canon that his approach to hermeneutics establishes. You remember that Gadamer is concerned with the norm of classicism, which later in your excerpt he begins to call “tradition.” The reason tradition is so important for him is not quite the same as the reason tradition is important for a political or cultural conservative;<br>

  Abstract: THE CENSORIOUS CHARGE that Christian thinking relies on faith, not reason, is as old as the church itself. As early as the mid second century the physician and philosopher Galen complained that it was pointless to engage Christians in discussion because they never give arguments for what they believe. They only make appeals to “God commanded” or “God spoke.” In
                  True Doctrine,written about the same time, Celsus echoed Galen’s accusation: “Some Christians,” he wrote, “do not even want to give or to receive a reason for what they believe, and use expressions such as ‘Do not ask questions, just<br>

  Abstract: Almost since the inception of moving pictures, those pictures have often featured dance. The obvious reason for this is that the natural subject of moving pictures is movement. And dances—along with hurtling locomotives, car chases, cattle stampedes, tennis matches, intergalactic dog-fights, and the like—move. Thus, a significant portion of the history of moving pictures involves dance movement. Many moving-picture makers have devoted admirable amounts of effort and imagination to portraying dance in or through media as diverse as film, video, and computer animation.

  Book Title: Abraham's Children-Liberty and Tolerance in an Age of Religious Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): CLARK KELLY JAMES<br>
  Abstract: In this vitally important book, fifteen influential practitioners of the Abrahamic religions address religious liberty and tolerance from the perspectives of their own faith traditions. Former President Jimmy Carter, Rabbi Arik Ascherman, Indonesia's first democratically elected president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and the other writers draw on their personal experiences and on the sacred writings that are central in their own religious lives. Rather than relying on "pure reason," as secularists might prefer, the contributors celebrate religious traditions and find within them a way toward mutual peace, uncompromised liberty, and principled tolerance. Offering a counterbalance to incendiary religious leaders who cite Holy Writ to justify intolerance and violence, the contributors reveal how tolerance and respect for believers in other faiths stands at the core of the Abrahamic traditions.<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

By assuring high-quality care, whether by providing it directly in public institutions or by supporting private caregivers, society could demonstrate its appreciation to a whole generation. High-quality care is an ethical concern in at least two senses: providing good care for the elderly is itself an ethical obligation; and care must be provided in an ethical manner, that is, the human dimensions of care ought to take the central place.<br>

And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

  Abstract: Proclamations of reason’s eclipse, like many a categorical dismissal, have shown themselves to be a bit hasty. Perhaps the life of practical reason, as a mode of reflection open to the collectivity, may be thought of as a generational phenomenon.¹ In any historical period, there are likely to be cultures in which reason and rhetoric have been poisoned. But it seems premature to pronounce any state of affairs, however extreme, as having eliminated forever the prospects for recovery. In the retrospection of dark times, utopian thought can appear foolish. But some such thought may be necessary if possibilities for reflection<br>

  Book Title: Reasoning from Faith-Fundamental Theology in Merold Westphal’s Philosophy of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SANDS JUSTIN<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

  Abstract: Semiotics and deconstruction deal with the question of text, its meaning and interpretation. They both are significant and influential contemporary theories of meaning. However, the sense of meaning and interpretation provided by them is very different. They are contradictory rather then complementary theories. Semiotics is general theory of signs which intends to clarify signs and to “make our ideas clear”, while deconstruction stresses the notion of “indecidability” of meaning and intends to refutation of logocentrism. If the rational analysis is still the main method of semiotics, certainly deconstruction focuses on the limits of reason and opens avenue for irrationalism. The<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: So far, the argument against the autonomy project or, more specifically, the religion-within-the-limits-of-reason-alone project has proceeded in two stages, unequal in length. First, a crucial premise of the enterprise has shown itself to be unsustainable. It is the assumption that human reason is universal, part of the standard equipment of human nature. As such, it is presumed to be objective, neutral, presuppositionless, the only source of reliable knowledge. As such, it is “nonsectarian” by contrast with the plurality of “religions of the book,” those that appeal to the authority of some particular divine revelation and are in this way heteronomous.<br>

And it is to entertain worldviews in which tribal, local, regional, national, and other differences are mere artifacts of time, inessential contingencies, instances of good luck or bad fortune, and facts that cannot serve as bases for reason-based values and actions.<br>

Unfortunately, such a hope is mere fantasy; Kant uses the term in a bewildering variety of ways, at times making it close to impossible to determine whether he is referring to (among others) general logic, transcendental logic, transcendental analytic, a “special” logic relative to a specific science, a “natural” logic, a logic intended for the “learned” (Gelehrter), some hybrid of these logics, or even some still more abstract notion<br>

  Abstract: The characterization of societies as ʺegalitarianʺ — in Borneo as elsewhere in the non-Western world — has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years (Boehm 1993; Flanagan and Rayner 1988; Flanagan 1989; Woodburn 1982). Even so, despite this newfound interest, compared to ʺhierarchyʺ, notions of equality have been far less explored in the anthropological literature. Part of the reason is almost certainly as Flanagan (1989:261) suggests: that equality tends to be ʺnaturalizedʺ in the social sciences and so regarded as the proto-cultural condition out of which structures of inequality are presumed to have developed by evolutionary differentiation (cf. Fried 1967).<br>

The pluralization of worldviews and disenchantment with grand narratives, the suspicion of hasty ethnocentric generalization, and even the disciplinary specialization of inquiry itself encourage a general retreat into forms of relativism or narrow empiricism.

  Abstract: The clinical psychoanalysis model and the alternative metaphysics model escape the criticism that applies to the story model.

The reason is that neither model asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be possibly true.<br>

  Abstract: I begin with an informal statement of three different theses concerning the relation between freedom and reason. According to the first thesis, freedom is a consequence of the subordination of the intellect to independent formal structure. One finds a version of this thesis, for example, in Plato’s
                     Sophistat 253c6ff, where dialectic, or the science of the combination and separation of forms—also referred to as division in accordance with kinds—is identified by the Eleatic Stranger and the young mathematician Theaetetus as the science that characterizes the free man.<br>

  Abstract: If consciousness is always enacted behaviorally in a world and neuronal connectivity instantiates consciousness but does not necessarily explain it, there is every reason to hope that we might come to understand both self-referential consciousness and the primary sentience it reorganizes by studying their likely points of evolutionary emergence. Any attempt, however, to infer forms and levels of consciousness in the activities and sensitive attunements of organisms simpler than ourselves runs immediately into one of the most fundamental debates of modern science. The issue of animal consciousness clearly pits the basic criteria of theoretical parsimony and availability of methodological verification<br>

  Abstract: The Caribbean (historically shaped in its identity formation by Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Europe) is home to four major linguistic groups, a plurality of Afro-religious and some Indo-religious traditions, including some indigenous ones (Nettleford in Hall 2006, 6–7; Murrell 2009), and a kaleidoscope of cultures (Sunshine 1985, 7). For that reason, it is an extremely complex region (Davis 1990, 5–7). This makes writing about the rainbow-like region of the Caribbean an exceptionally difficult task.<br>

Many of these facts, moreover, have been discovered to be real; they are precise locations in Paris, or a particular brand of cigarette commonly smoked in France. Their authenticity has convinced some readers that the narrative which contains them must be a mimetic one.

  Abstract: Within the modern West we have learnt to think of the Enlightenment as a secular project which claims to think of individuals as rational selves. Where faith was positioned within pre-modern societies which were organised around tradition, we learnt within an Enlightenment vision of modernity to find reason. People were no longer expected to accept beliefs as a matter of faith but could confidently expect to have to prove their beliefs according to reason. This helped radically to redefine the relationship between public and private spheres and religious belief became a matter of individual choice alone. So it was that<br>

  Abstract: To many within academia, the notion of a “religion and science debate” seems to be the stuff of history.¹ It conjures up visions of papal courts and forbidden books, of nineteenth-century confrontations between reason and superstition in the halls of royal societies, of a world in which the value of science had yet to prove itself, even in the minds of the most learned members of society.

For that historical reason, aesthetics is not just “art theory,” as it articulates both more general and more particular issues, for instance: perception through the senses, the definition of beauty, judgment of taste, the truth content of an artwork and its relationship to (physical, psychological, economic etc.) reality, the questions of originality and newness; eventually, the definition and the very possibility of “art” itself, which becomes a serious matter<br>

For this reason it is of great importance that there are public spaces where we encounter these “others”, are confronted by them and must relate to them.

We term the resulting norms and practices ‘local conflict resolution’. The development of these ways of mediating across difference has itself sometimes been violent, yet the accompanying local conflict resolution processes are dynamic and pluralist. They are open to revision and adaptation, including to the input of outside and new forces and actors. For this reason our use of the term ‘local’ does not connote a bounded space that excludes outsiders. Rather,<br>

This is the opening statement of a work that is considered to be the genealogical moment in the creation of aesthetics as an autonomous philosophical field—a creation prompted by the need to rescue the senses from the primacy of reason.

We trace the origins of Western civilization back to the Greek “emancipation” of reason from myth.

  Book Title: Dark Writing-Geography, Performance, Design<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Carter Paul<br>
  Abstract: We do not see empty figures and outlines; we do not move in straight lines. Everywhere we are surrounded by dapple; the geometry of our embodied lives is curviform, meandering, bi-pedal. Our personal worlds are timed, inter-positional, and contingent. But nowhere in the language of cartography and design do these ordinary experiences appear. This, Dark Writing argues, is a serious omission because they are designs on the world: architects and colonizers use their lines to construct the places where we will live. But the rectilinear streets, squares, and public spaces produced in this way leave out people and the entire environmental history of their coming together. How, this book asks, can we explain the omission of bodies from maps and plans? And how can we redraw the lines maps and plans use so that the qualitative world of shadows, footprints, comings and goings, and occasions—all essential qualities of places that incubate sociality—can be registered? In short, Dark Writing asks why we represent the world as static when our experience of it is mobile. It traces this bias in Enlightenment cartography, in inductive logic, and in contemporary place design. This is the negative critique. Its positive argument is that, when we look closely at these designs on the world, we find traces of a repressed movement form. Even the ideal lines of geometrical figures turn out to contain traces of earlier passages; and there are many forms of graphic design that do engage with the dark environment that surrounds the light of reason. How can this "dark writing"—so important to reconfiguring our world as a place of meeting, of co-existence and sustaining diversity—be represented? And how, therefore, can our representations of the world embody more sensuously the mobile histories that have produced it? Dark Writing answers these questions using case studies: the exemplary case of the beginnings of the now world-famous Papunya Tula Painting Movement (Central Australia) and three h~<br>

  Abstract: The lines that the artist Paul Klee was drawing in 1906–1907 were “my most personal possession,” yet he lamented, “The trouble was that I just couldn’t make them come out. And I could not see them around me, the accord between inside and outside was so hard to achieve.”¹ As the history of coastlines showed, scientists as well as artists have found it hard to connect the ideal lines they carry around in their heads with the actual appearance of the world.

  Abstract: A fundamental mutation in the question of agency takes place between two movements, in a space that we can label the Enlightenment/post-Enlightenment divide. Literature is one of the cultural sites that embodies the consequences of this mutation. As Peter Bürger notes, there is a point at which the activity of the philosophes needs to slide from philosophical inquiry into aesthetic production to carry out the project of the autonomy of reason (1992, 8–11). Through this movement, aesthetics in general and the literary domain in particular become the site of absolute freedom in modern societies, that is, a site where<br>

  Abstract: In 1851, the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer gathered together two volumes of his scattered essays, aphorisms, dialogues, and random thoughts and published them under the recherché title
                  Parerga and Paralipomena.¹ Far more than his masterwork of 1819,The World as Will and Representation,it reached a surprisingly wide readership and made his reputation. The 1850s were, after all, a grim period of political reentrenchment following the failures of the revolutions of 1848, and the time was ripe for the sour pessimism and disillusionment with reason expressed in his philosophy of the irrational will.

  Abstract: J. A. Hobson was one of the half-dozen most influential political thinkers in late-nineteenth—early-twentieth-century Britain, a fact that even the partial revival of his fortunes has infrequently brought to light. The main reason for this oversight has two complementary facets: Hobson’s contribution lay chiefly in his formulation of a liberal version of British welfare thought, an ideological genre that until recently was accorded insufficient recognition; and, conversely, recourse to conventional modes of political theorising, utilising existing traditions, or referring to the constructs of leading individuals, was not paramount in his work. It is symptomatic that in the various reading<br>

As already briefly mentioned, during his early university days Freud explicitly rejected philosophy, because of its “speculative” character. He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science. That move heralded the series of clinical studies that would eventually emerge in the therapeutic system of psychoanalysis, a psychiatry he would consistently call a “science.” Freud never abandoned his commitment to scientific knowledge and perhaps more importantly, scientific reason.

Yet far from ensuring the freedom of the individual, Seligman argues, "the fundamentalist doctrine of enlightened reason has called into being its own nemesis" in the forms of ethnic, racial, and identity politics. Seligman counters that the modern human must recover a notion of authority that is essentially transcendent, but which extends tolerance to those of other--or no--faiths.<br>

  Abstract: Karl Morrison discusses historical writing at a turning point in European culture: the so-called Renaissance of the twelfth century. Why do texts considered at that time to be masterpieces seem now to be fragmentary and full of contradictions? Morrison maintains that the answer comes from ideas about art. Viewing histories as artifacts made according to the same aesthetic principles as paintings and theater, he shows that twelfth-century authors and audiences found unity not in what the reason read in a text but in what the imagination read into it: they prized visual over verbal imagination and employed a circular, or nuclear, spectator-centered perspective cast aside in the Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<br>

Through his extensive analysis of large volumes of correspondence as well as historical and macro-sociological mappings of the intellectual and social worlds in which the Durkheimian project emerged, the author shows the Durkheimian project to have constituted a quasi-religious quest in ways much deeper than most interpreters have thought. Their fascination, both personal and intellectual, with the sacred is the basis on which the author reconstructs some important components of modern French intellectual history, connecting Durkheimian thought to key representatives of French poststructuralism and postmodernism: Bataille, Foucault, Derrida, Baudrillard, and Deleuze.<br>

  Author(s) Margry Peter Jan<br>
  Abstract: In societies that experience catastrophic events, numerous practices are aimed at endowing those events with meaning. The contingent nature of a catastrophe and the disorder it creates are inconsistent with the human sense of reason and provoke anxiety. To overcome the anxiety and limit the disorder, societies generally seek to reestablish order by explaining the catastrophe and by evaluating it, narrating it, commemorating it, and trying to prevent its repetition. All of these processes enable people to deal actively with the disorienting event and to convert disorder into order (Balandier 1988).<br>

  Abstract: Life in certain kinds of intense moments leads us to intuitions of realms that stretch or soar beyond speech and everyday realia, but these intuitions resist definition; they cannot be captured. While acknowledging that our reason and our language must always be defeated in such attempts to attain the unobtainable, we still have the deepest desire to edge near to and at least partially glimpse them. We respond to these needs with language and the use of language that, like other aesthetic resources, can give us intimations and rough outlines of the unmanifest beyond the manifest and, even further, the<br>

  Abstract: We mentioned that the object of our investigation would be how European Union law

The latter reason will lead us to consider the toolbox concept we deploy here in order to enrich our understanding of Belgian constitutional case law relating to federalism.<br>

  Abstract: When we return from resignation to the world of society, we turn to a certain tradition of justice and injustice, though the principles by which people attempt to derive laws from claims of reason often obscure the idea that justice itself may be a tradition. But what does it mean to say that there is a tradition of modern justice? And what are its insufficiencies? Kafka’s question might not even be posed in reference to justice but only in reference to punishment, which surely must be something different, even metaphorically.

Professional reputations and careers are at stake; the old guard must hold off the challenge posed by the “Young Turks” in order to maintain their status and privilege. It is thus not surprising that new movements in legal thought have provoked heated response from a number of distinguished legal scholars.

  Abstract: Philosophers of science have a long tradition of making a connection between explanation and understanding, but only lately have they started to give the latter notion a substantial role in their theories. The reason is because understanding is an even more difficult notion than explanation. To my mind, the recent interest in understanding (exemplified by this volume), springs from the fact that explanation is a cognitive activity, and for too long theories of explanation have dismissed the cognitive dimension with the weak excuse of its being a too “subjective” ingredient for a theory of

  Abstract: Representations of war are determined not only by the ages in which they appear, but also by the boundaries understood to define war.

War is, however, an extended process, one that can hardly be isolated or made wholly distinct from peace. The vagueness of the concept suggests that much remains unknown about its limits.

As a word, the Absolute came into philosophical discourse with Schelling to mean the ontological ground of and point of identity between subject and object. In this sense Hegel adopted the term in his early works, while in his later writings he came to identify the Absolute with the process and final conclusion of reason.

It consisted of rural communes in the central Alps and urban communes at Lake Constance, the Upper Rhine and the eastern part of Burgundy.

  Abstract: ‘Desire’ is an undoubtedly slippery concept, and one that seems constantly weighed down, as it were, by metaphysical, essentialist and discursive baggage. As we saw in the last chapter, it was for this reason that Foucault felt uncomfortable with Deleuze’s use of desire, albeit subverted. A number of interpreters – Žižek chief among them – have since made this the basis of their critique of Deleuze and the micropolitics of immanence. It is essentially argued that by virtue of retaining desire as a primordial ‘micro’ essence or pre-social multiplicity, Deleuze ends up viewing power as a negative force concomitant with the macro<br>

One reason for this is the rise of interdisciplinary areas of study that have found autobiography to be a particularly useful form of writing, and so have accorded it a distinctive place in the study of both authenticity and alterity.

  Abstract: If conflict is an intrinsic feature of democratic politics, then the manifestations of this conflict should be subjected to critical analysis to assess the extent to which they lend themselves to violence. This is particularly important because modern politics – especially in pious democratic forms – tends to deal with these conflicts in ethical terms constructed on a juxtaposition between democracy and violence. For this reason, evaluation of the ethics of conflict is fundamental to the arguments for and against democracy in contemporary politics, in particular the relationship between violence and democracy.

  Abstract: Back in the early 1970s, David Hammack, a historian of New York City, told me that the most important person in the New York City Archives was an individual whose only qualification was his membership in the Teamsters Union. The reason that this was such an important qualification, Professor Hammack explained, was that the archive was seriously underfunded and underhoused.

  Abstract: By 1951, much of the leadership of the Communist Party was convinced of the inescapability of a war between the Soviet Union and the United States. For that reason, instructions were sent from the Communist Party’s national office to district organizers such as Junius Irving Scales (1920–2002), who supervised North and South Carolina, to interview each member during the annual registration. Scales’s mandate was to seek out weak links who might compromise the Party if it was outlawed and its adherents required to go underground; he was told to interrogate members about their intimate affairs but write nothing down.<br>

  Abstract: Ethical formalism has been the dominant paradigm in communication ethics. Formalist ethical systems are based on rules, principles, and doctrines that set standards for human behavior. Through reason the human species is distinctive, and through rationality moral canons are understood to be legitimate. Ethics is typically grounded in prescriptions, norms, and ideals external to society and culture. In mainstream professional ethics, an apparatus of neutral standards is constructed in terms of the major issues media practitioners face in their everyday routines.<br>

  Abstract: From Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke, to Jürgen Habermas, social theorists have long argued that political transformations rest on a foundation of reasoned public critiques. Habermas contended that widespread public debate about—and criticism of—official government policies first developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through a process of rational disputation conducted via the press. For Habermas, emotion had no part to play in this idealized political process. Instead, he applauded “the critical judgment of the public making use of its reason.” From his contemporary eighteenth-century vantage point, Bolingbroke too saw little efficacy in emotion.

  Book Title: Reclaiming the Enlightenment-Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRONNER STEPHEN ERIC<br>
  Abstract: With its championing of democracy, equality, cosmopolitanism, and reason -- and its vociferous attacks on popular prejudice, religious superstition, and arbitrary abuses of power -- the Enlightenment was once hailed as the foundation of all modern, progressive politics. But in 1947, this perspective was dramatically undermined when Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno published their classic work,
      Dialectic of Enlightenment, which claims that the Enlightenment was the source of totalitarianism and the worst excesses of modernity. Reclaiming the Enlightenment from purely philosophical and cultural interpretations, Bronner shows that its notion of political engagement keeps democracy fresh and alive by providing a practical foundation for fostering institutional accountability, opposing infringements on individual rights, instilling an enduring commitment to social reform, and building a cosmopolitan sensibility. This forceful and timely reinterpretation of the Enlightenment and its powerful influence on contemporary political life is a resounding wake-up call to critics on both the left and the right.<br>

Its method was the critical deployment of “reason” and its goal was bettering the conditions of social life and expanding “freedom.”¹ No less than the Enlightenment itself, however, the liberal heritage is both underestimated and taken for granted. Often seen merely as an ideological veil for capitalist exploitation, this new political worldview legitimated the idea of “resistance” against established authority—which was already implicit within the scientific revolution initiated by Sir Francis Bacon, Galileo, and Descartes—and it gave members of<br>

In so doing, he quoted the title of a book by Ernst Cassirer (to which he has referred on many other occasions, as well). The latter’sSubstance and Function(2003 [1910]) addresses precisely this transition from substance, which may be “heard” or “seen”(vernehmbare Substanz), to function, which admits comparison (or, alternatively, represents functional equivalence).

My reason for this will be developed on three, tightly connected registers.

Two of Foucault’s staunchest critics are philosophers who otherwise have very little in common, indeed, who had their own, quite heated and very public, debate: Jacques Derrida and Jürgen Habermas.¹ Moreover, the content of Derrida’s and Habermas’s criticisms of the early Foucault is strikingly similar; both philosophers deploy a kind of performative contradiction argument against Foucault’s critique of reason (though only Habermas uses that specific terminology).

  Abstract: The Highway of Despairfollows Theodor Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon as they each read, resist, and reconfigure a strand of thought in Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit. Confronting the twentieth-century collapse of a certain revolutionary dialectic, these thinkers struggle to revalue critical philosophy and recast Left Hegelianism within the contexts of genocidal racism, world war, and colonial domination. Each thinker also re-centers the role of passion in critique. Arguing against more recent trends in critical theory that promise an escape from despair, Marasco shows how passion frustrates the resolutions of reason and faith. Embracing the extremism of what Marx, in the spirit of Hegel, called the "ruthless critique of everything existing," she affirms the contemporary purchase of radical critical theory, resulting in a passionate approach to political thought.<br>

  Abstract: Nothing is more alien to the windless closure of high naturalism than the works of Joseph Conrad. Perhaps for that very reason, even after eighty years, his place is still unstable, undecidable, and his work unclassifiable, spilling out of high literature into light reading and romance, reclaiming great areas of diversion and distraction by the most demanding practice of style and

  Book Title: The Aesthetics of Antichrist-From Christian Drama to Christopher Marlowe<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): PARKER JOHN<br>
  Abstract: The Antichrist myth in particular tells of an impostor turned prophet: performing Christ's life, he reduces the godhead to a special effect yet in so doing foretells the real second coming. Medieval audiences, as well as Marlowe's, could evidently enjoy the constant confusion between true Christianity and its empty look-alikes for that very reason: mimetic degradation anticipated some final, as yet deferred revelation. Mere theater was a necessary prelude to redemption. The versions of the myth we find in Marlowe and earlier drama actually approximate, John Parker argues, a premodern theory of the redemptive effect of dramatic representation itself. Crossing the divide between medieval and Renaissance theater while drawing heavily on New Testament scholarship, Patristics, and research into the apocrypha,
      The Aesthetics of Antichristproposes a wholesale rereading of pre-Shakespearean drama.<br>

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology.

  Book Title: Forgotten Dreams-Revisiting Romanticism in the Cinema of Werner Herzog<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Johnson Laurie Ruth<br>
  Abstract: Werner Herzog (b. 1942) is perhaps the most famous living German filmmaker, but his films have never been read in the context of German cultural history. And while there is a surfeit of film reviews, interviews, and scholarly articles on Herzog and his work, there are very few books devoted to his films, and none addressing his entire career to date. Until now. Forgotten Dreams offers not only an analytical study of Herzog's films but also a new reading of Romanticism's impact beyond the nineteenth century. It argues that his films re-envision and help us better understand a critical stream in Romanticism, and places the films in conversation with other filmmakers, authors, and philosophers in order to illuminate that critical stream. The result is a lively reconnection with Romantic themes and convictions that have been partly forgotten in the midst of Germany's postwar rejection of much of Romantic thought, yet are still operative in German culture today. The film analyses will interest scholars of film, German Studies, and Romanticism as well as a broader public interested in Herzog's films and contemporary German cultural debates. The book will also appeal to those interested in the ongoing renegotiation - by Western and other cultures - of relationships between reason and passion, civilization and wild nature, knowledge and belief.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas.

  Abstract: The title “father of modern philosophy” (
                  modernin the sense of “not ancient”) is usually ascribed to the Frenchman René Descartes (1596–1650). By introducing mathematical methods into philosophy, Descartes founded the rationalist tradition in epistemology (the theory of knowledge and its objects), which holds that all knowledge of reality is ultimately derived from the exercise of human reason according to foundational principles independent of the senses. The rationalist position, which in Germany was taken up by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), Christian Wolff (1679–1754), and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–62), gave philosophical underpinnings to the European intellectual movement<br>

  Book Title: Ethics and Exemplary Narrative in Chaucer and Gower-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): MITCHELL J. ALLAN<br>
  Abstract: Why do medieval writers routinely make use of exemplary rhetoric? How does it work, and what are its ethical and poetical values? And if Chaucer and Gower must be seen as vigorously subverting it, then why do they persist in using it? Borrowing from recent developments in ethical criticism and theory, this book addresses such questions by reconstructing a late medieval rationale for the ethics of exemplary narrative. The author argues that Chaucer's ‘Canterbury Tales’ and Gower's ‘Confessio Amantis’ attest to the vitality of a narrative - rather than strictly normative - ethics that has roots in premodern traditions of practical reason and rhetoric. Chaucer and Gower are shown to be inheritors and respecters of an early and unexpected form of ethical pragmatism - which has profound implications for the orthodox history of ethics in the West.

  Abstract: My characterization of the ethical potentialities of exemplary rhetoric admittedly flies in the face of a commonplace critical presumption about the teleology of morals and the authoritarian nature of didactic literature. A composite sketch of the teleological account might take the following form: morality took an unfortunate turn in the Middle Ages when it assimilated itself to Church-dominated dogmatism, until moral rationalism found its feet again in the autonomous ethics of Enlightenment reason and Reformist spirituality. The assumption is that modern philosophy forever made ethics personal and appealingly complex again; and so in the vicissitudes of history, medieval morality stands<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: This latest book by France’s preeminent sociologist provides a compact presentation of his concerns, methods, and leading concepts. The book, first, engages in a sustained critique of the illusions that philosophy falls into when it ignores the historical, social, and economic conditions of its objects and its own existence. He is particularly concerned with the errors that arise from collapsing practical, embodied, everyday ways of knowing into theoretical models of knowledge, though he also criticizes forms of false universalism in morality and aesthetics, which ignore the empirical realities of differential distributions of economic and cultural capital and of access to the requisite dispositions and interests required for political and cultural participation. Second, the book provides a critique of current social‐scientific methodologies, while promoting Bourdieu’s preferred “reflexive realism,” intended to avoid both objectivism and relativism through a radical historicization of social‐scientific reason itself. Unfortunately, this section lacks the sustained, careful argumentation that philosophers of social science might wish for. Third, the last three—and strongest—chapters present Bourdieu’s leading concepts and basic social analyses: “habitus” as an agent’s embodied, affectively conditioned practical knowledge and dispositions; social space as differentiated into fields of symbolic struggle over cultural capital; the reproduction of social order through dialectical attunement between objective structures and habitus; and the symbolic violence arising from differential access to the means and sites for defining the categories and stakes of symbolic fields. The book will be an excellent introduction to Bourdieu’s fruitful thought for philosophers and social theorists.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Abstract: For Immanuel Kant, a foundational figure of liberal Protestantism, the immortality of the soul is a postulate of pure practical reason, and the resurrection of Jesus, a legend in which Saint Paul would not have believed had it not served as a morally necessary proof of a future life. From the moral point of view (to which Kant reduces religion), it is irrelevant whether the terrestrial body is necessary for personal identity in the afterlife or even whether our bodies will be resurrected. See Immanuel Kant,
            The Conflict of the Faculties(1798), trans. Mary J. Gregor (Lincoln, Nebr., 1992), where Kant formulates principles of scriptural exegesis aimed at solving the conflict between the faculties of philosophy and theology.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: The possibility of microhistory is already contained within Braudel’s global vision; see
            The Mediterranean,2d ed. (1972), 2:1243: “That is not to say that this brilliant surface is of no value to the historian, nor that historical reconstruction cannot perfectly well take this micro‐history as its starting‐point.… Benedetto Croce has argued, not without reason, that any single event—let us say the assassination of Henry IV in 1610, or to take an example outside our period the arrival in power in 1883 of the Jules Ferry government—contains in embryo the entire history of mankind.” See Edward Muir, “Introduction: Observing Trifles,” and Carlo Ginzburg and Carlo Poni, “The Name and the Game: Unequal Exchange and the Historiographic Marketplace,” inMicro

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Christof Mandry’s recent book reopens this debate about Christian ethics, explores some of the terrain of the historical debate, and then tries to press the discussion forward. Originally written as a thesis under the direction of Dietmar Mieth, himself a contributor to this debate, Mandry's book provides a solid, if somewhat schematic, account of the lines of contention even as he makes an important contribution to the discussion within the European, especially German, context by drawing on fresh resources. Thematically, the book is divided into two parts. Part 1 explores the question of theological and philosophical ethics by examining in some detail exemplary positions. Mandry explores within Roman Catholic theology both the work of Franz Böckles, whose
      Fundamentalmoral(New York: Pueblo Publishing, 1980) offered a transcendental account of the theonomous autonomy, and that of Klaus Demmers, who insists on the “effective history” of faith on reason. Mandry then examines an analogous debate among Protestants by examining, specifically, Gerhard Ebeling’s account of moral conscience and Wolfhart Pannenberg’s argument for a distinctly theological grounding of ethics. The fact that thinkers from the various sides of the Christian tradition could reach such starkly different positions while drawing on strands of their own communions is of course important to note. Throughout, Mandry’s readings are fair and insightful.<br>

Abstract: This openness to interpretation is what recontextualizes each reading in the series of readings, which is another reason why Ricoeur speaks of the text as having only semiautonomy. Great texts, such as those of Shakespeare, are open to recontextualization through new audiences and new reading encounters. The closure that is achieved in such texts is only temporary. Ricoeur argues that it is at the level of the text that we can best understand human objectification in the form of structural explanation and the hermeneutic understanding that is the counterpart of such explanation [
         42].<br>

Abstract: For the distinction between
            DarstellungandVertretung, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak,A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Toward a History of the Vanishing Present(London and Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1999), 257–64. For Spivak the pure subaltern cannot speak and represent themselves in both senses of the term, since the moment particular subalterns emerge as spokespersons for their communities—organic intellectuals in Antonio Gramsci’s sense—they cease to be subaltern (“Subaltern Talk: Interview with the Editors,” inThe Spivak Reader: Selected Works of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, ed. Donna Landry and Gerald MacLean [New York and London: Routledge, 1996], 287–92). My argument for restoring and enabling the subaltern representations of religious traditions refers to the “nonpure” subalterns who through an enormous effort have come to speak for their purely subaltern communities—such as Rigoberta Menchú for the Mayans—but whose representations, if to be heard, require a solidary political praxis of resisting the attempts to silence them and whose already silenced and forgotten testimonials call for a similar praxis of rediscovery and restoration.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 61. Tesauro mentions one eloquent case of divine expression. When in Josh. 10:12 the sun and the moon stood still over Gibeon, the literal meaning corresponds to its historical connotation. The tropological meaning is that the enemies signify the vices against reason and the planets mean the worldly goods. Therefore, man cannot defeat sin unless he uses his goods and is not used by them. The allegorical meaning is that no one can overcome the “enemy” without the beneficial influences of the sun and the moon (Jesus and the Virgin Mary). Finally, the anagogical level becomes evident if we see the enemies as the damned souls, the sun as the divinity, and the moon as the humanity of the blessed souls (ibid., 61–62).<br>

Abstract: The second reason why the concept of perspective exchange occurs so infrequently in the jargon of theology of interreligious dialogue is this: cognitive scientific research has indicated that dispositions, like the disposition for perspective exchange, which is a natural function of the brain, can be blocked out by the influence of the person’s culture.
            46This is more likely if that culture is characterized by a constant marking of boundaries between “us” and “them,” when it focuses on exclusion rather than inclusion and exhibits hegemonic tendencies, as pointed out by the cognitive scholar J.‐P. Changeux.47In my opinion it is important to inquire frankly and critically to what extent Christianity manifests these characteristics, not only in terms of what is currently regarded as exclusivism and inclusivism but since its early beginnings. At all events, this question has opened my eyes to both the religious and moral particularism in biblical books such as the law codes in the Pentateuch, Isaiah, and Psalms and revealed to what extent there is some kind of breakthrough in Paul’s letter to the Romans and the earliest texts in the synoptic Gospels on the acts of Jesus.48Meanwhile, Sunday after Sunday, all these books are read and contemplated, and for centuries they have directed religious socialization and profoundly influenced the experience, thoughts, and actions of innumerable Christian groups.49In other words, Christianity, or rather Christians, like all people, are naturally capable of perspective exchange but may be hindered from doing so by unconscious and conscious forms of religious and moral ethnocentrism that have crept into the origins, history, and culture of their tradition—at least, that is my hypothesis in this article.<br>

Abstract: It is appropriate at this point to go back and “recall” the opening reminiscences of this text. This recollection is no longer the same as the initial experience, of course; it is inflected by the thoughts that have come in between. Strictly speaking, only the statues in front of the university would correspond entirely to the notion of
         lieu de mémoireas utilized and defined by Nora. For the generations who were part of the institution‐building efforts of the young state and for whom the figures of the “pre‐Liberation period” were an important component of their immediate childhood memories, and not just textbook entries, the monument to the Brothers Georgievi (placed in 1934) used to be a veritablemilieu de mémoire.
            95To didactic historians, probably the most widely distributed breed among the species, these figures stand as symbols of genuine patriotism and selfless charity to be admired and emulated. To contemporary students, their names mean very little, and few actually know anything about their lives and other exploits. If not entirely forgotten, their huge bronze images, “like seashells on the shore from which the sea of living memory has retreated,” tease the historical memory of college students who pass by them every morning. There is nothing exceptional or unexpected in this. As Reinhart Koselleck has remarked: “Memorials, like all works of art, have a surplus potential to take on a life of their own. For this reason, the original meaning of countless memorials is no longer recognizable without recourse to inscriptions or other empirically comprehensible reference signals.”96<br>

Abstract: By the time of Thomas’s
         Summa Theologica, the distinction of poetics from ethics is fully taken for granted. In the brief sections he devotes to it, Thomas directly and explicitly follows Aristotle to argue that “art is the ‘right reason of things to be made’; whereas prudence [that is, phronesis] is the ‘right reason of things to be done.’ … Now ‘making’ and ‘doing’ differ … in that ‘making’ is an action passing into outward matter, e.g. ‘to build,’ ‘to saw,’ and so forth; whereas ‘doing’ is an action abiding in the agent, e.g. ‘to see,’ ‘to will,’ and the like.”9Again, since moral virtue is judged according to its internal habit or end, it is of an entirely different nature than art or creativity, whose goodness or worth is defined principally by the external form of its product.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur aims to make explicit the connections linking the modern notions of self with those of ancient world thinkers. This quite intriguing story begins with the chanting heroes of canonical Greek literature, who question their selves as they strive to explain the choices they have made. In so doing, says Ricoeur, these heroes recognize for themselves a sense of responsibility. The story then develops with the ethics of virtues developed by Aristotle, especially the virtue of wisdom. Following the correct rules of this virtue engages one to act as would a “wise man” under a given set of circumstances. Such a wise man directs his action under a second‐order rule about rational action—the rule of
      phronesis, of prudence. Through the exercise of his discretion, he reveals an important part of himself: his own point of view. This emergence of the moral self in action is the reason why Ricoeur wishes to trace back in Ancient Greece “the emergence of the point of view of the subject in the description of rational action” (87). To be sure, Ricoeur admits that this analysis is a retrospective reach. But it is no small feat to have been able to reach through many centuries of writing and thinking with such a clear and concise canvas.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: A genuine atmosphere of deliberation requires three principles: “The basic premise of reciprocity is that citizens owe one another justifications for the institutions, laws, and public policies that collectively bind them. … Together with reciprocity, two other principles specify the conditions of democratic deliberation. The principle of publicity requires that reason‐giving be public in order that it may be mutually justifiable. The principle of accountability specifies that officials who make decisions on behalf of other people, whether or not they are electoral constituents, should be accountable to those people” [
      34, pp. 133, 135]. Within the framework of rights (encompassing justice as fairness) and the process of deliberation according to a discourse ethical approach, librarianship can be better able to address the difficult issues it faces. The reality of pluralism necessitates both rights and deliberation. Deliberation, as a process, cannot help but be dialectical. As has been shown here, there are differing conceptions of right and good, of intellectual freedom and censorship, even of ethical theories. To at least some extent, the discussion and controversy surrounding these issues are antinomies, contradictions between statements that each has reasonable grounds. Dialectics, as a means of resolving contradictions and reconciling division, has its foundations in Hegel. Steven Smith ably summarizes the key elements of a dialectical approach:
               It is by such an approach that we, as a profession, can arrive at a fully formed practical and normative ethics. It would be fruitless to ignore the divisions and disagreements; they must be addressed dialogically. Further, the dialogue is inescapably phenomenological (as described above) in that legitimacy, which includes beliefs and voice, must be assumed by all, with regard to all. The foregoing is an attempt to further the dialogue.Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. ~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: As we have seen, there is no place for secrecy or mystery in the Platonic paradigm of responsibility. The Platonic model is a democratic model based on responsibility as universally accessible knowledge and on a demand of transparency. Returning to the memory of Europe, Derrida remarks that as long as Europe pays homage to its Platonic heritage and keeps that memory alive, it “either neglects, represses, or excludes from itself every essential possibility of secrecy and every link between responsibility and the keeping of a secret; everything that allows responsibility to be dedicated to secrecy” (
      GD,p. 34). But apart from seeking to secure the democratic demand of full transparency and generalized accountability, the fact that this heritage seeks to achieve this demand by neglecting, repressing, or excluding the possibility of secrecy clearly suggests some kind of irresponsibility that is inseparable from the demand in question. As Patočka’s analyses of the decadence of modern Europe seek to show, it takes very little for such a democratic model of responsibility and of rendering reason to become totalitarian. Indeed, the legitimate demand intrinsic to the concept of responsibility to publicly account for oneself and one’s deeds can easily turn into a means of oppression—as has amply been demonstrated under Stalinism and Zhdanovism in the former Soviet Union, but examples of which can also be found in the U.S. with its obsession with public confession; thus this conception of responsibility based on the demand for knowledge must also, to quote Derrida, “call for respecting whatever refuses a certain responsibility, for example, the responsibility to respond before any and every instituted tribunal” (OH,p. 79).16This right not to respond and to keep a secret is the necessary antidote to a conception of responsibility that, based on knowledge, can always become a tool for the benefit of the worst. But the Christian paradigm of responsibility, which rests on th~<br>

Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Abstract: Like the Book of Mormon, the JST places the knowledge of Christ and the offer of salvation prior to Jesus’s birth. Explicitly, salvation is the plan from the beginning and atonement is God’s anticipatory response to human defection. Hence, a BCE figure in the Book of Mormon will explain: “if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have … remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.”
         64What Adam and Eve originate for their progeny is not evil, but death: “by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death.”65In the JST narrative, humans are by nature separate, not evil. “The Fall” is not a fall into evil, but into alienation. Adam and Eve’s legacy is not to change human nature but, rather, to change the conditions under which that nature will be developed, that is, out of God’s presence and in a world where “God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other,” according to the Book of Mormon.66<br>

Abstract: Popper would have none of it for two reasons. Being a philosopher of science, Popper believed that history is “characterized by its interest in actual, singular, or specific events, rather than in laws or generalizations” [
      75p. 143]. For Popper, history becomes an empirical science, like other disciplines within the social sciences, because of its interest in particular acts and events. This view of history goes back to Thucydides. There is a second reason, however, for Popper’s disdain for this version of historicism. Anyone who has read his earlierThe Open Society and Its Enemiesknows that Popper sees in Plato’s essentialist analysis of the state and in Hegel’s dialectical theory of history the two foundations of twentieth‐century totalitarianism [76, vol. 1, p. 24; vol. 2, p. 193.]. Totalitarianism is the opposite of what Herder intended in his philosophical reflections on the history of mankind. Only in a free and open society could Herder’s historicism become possible for scholars to use.<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: As it happens, and for no other good reason than the parallelism, it is the divided Flora herself who appears on the arm of the last of these halved subjects in the novel's final illustration for the wedding party. There beside her is another two-faced social agent, Mr. Pancks, but one caught this time in the throes of his normalization. Half raging insurgent, half patient and mild-mannered friend, this is the character whose own eccentric surname spells out by perfect phonetic anagram that primal violence of humiliation in
         spank.Certainly with no pangs whatever, the actual retribution he exacts is to have molested his archenemy in public, assaulted and mocked him. In full view of the local populace in Bleeding Heart Yard, Pancks shears the locks of his hypocrite boss, the false patriarch Casby. Here is an act of pseudorevolutionary, and entirely local, defiance that nonetheless comes as close as the slum dwellers of the novel will ever get to that running of blood in the streets across the channel. No proletarian revolution for England, only the unrest that fuels the plot of ambition itself: a correction from within of the middle-class system.<br>

Abstract: One such case of self‐betrayal occurs in the often‐cited episode of the trees of Hudimesnil. Riding on the carriage of Mme de Villeparisis, Marcel feels an unexplainable happiness at the sight of three trees; yet, try hard as he may, he cannot find a reason to his happiness. These trees, so strangely familiar, are perhaps a memory from childhood or from a dream, or a cryptic epiphany, or just an optical impression owing to eye fatigue. They seem to be asking of Marcel that he “return them to life”; he recognizes in their “naïve and passionate gesticulations the impotent regret of a dear person who, having lost the usage of words, feels he cannot tell us what we are unable to guess.” Having failed repeatedly to identify the source of his emotion, Marcel gives up puzzling over it, and at that precise moment he feels “as if he had just lost a friend,
            died to himself, denied a dead person, or misidentified a god.” Proust,À l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleursII, 568–69; my emphasis.<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Equally important, war requires a moral justification, an argument that appeals to the public reason of conscientious persons. War is not self‐justifying, and it may not be sought in haste. For this reason, just‐war morality calls forth the civic virtue of critical self‐analysis. As Plato understood in his design of the Republic, the institution of war must be framed by a broader set of parameters, in which self‐reflection and contemplation of the Good mark the highest forms of human activity. Hence Plato’s desire to subordinate the Guardians to the Philosopher‐Kings along with the need to rank warrior‐poetry below philosophy. The purposes that war might serve must stand within a framework that is self‐reflexive and ordered to activities that do not glorify war as an end in itself. In just‐war morality, reality is not organized in conflictual terms according to which martial virtues are goods in themselves.

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This leads us to the question of the forces or agencies structuring lived reality. The moral space of contemporary life is increasingly a polycontextual field of forces, some human and some suprahuman, whether conceived religiously or not. That fact has been a reason for my work on the theme of responsibility. An ethics of responsibility, I contend, insists that human beings exist within patterns of interaction, with environments laden with values, to which they must respond and in which environments and agents reflexively shape each other. The capacity to have actions imputed or ascribed to an agent is with respect to the power to respond to environments—some of those environments are composed of other agents—that sustain but also limit action. Imputing and ascribing responsibility and so identifying agents are of course exceedingly complex processes, and I cannot explore them in this lecture. Still, responsibility is about the exercise of power in response to other powers, human and nonhuman, in which that is always and already laden with orienting goods, with values.

Abstract: This opposition between these Parisian groups is even more startling because they followed a remarkably parallel timeline. Just as

Similarly just asfilmologiecompletely changed course at the end of the 1950s,20
            Cahiers du cinémaexperienced the first of its own mutations, when its founder, André Bazin, passed away, and its key critics (Truffaut, Godard, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol) took up cameras. Yet the two groups were dedicated to completely different enterprises and so had no reason to intersect.Cahiers du cinémasaw itself at odds with several of the many film periodicals of that decade (its acrimonious relation withPositifis legendary), butLa Revue internationale de filmologiewas hardly one of these.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Prayer is, after all, enunciated when our ability to respond and reply (existentially and ethically, as well as linguistically) is most at stake and most fearfully close to failure. If prayer is the performative utterance of faith, then faith ultimately demands the enunciation of a being‐for‐God that, by definition, we are not, and hence one we struggle to articulate with the language at hand. And if the essence of the religious is “the reverence of the invisible,” then prayer is caught up in the visible order of the understanding that marks the human separation from God: “Words force us to speak metaphorically … in the language of the
         eye” (N5411, fol. 44v).52Attempts to articulate a relationship with the divine must be drawn out of human experience marked by a chasm of separation. As Coleridge comments in 1829, “I know indeed, that his ways are not our ways nor his Thoughts our Thoughts.” Yet the struggle against the limits of language must be made: “How can I love him, trust in him, call on him,but as a Man?” (N6155, emphasis mine).53Thus, while Coleridge may indeed believe that language is as potentially sacramental as the moral law or reason, we should also remember the human subject’s intrinsic distance from all three. The finitude of the human subject grounds language in the world, meaning that articulating a response to a call breaking the borders of that world can be as difficult as willing the response in the first place.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Revelation of the transcendent is always apocalyptic, but apocalypse is not limited to religious discourse: “For in poetry, language is broken open to let the previously inconceivable appear” (24). The negative capability of poetry is a creative deconstruction akin to negative theology, and this is especially true of modernist poetry that reflects on the limits of its own representation. The result is deconstructive—a breaking down of the idols of thought and speech—but also openness to what we cannot conceive or represent. The deconstructive power of literature reveals and reveils grace or gift, but Franke insists that this openness to transcendent mystery has no positive or dogmatic content. However, to deny this openness as irrational repeats the dogmatism of absolutist belief, and here Franke parts company with Habermas and insists that such openness informs reason. None of us has a privileged vantage point to confirm or deny the transcendent, and reason itself requires an openness that questions the present in pursuit of new knowledge.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: D'Holbach, in his infamous treatise,
         Système de la nature(1770), echoed and amplified many of Spinoza's monist sentiments. Since the totality of nature is “but an immense chain of causes and effects that ceaselessly follow from one to the other,” it stood to reason that the self does not possess “independent energy, an isolated cause,” or “detached action” from its fellow beings. An empirical investigation of the natural world suffices to prove that “man is in each instance of his life a passive instrument in the hands of necessity.”51Nor is the divine afforded any greater latitude of thought or movement. While it is ironic that d'Holbach chose to present nature as a speaking and seeing goddess in the final pages of his treatise, he repeatedly stressed that nature should not be regarded as a subject, divine or otherwise, despite apparent indications to the contrary: “When I say that nature produces an effect, I do not at all claim to personalize it. … We cannot call nature intelligent in the manner of some of the beings it encompasses.”52<br>

Abstract: Those “who are impressed by the civilization of the West, those who have drunk of hell; it has given them to drink together with cold water (?), and they have feared its weak and perishing abilities … but do not fear them and fear Me; if you are true believers!” [3:175] (Cook, “Suicide Attacks”). As Seidensticker (Kippenberg and Seidensticker,
               9/11 Handbook, 22) points out, “There is no allusion to a collective humiliation of Muslims, which is often considered the principal source of Islamist rage; nor is any attempt made to console the perpetrators for the killing of thousands of civilians. The explanation seems to be that both the reason and the justification were self‐evident to the addressees of the Spiritual Manual.” Notably, bin Laden’s letters provide that rationale, reproduced in part in note 12. Makiya and Mneimneh (“Manual for a ‘Raid,'” 18) suggest that the lack of situational detail may be an attempt to eliminate clues about the intended target, should the document fall into the wrong hands.<br>

Abstract: This solicitation had its effect, not only on his students at the École Normale Israélite Orientale, where his weekly
         cours rachibecame a highlight of the school's curriculum, but on many who came to ENIO on Saturdays merely to attend these lessons. Benny Lévy, most famously, turned away from secular existence and became abaal teshuvain response to Lévinas's influence.18Yet Lévinas's drive to rejuvenate Judaism did not culminate in a revival of France's Jewish community. It was more ambitious. Lévinas argued for the universal significance of the Jewish message. It was the plurivocity of the text that allowed him to claim that this message was already in the Talmud, but it was also this message that led him to offer readings of the Talmudic text that themselves reduce the text's plurivocity to a singular interpretation. In order to specify Judaism's message as one that is universally communicable Lévinas must ultimately claim one meaning as primary—the philosophical core buried beneath a multifaceted surface. The model Lévinas invokes looks much like Kant's inReligion within the Limits
            of Reason Aloneor Maimonides's in theGuide for the Perplexed, where we find a hierarchy of meaning. Philosophical meaning is cloaked by an outward mythology. Scripture's truth is not arrived at by discovering its seventy faces of meaning but in the location of the text's philosophical essence.<br>

Abstract: Taking account of these Franciscan views, we might ask whether the animal similes in Dante's poem invite us, his readers, to contemplate Coetzee's novelist's question, “Do we have something in common—reason, self-consciousness, a soul—with other animals?” (
         Elizabeth Costello, 79). Coetzee's novelist answers her own question with a theory about feelings and sympathy whereby humans have the capacity to share at times the being of another. “Sympathy,” Coetzee writes, “has everything to do with the subject and little to do with the object, the ‘another,’ as we see at once when we think of the object not as a bat (‘Can I share the being of a bat?’) but as another human being” (Elizabeth Costello, 79).<br>

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering. I took for barbarism or decadence what was in fact the supreme sophistication of an art that was completely in control of its own techniques and in search of subtle effects.

Abstract: It is utterly clear that Faustus's inner life is tortured. The longing and the sense of exile invoked by his cries (“see, see where Christ's blood streams…one drop would save my soul…ah my Christ”) are utterly palpable yet horribly answered by sharp internal pain, as if an invisible claw slashed at Faustus's heart for its very longing (“Ah, rend not my heart for naming of Christ”). And by this rending sharpness Faustus becomes all the more alienated from mercy, as if he were confronted with the hallucination of Christ's blood disappearing (“Where is it now? ’Tis gone”), or as if God himself looked down in the sternest, most unforgiving judgment (“see where God / Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!”). But what makes God seem entirely confounding is not merely that he seems to all too ready to squash Faustus, as if Marlowe's hero were nothing more than a scurrying, terrified bug, but also that Faustus himself finally seems horrified by damnation yet remains utterly exiled and bereft of any chance for his soul to find rest because he manifests the very same habit of mind he displayed in his opening soliloquy. He still feels that he can live only in his body, addressing the earth as if it could hide him from God by hiding his body (“Then will I headlong run into the earth: Earth gape! O no, it will not harbor me” [5.2.87]). He still feels like salvation is an annihilation worse than death, and for that very reason he cannot help but prefer either to be in endless pain in hell or to have no soul at all (“O no end is limited to damned souls! / Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?” [5.2.104–5]). And he still thinks that his soul is flesh and that his flesh will endure forever in hell (“Now body, turn to air, / Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell / O soul, be changed into little water drops, / And fall into the ocean, ne'er to be found” [5.2.116–19]). Thus he can do nothing but call on God in a gasping panic (“My God, My God!” he cries, just before~<br>

Abstract: Finally, it remains unclear how the explicit commitment that I compared to
      prohairesisrelates to the nonreflective level at which commitment still operates in any particular direction of action, even in “letting oneself go in a flight of passion” (64). As I suggested, it seems that the “commitment” necessarily found in spontaneous or unreflective action or omission is no more than the weak endorsement of some reason implicit in any intention, including those of wantons and unwilling addicts. Arguably then, authenticity in actions involving no explicit practical reflection would depend on their being guided by the deeper kind of commitment formed by explicit avowals, in which the more generic type of commitment is made “one’s own” in the deeper sense.<br>

Abstract: The identification of the biblical condition with gonorrhea is only provisional. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that, against some claims to the contrary (e.g., Milgrom,
         Leviticus 1–16, 907), there is no reason to deny the awareness of venereal diseases in the ancient Near East. See now Scurlock and Andersen,Diagnoses in Assyrian and Babylonian Medicine, 88–97.<br>

Abstract: Some of the earliest forms of the generic notion of evil demarcate
            abominations—acts that, like incest, cannibalism, patricide—elicit horror and disgust. Abominations are violations, disorders of nature that issue in natural sanctions: plagues or expulsions. The world in whichevilis construed as a form ofsinful disobedienceis a world defined by a divinity who gives commands, exacts obedience, punishes, or rewards (Genesis and Exodus). A world focused on virtue andviceis a naturalistic, social world (Theophrastus, Butler, Mandeville). Virtues are those traits that—like courage and justice—preserve and enhance a community. The vices—greed, disloyalty, envy, self-indulgence, disrespect—threaten the social order. The origins and sanctions for vices are social: an unfortunate upbringing in a malformed polity can issue in the kind of corruption whose sanction is the loss of trust and cooperation. Withmalevolence(Pope Innocent III, Calvin), we enter a new world, a world of individual will and responsibility. While malevolence is normally marked by a defective will,sinfuses disobedience with a defiant will (Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards). But while the earliest forms of disobedience can be relatively innocent, sin presupposes that Everyman, in the full knowledge of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, willfully violates the divine order by presumptuous pride (Milton’s Satan, Goethe’s Faust). When the disposition or proclivity to sin—construed as pride or egoism—becomes an inherently dominant and psychologically structuring motive, only divine grace can set aside divine punishment. Evil becomes less fraught when morality returns to the secular, social order during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Setting aside the theology and metaphysics of sin, the new psychology turned to characterizing character traits that—like wanton cruelty—generate “man’s inhumanity to man” (Montaigne, Voltaire).Partiality, egoism—the desire for glory or selfinterest—remai~<br>

Abstract: In the instant before his heart breaks, Lear gives us reason to believe he is sincerely answering his ordination, and our hope that this is so attests to the play’s success in impressing upon us its exacting ethical vision. The king’s attentiveness to Cordelia’s inert form, as Michael Holahan has shown, is an exquisite example of ethical perception and responsiveness.
      
            And it is true, as Maynard Mack affirms, that Lear dies with no regard for himself. He draws his last breath “with his whole being launched toward another.”45
         
            Yet this altruistic posture is undermined by several of Lear’s last lines, some of which signal delusion (“This feather stirs. She lives” [5.3.239]), others indifference (“Prithee, away” [5.3.242]), and others wrath (“A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all” [5.3.243]). The play drives toward an ideal of ethical interrelation and absolute responsibility, but how close does the king come? After all is said and done, what we have witnessed remains enigmatic. Like the irreducible other, the tragedy resists our efforts to thematize its content or comprehend its meaning.46

Abstract: In this context, Žižek’s twofold objection seems quite relevant: First, “is not the true fidelity to the Event ‘dogmatic’ in the precise sense of unconditional faith, of an attitude that does not ask for good reasons and that, for that very reason, cannot be refuted by any argumentation?”; John Milbank, Slavoj Žižek, and Creston Davis,
         Paul’s New Moment: Continental Philosophy and the Future of Christian Theology(Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2010), 90–91. And second, “is not the circular relationship between the Event and the subject (the subject serves the Event in his or her fidelity, but the Event itself is visible as such only to an already engaged subject) the very circle of ideology?” (92).<br>

Abstract: While Bradley’s discomfort in the theater may obstruct the interpretive work needed to comprehend those “tragic feelings,” his judgment artificially divorces the sense from the significance in the play’s world of pain. The horrifying, unbearable, excessive moments of bodily pain that Bradley cannot tolerate are the same events that stun Gloucester, Albany, and the other characters into their pessimistic perspectives of the world. The reaction to the physical pain portrayed on stage brings Bradley to the same stunned state as the characters. In particular, the blinding of Gloucester is a moment that, for Bradley, can only succeed for reading audiences. In the theater, “the mere physical horror of such a spectacle” overwhelms the “purely tragic emotions” with revulsion and shock. Reading, however, allows the “mere imagination [of] the physical horror” to be “so far deadened that it can do its duty as a stimulus to pity, and to that appalled dismay at the extremity of human cruelty which it is the essence of the tragedy to excite.”
      
            Bradley’s affective response exhibits the same effects of reason overwhelmed as other critics see in Gloucester and Caruth sees in victims of trauma. As horrible as scenes like his blinding may be, as much as we may want to keep that horror in check in our imaginations as Bradley does, these moments serve a vital purpose in bringing the audience to the same affective state as the characters with whom they empathize. To borrow the language of42
         Roman Actor, our “sinews shrink” when Gloucester is tortured, and we understand his pessimistic theology because the play has deliberately brought us along with him. To judge by Bradley’s reaction, it has tortured us in a way, too.

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Gutterman pairs Sunday with King, focusing on their sermons and speeches. His readings are sharp and detailed, and his solid historiography sits alongside the work of David Chappell or Clifford Putney. The chapters on PK and CTR are well written but contain misunderstandings of each group's political orientations. Gutterman briefly outlines PK's declension narrative involving the breakdown of the “nuclear family”; but this begs for further comparative work, as he does not engage the 1970s architects of this narrative (e.g. Richard Viguerie), nor does he make sufficient use of literature on gender and religion. He also mishandles some of PK's political complexities, asserting that PK “has a political vision, and proclaims a political theology” (p. 99) even as its members see “no reason for democratic politics” (p. 125). In fact, PK do not dismiss politics altogether; politics are simply seen as serving a different purpose than evangelism. In other words, the relations among oft‐used terms like “politics,” “democratic politics,” and “political theology” are at times imprecisely articulated.<br>

Date: 05 2004<br>
Author(s): Eubanks Cecil<br>
Abstract: This debate eventually focused on the nature of revelation (letters 35–39), with Strauss having written that “there is an essential distinction between the thinking of the Middle ages, based on revelation, and the thinking of classical antiquity, not based on revelation” (78). Voegelin responded that both revelation and reason are part of a universal human knowledge that is understood concretely and experientially. This prompted Strauss to write back that claims of a universal human knowledge must reside in the realm of philosophy and not in Christianity. To understand Plato properly, one should not impose “biblical concepts,” since they are separate from Greek philosophy. Although Strauss and Voegelin did not resolve this debate, it does clarify and present challenges to both thinkers' philosophies: for Voegelin, the claim that the experience of the divine is the foundation of a universal, human knowledge requires some sort of demonstration in order for him to escape what Strauss referred to as “the desert of Kierkegaard's subjectivism” (88); for Strauss, the tension between reason and revelation suggests a permanent condition of human incompleteness that is unable to point to a right way of life, leading one into nihilism.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes J. Habermas's theory of “universal pragmatics” and examines the extent to which Habermas's ideal speech community is predicted upon a specific type of relationship between the individual and society. The ability of the theory of universal pragmatics to overcome the form of domination institutionalized by modern societies is questioned, and the argument is made that Habermas's radical program of emancipation is vitiated (1) by Habermas's conflation of “transcendental” and “situationally engaged” enlightenment and (2) by Habermas's inability to reintegrate practical-emancipatory and technical forms of reason. Habermas's idea of “communicative competence” replicates, rather than displaces, the “modern” solution to the problem of the relationship between the individual and society.<br>

Abstract: Michael Ermarth summarizes the move as follows: "Particularly after his read-
ing of Husserl, he extended his notion of meaning to include the relation between the sign and the
thing signified and stipulated that what is signified cannot be resolved into experiential components
and configurations. Verstehen is not just simply the "resubjectifying of objectivations in a 'back-
ward' movement from the objective expression to the immanent subjective experiences of the
expresser, but also a 'forward movement' from the sign to its intentional object" (Wilhelm Dilthey:
The Critique of Historical Reason [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978] 274)

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010370<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Papastephanou Marianna<br>
Abstract: Rawls's recent modification of his theory of justice claims that political liberalism is free-standing and "falls under the category of the political. It works entirely within that domain and does not rely on anything outside it." In this article I pursue the metatheoretical goal of obtaining insight into the anthropological assumptions that have remained so far unacknowledged by Rawls and critics alike. My argument is that political liberalism has a dependence on comprehensive liberalism and its conception of a self-serving subjectivity that is far more binding as well as undesirable than it has been so far acknowledged. I proceed with a heuristic approach that introduces us to the possibility that political liberalism presupposes tacitly the Occidental metanarrative of reason harnessing rampant self-interest and subordinating it to a higher-order interest. As the presuppositions of political liberalism emerge, I draw from the debate between Rawls and Habermas in order to illustrate my argument for the existence of a dependence on these presuppositions. I outline some implications of the anthropological basis of political liberalism and conclude by exemplifying them with reference to Rawls's comments on the division of a cake.<br>

Author(s): Vinyard Dana<br>
Abstract: This paper provides a phenomenological account of the writing of a young woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method of interpretation is to put ourselves in the place of the author drawing upon a combination of sympathy, reason, common-sense, experience, and "an intersubjective world, common to us all" (Schutz, 1945: 536). The result is the recognition of the person as also capable of putting herself in the place of others so as to understand their behavior. This "role-taking success" identifies the limits of the current sociological understanding of insanity's significance in social interaction as an instance of "role-taking failure" (Rosenberg, 1992).<br>

Author(s): Lemel Yannick<br>
Abstract: Les théories de la modernisation proposées dans les années cinquante et soixante avançaient l'idée que les sociétés convergeaient vers les valeurs modernes et abandonnaient progressivement leurs valeurs traditionnelles. Cette idée de convergence est réexaminée dans cet article, dans le contexte des seules sociétés européennes, à partir de l'exploitation des enquêtes Valeurs. Une série d'échelles d'attitudes sont construites, puis analysées par des techniques multivariées. Deux résultats principaux se dégagent de cette étude. Tout d'abord, il apparaît que, quelle que soit la date ou les pays examinés, les valeurs des Européens se structurent toujours autour d'un axe de traditionalisme. Un tel résultat est évidemment en contradiction avec les thèses, fortement critiquées par ailleurs, de convergence vers la modernité. Ce résultat est aussi l'occasion de réfléchir sur le pendant du traditionalisme -- faut-il l'appeler "modernité"? -- et sur les liens entre les attitudes économiques et les attitudes morales. En second lieu, la religiosité est étroitement liée à cette structuration des valeurs, mais elle oppose principalement les Européens affiliés à une religion quelle qu'elle soit aux sans-religion, plutôt que -- comme on l'imagine souvent -- les catholiques aux protestants. Au total, la tension entre tradition et modernité reste au cœur du système de valeurs des sociétés européennes. /// The modernization theories developed in the 1950s and 60s put forward the idea that societies were converging toward modern values and gradually abandoning their traditional values. Using data from the Values surveys, the article reexamines the convergence idea in the context of European societies. A set of attitude scales was constructed, then analyzed using multivariate techniques. Analysis yielded two main results. First, regardless of date or country examined, Europeans' values seem still to be structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously runs counter to converge~<br>

Abstract: Il recente articolo di S. Scullion, 'Nothing to Do with Dionysus': Tragedy misconceived
as Ritual', Class. Quart. 52, 2002, pp. 102-137, si situa al polo opposto dell'approccio descritto
sopra. Lo studioso non solo nega radicalmente ogni legame tra religione e tragedia, ma
respinge ogni testimonianza su tragedia e culto dionisiaco come non probante (da Platone
fino ad Aristotele) con argomentazioni che in ultima analisi dipendono da una valutazione
tanto scettica quanto idiosincratica della fonte. La non religiosità della tragedia viene affer-
mata in nome della progressiva "secolarizzazione" della poesia greca (su questo concetto
vedi infra) e, secondo lo studioso, "in the dramatic component of the Athenian dramatic
festivals the specific cultic context of the festival was largely irrelevant, the general civic
context, including all manner of religious issues and cultic and ritual themes and motifs,
centrally relevant" (p. 135). Non includerei questo contributo in nessuno dei due filoni sopra
indicati: il contributo di Scullion si risolve piuttosto in uno scetticismo integrale (almeno
ogni volta che sia in gioco la religiosità della tragedia) e rinunciatario. La conclusione di
Scullion è infatti che la tragedia fu connessa a Dioniso per una "very simple reason", cioè
che nel momento in cui si presentò la necessita di costruire un teatro "the best location
(...) was the south-east slope of the Acropolis, in the sanctuary of Dionysus Eleuthereus.
(...) It followed naturally that the dramatic contest should be instituted at a festival of the
god of the sanctuary" (p. 135 s.). L'associazione tra dionisiaco e tragico non sarebbe dunque
che il frutto di una coincidenza storica fortuita e awentizia (e pertanto non significativa);
l'osservazione che "This may seem a banal conclusion, but on the evidence it is at least as
likely as any other" (p. 136) è in qualche modo scoraggiante.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; ~<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: The article identifies a paradox in the concept of person and in its use. Modernity, and the liberation from the logic of status, should have brought about the ultimate consolidation of the idea of personal value. On the contrary it caused such a drastic functional differentiation within society that the individual has come to be defined by his/her function (citizen, economic actor, etc.) rather than as the single bearer of different roles. The concept of person has thus become an expression to identify only the communicative aspect of social life. That is the reason why in our complex society the concept of person cannot find a proper location and comes to the fore only when the other codes fail.<br>

Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Abstract: The use of Reason may take two different meanigns: the way of the rational and the way of the reasonable. The first one consists in computing from quantitative evaluations, the second one to deliberate from arguments pro and con. The first one is the way of Mathematics, as to the second, it is more traditionally the way of Politics and Law. All the societies have used the second to solve their social problems. The West only has used the first in the field of human relations. Consequently, we have a devaluation has endured the same destiny. The consequence of that alteration has been very spectacular. The West has got an incredible power. However, to-day, that tremendous efficiency faces limits of all kinds.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I consider the rival liberal and communitarian accounts of justice emerging in complex, pluralist societies. I argue that we err in posing the question of human rights as a Hobson's choice between a formal, universal metanarrative, as envisioned in philosophical liberalism, or as a merely local, ethnocentric narrative of the western bourgeoisie, as in the communitarian critique. For human rights are best viewed rhetorically, as establishing the possibility of rationally persuasive argument across our varied narrative traditions. The essay concludes by attending to the role of religious belief in the public reason of a postmodern society.<br>

Abstract: The author studies systematically the internal criteria which he considers most valid, in so far as they are critically established, for providing access through the gospels to Jesus and for guaranteeing the historical authenticity of his life and message. After placing the problem of establishing valid criteria (la critériologie) in the context of the current critical study of the gospels and offering a number of critical observations designed to avoid confusions (especially the distinction between pure data, criteria and proof; between literary and historical criteria; between criteria and the intellectual attitudes that thereby follow), the author presents and discusses seven criteria which he groups under three headings: basic criteria (critères fondamentaux), dependent criteria (critères dérivés), and composite criteria (critères mixtes). Among the basic criteria he discusses: 1. the criterion of multiple testimony, together with the principal objection which can be raised against it, i.e. the extent to which one can speak of independent sources with regard to the gospels since all derive from oral tradition; 2. the criterion of discontinuity, considered on the levels of form and content; 3. the criterion of conformity (or of continuity or coherence), including the different formulations which contemporary exegetes propose, as well as its connections with the criterion of discontinuity; 4. the criterion of required explanation (explication nécessaire) or of sufficient reason for a group of convergent and well-attested facts. As an example of a dependent criterion called such since it is established in relation to the basic criteria, the author proposes the living, personal style of Jesus as distinguished from the gospels' literary style. Finally, among the composite criteria, that is to say the cases where an important literary characteristic is linked with one or several historical criteria, he mentions: the internal intelligibility of an account or of a group~<br>

Abstract: This Study is divided in three parts. The first treats the problem of the relation between Scripture and reason considered as Springs of Moral Theology. Why a recourse to Bible should be necessary if conscience is already a Spring of moral knowledge? What kind of Priority has, for christian conscience, the Authority of the Gospel? The answer is that the light of the Gospel and the light of Reason are not two independant possibilities: there is interaction and complementarity between them: both Scripture and human Reason can be said to be, together, the soul of Moral Theology. The second part is about Hermeneutics. How can we apply the written Gospel to every day's reality? Exegesis tells me what the biblical text is saying: the text speaks. Hermeneutics tells me what the biblical text is saying to the modern man: the text speaks today. Hermeneutics try to liberate the actual meaning of the biblical text. In the third Part, the dialectic between faith and reason is applied to the moral of S. Paul. What was Paul's Filter in front of hellenism? How did he manage to borrow some principles of morality from the current morality and to refuse some others? What was his originality? How did he use Faith and Reason in building up his moral doctrine?<br>

Abstract: Freud's metapsychology, although it is not identical with the whole field of psychoanalytic psychology, originated under the controlling influence of a questionable positivistic model of science. The analysis begun in a previous study (Gregorianum, 61 [1980] 97-136) continues in this study of the relationship in Freud's thought between theory and empirical observation. We also treat the attempts by Freud and by the later neopositivist schools of classical ego-theory to articulate psychoanalytic insights about the person in terms taken from neurophysiology, biology, and classical mechanics. Such terms pervade the terminology used to express the metapsychological viewpoints, albeit in disharmonious juxtaposition with more specifically psychological terms. Freud's whole work was affected by his desire to propose psychoanalysis as a natural science on the model of the positivistic outlook of late nineteenth century Viennese physicalism. Opposition arose in the 1950s and 1960s to understanding psychoanalysis as a natural science, especially because of problems of conceptual definition, language, and verification or validation. Orthodox Freudians themselves were troubled by the problem of psychic energy and the discussion finally led to critical doubts about Freud's whole metapsychology. One reason was the dependence on a physical and mechanical model of science and on a neurophysiology no longer tenable. Other frames of reference in the exact sciences were sought, such as cybernetics and information theory, in an attempt to remain to some extent in harmony with the original epistemological ideology. There are those today who remain convinced that psychoanalysis is an exact science, and who in turn reject the different psychologies of understanding and the hermeneutical sciences. In the context of a basic-level discussion, this contribution explores, in their context, the principles of the worldview found at the most theoretical level of metapsychology. Among these, the p~<br>

Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Abstract: Il est souvent refusé à la philosophie de tenir un discours d'affirmation de Dieu. Face à des objections d'hier et d'aujourd'hui aussi diverses que contradictoires, on veut montrer ici la légitimité d'un tel discours. Celui-ci suppose une double rupture: rupture avec une conception minimal ou formaliste de la raison qui refuse de se prononcer sur le principe de la vie; rupture avec une métaphysique intemporelle qui manque le nécessaire enracinement anthropologique de la question de Dieu. Philosophy is often denied discourse regarding the affirmation of God. Confronting the diverse and contradictory objections of the past and today, an attempt is made to show the legitimacy of such discourse. It supposes a double rupture: with the minimal or formalist conception of reason that refuses to pronounce on the principle of life; and with an untemporal metaphysic that lacks the necessary anthropological roots in the question of God.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo consiste numa análise da noção zubiriana de mentalidade. Começa por descrever a razão como busca para descobrir a estrutura da realidade. Esta busca requer um método que inclua um sistema de referência, que é o seu ponto de partida no sentido de sugerir hipóteses e teorias que expliquem a realidade. O sistema de referência deriva da transformação do campo de realidade. Esta transformação, que não segue uma via única, depende da "mentalidade" dos que procuram a realidade profunda. Em Zubiri, o conceito de "mentalidade" é polissémico. Existe uma "mentalidade estrutural e intrínseca", uma "mentalidade situacional extrínseca" e um "horizonte mental". Neste artigo estudam-se as três mentalidades e a sua relevância na constituição do sistema de referência e na elaboração de hipóteses e teorias. Finalmente, o artigo analisa a relevância destas mentalidades para compreender os contributos da investigação interdisciplinar e os seus desafios. The following paper is an analysis of Zubiri's notion of mentality. It starts by describing reason as a quest to uncover the structure of reality. This quest requires a method that includes a system of reference, which is its point of departure in the sense of suggesting hypotheses and theories that explain reality. The system of reference results from a transformation of the field of reality. This transformation, which does not follow a unique path, depends on the "mentality" of those who seek to deepen reality. In Zubiri the concept "mentality" is polysemic. There is a "structural and intrinsic mentality", an "extrinsic situational mentality" and a "mental horizon". The three of them and their relevance in the constitution of the system of reference and the elaboration of hypotheses and theories are studied. Finally the paper analyzes the relevance of these mentalities to understand the contributions of interdisciplinary research and its challenges.<br>

Abstract: Centrée sur l'élaboration d'un système de la religion à partir des sources du judaïsme, la dernière pensée de Hermann Cohen repose sur le concept de fils de Noé. Avec lui, Cohen réfute la thèse de Spinoza sur la nature politique de la loi juive, montrant que non seulement elle préserve la pureté du monothéisme, mais pose les fondements du droit naturel moderne. Articulant après Maïmonide les notions d'étranger, de résident et de fils de Noé, la Religion de la raison construit un lien systématique entre les concept d'autrui et d'humanité universelle. Elle ouvre ainsi l'espace où s'inscriront de manières différentes Franz Rosenzweig, Leo Strauss ou Emmanuel Lévinas. Focused on the drawing up of a system of religion by the sources of judaism, Cohen's last philosophy is based on the concept of the Sons of Noah. With it, he disproves Spinoza's thesis about Jewish law's political nature. He shows that not only this law preserves the purity of monotheism, but also gives the foundation for modern natural right. Because Cohen, after Maimonides, builts an articulation between the notions of the stranger, the resident alien and the sons of Noah, Religion of the Reason promotes a systematic link between the concepts of the other man and the universal hunanity. It opens the way for the philosophy of Rosenzweig, Strauss, or Levinas.<br>

Abstract: Le lien entre pensée philosophique et pensée juive chez Hermann Cohen se confond avec son concept de raison ou de rationalité. Dès ses premiers travaux, il s'attache à éprouver la dimension universaliste de la tradition juive. Or la rationalit/e du judaïsme réside, selon lui, dans l'idée d'une morale universelle, qui se manifeste avant tout dans la pensée messianique. Ce lien apparaît le plus clairement dans les écrits qui font converger le judaïsme et la philosophie kantienne dans l'horizon de la raison. Sous l'aspect de la philosophie pratique, cette convergence rejoint le projet politique de l'assimilation du judaïsme et de la culture allemande. The link between philosophical reflexion an Jewish thought in Hermann Cohen is thoroughly determined by his concept of reason or rationality. Since his earlier works Cohen tries to show the universalistic dimension of Jewish tradition. Now the rationality of Judaism lies in its universal morality, which is inherent to the perspective of messianism. This appears clearly in those works where Cohen brings together Judaism and Kantian philosophy with regard to the idea of reason. In the field of practical philosophy such a convergency is part of the political project of assimilation between Judaism and German culture.<br>

Author(s): Dédeyan Daniel<br>
Abstract: Departing from the disconcerting tact that the only passage where Kant mentions court practice is in a chapter on art, the essay undertakes a reconstruction of Kant's esthetics. As to beauty, the judgment of taste appears as a judgment on the ability to judge, and it is universally valid not because it is true, but because it is communicable. Kant's notion of art turns out to be the autonomous discourse of taste as his notion of morality stands for autonomy of man and his notion of law for autonomy of civil society. However, Kant's esthetical experience of the sublime as appearance of what neither mind nor senses grasp breaks up harmony and autonomy and unjudges judgment. At this point, the essay uncovers an intrinsically destabilizing force of Kant's ‚reason‘, traces the consequences for the judicial judgment and gives a perspective to philosophy of law within a differentiated society.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: Language and judicial activities are both signs of the existence of a society. There is, therefore, good reason for a dialogue between the science of language and the science of law. This article applies a linguistic theory of the Paris School (semiotics) to the examination of a legal text, namely a contract. The author points to some elements shared by legal and other texts, and demonstrates how a semiotic interpretation can provide interesting and unexpected insights into the deeper levels of a legal text. He concludes that a similar approach could fruitfully be used with other types of legal text.<br>

Abstract: Our objective in this article is to demonstrate why between 1901 and 1922 reformism in Italy remained a minority position among the members of the left-wing parties without which it failed to gain influence among the ruling classes. After explaining why we chose to study this particular period, we first show how the republican and socialist reformists were both criticized in their respective parties and bitterly fought by the liberals in power. In addition to these external difficulties, there were internal ones: the progressive positivist culture which characterized the ideology of Italian reformists was also shared by a part of the middle-classes. Especially after 1900 it became unable to appeal to the masses and to young people who were more and more fascinated by a dramatic and violent conception of history which was in contradiction with the reformist intellectuals'vision of the world. Finally, Italian reformism did not manage to fit in with the revisionist trend that was led in Europe by E. Bernstein. The third reason for the failure of this movement lies in the organizational weakness of the political reformist groups, which is to be understood through the study of the conflictual relationships between the P.S.I. and P.R.I. and their respective parliamentary groups. Revolutionary or reactionary logics prevailed over the strategies of emancipation of the people through democratic means. The failure of democratic reformism in Italy between the liberal watershed and fascism also constitutes the failure to implant a democratic political culture in this country.<br>

Abstract: Ulanov, p. 46: "'Archetype' is a symbolic concept. It conceptualizes our experience, but it is
not a mere nominalistic designation. It has the symbolic function to mediate to consciousness the
objective reality of the psyche that is not directly accessible to our sensory perception or to our
logical reason. Archetypes symbolize the life of the nonindividual psyche that we all experience
but which is not our personal possession. We feel the drive effect of the archetype, its emotional
patterns and images, but we do not experience the archetype per se because 'an archetypal
content expresses itself, first and foremost, in metaphors'".<br>

Abstract: Currently, epistemological debates on the formation of concepts in the field of history are close to nonexistent. For that reason alone, this book written by philosopher of history Doris Gerber - with which she earned her habilitation degree at the University of Tübingen - is a welcome addition to the literature in the field. In this work, Gerber addresses the metaphysical question of what "history" really is. In this study, she considers approaches typically adopted within the field of history, and questions whether the intention to act is essential in writing history, or whether it is even required in the first place. The findings of the four reviewers that follow are diverse in their opinion of this provocative study.<br>

Author(s): Schärtl Thomas<br>
Abstract: Post-liberal theology is a child of modernity and post-modernity inasmuch as it looks at human rationality with a general hermeneutic of suspicion. As a consequence, such a theology can answer questions about the reason for and the reasonableness of faith only with statements borrowed from fideism. However, if faith wants to bridge the gap between a merely negative philosophy and a positive theology, it needs to argue from universally understandable standards of reason with the concept of revelation. Precisely here is the place for the classic Fundamental-theologie. This study shows what a foundational theology can and must learn from post-liberal theories, but also in which way it must be different.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Author(s): Welsen Peter<br>
Abstract: The „petite éthique“ which Ricœur develops in Soi-même comme un autre is distinctive in its way of paying attention to the individual, the other and the society all at the same time. For this very reason the problem of the distribution of social goods is fundamental. Ricœur tries to solve this problem through a synthesis of teleological and deontological considerations, and here the approach of Rawls occupies a central place. On the one hand, the attempt to solve this problem in the framework of a teleological approach draws on principles of justice which Rawls establishes through formal procedure; on the other hand, Rawls‘ position depends on a number of teleological presuppositions which are not compatible with his deontological approach. Ricœur does not only attempt to refute Rawls, but to interpret his principles of justice as the result of a rationalisation of a sense of justice which is simply presupposed.<br>

Abstract: La Modernidad parecía condenar a la expulsión de la religión respecto del proyecto ilustrado al considerar que fe y razón eran excluyentes. No obstante, esa promesa de futuro de emancipación y de racionalidad ilustrada ha incurrido en sus propios aspectos negativos, hasta llegar, en la postmodernidad, a la deconstrucción de todo y la pérdida de sentido. El filósofo Habermas y el teólogo Ratzinger, después Papa Benedicto XVI, debatieron el papel que razón y fe debían desempeñar en las actuales sociedades plurales. Ambos partían de premisas distintas –Habermas desde la confianza en la Ilustración y en la religión como humanismo y Ratzinger desde el necesario entendimiento entre fe y razón– para llegar a un punto de encuentro: la necesidad de defender una nueva Ilustración, compatible con la religión, para operar en la postmodernidad. Modernity seemed to replace religion with the Enlightenment project, since it considered that reason and faith were mutually exclusive. However, the promise of a future of emancipation and Enlightenment reason has finally culminated, in Postmodernity, in the destruction of everything and the loss of meaning. Habermas, philosopher, and Ratzinger, theologian and later Pope Benedict XVI, discussed the role that ought to be played by reason and faith in the current plural societies. They were based on different premises—Habermas on trust in the Enlightenment and in religion from a humanistic perspective and Ratzinger on the necessary understanding between faith and reason—and reached a common point: the need to defend a new Enlightenment, compatible with religion, which can operate in Postmodernity.<br>

Author(s): KNIGHT DEBORAH<br>
Abstract: Intentional, 'commonsense,' or 'folk' psychology is, as Jerry Fodor has remarked, ubiquitous. Explanations of what we say and do in terms of our reasons for acting are the stock in trade of intentional psychology. But there is a question whether explanations in terms of reasons are properly explanatory. Donald Davidson and Daniel Dennett, to name two, have defended intentional psychology and its reason-explanations. Still, many philosophers — including Fodor, Davidson and Dennett — fail to pay due attention to the narrative basis of such agent-centered accounts of action. In this paper, I argue that psychological explanation is an agent-centered, narrative-based interpretive practice. To make my case, I present a poetics of psychological explanation: seven elements which collectively describe what makes psychological explanations work. Narrative form allows us to represent the temporal arc of agents' actions — as well as the temporal arc of their reasoning about their actions, both prospective and retrospective. It allows us to negotiate between the canonical and the exceptional in human experience, and thus to account for actions that strike us as puzzling or unusual — whether the puzzle originates in our suboptimal understanding or the agent's suboptimal reasoning. And it allows us to juxtapose different perspectives on any action. Such juxtapositioning gives us a mechanism for coming to see how an action that strikes us as misguided might have been construed by the agent as reasonable given her understanding of her circumstances. After establishing the seven elements of the poetics, I address the objection that narrative-based accounts of intentional action are not properly explanatory.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i24439205<br>
Date: 7 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): BEGGS DONALD<br>
Abstract: The theory and practice of ecological reason have consistently suffered various shortcomings, versions of anthropocentrism and holism prominent among them. Even definitions of ecological reason that rely on philosophically informed policy studies and that explicitly take the functional and substantive moments of reason into account have not escaped these problems. An account of interdisciplinarity can shed light on how these intractable problems arise, since many of them fail to build interdisciplinarity as such sufficiently into the definition of ecological reason. Genuine interdisciplinarity, distinguished from both multidisciplinarity and metadisciplinarity, can thus be seen to be necessary (not sufficient) to liberate ecological reason and to illuminate its theory and practice for late moderns.<br>

Abstract: Although Ricoeur and Taylor are often grouped together, their conceptions of language, literature, and practical reason are very different. The first half of this essay focuses on Ricoeur's theory of triple mimesis and narrative, showing how his attempt to synthesize Kant, Husserl, and structuralism results in a formalism that blocks out the ontological, hermeneutical, and historical dimensions of literature and practical reason. The second half of the essay develops Taylor's ontological conception of public imagination and illustrates the dynamics of this conception of language and interpretation by showing how literary works debate with each other over language, subjectivity, and reference. Narrative does not just order; it argues.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>

Date: 4 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): LOOBUYCK PATRICK<br>
Abstract: In the first half of the twentieth century noncognitivism was the predominant metaethical point of view in analytical philosophy. This perspective came under critical scrutiny as early as the late 1950s, and by the 1970s its authority began to be undermined. For various reasons cognitivist theories began to be put forward with confidence. Different philosophers tried ways to restore the role of reason in ethics. This shift in the philosophical climate was influenced by—or was at least in accordance with—the thought of the later Wittgenstein. In particular, this article will consider the relevance of Wittgenstein for cognitivist views, such as that of S. Toulmin, relativists like G. Harman, and British moral realists like S. Lovibond and J. McDowell. In fact, Wittgenstein is one of the founding fathers of antifoundationalism. He gives us the hopeful insight that the end of foundationalism does not necessarily imply the end of moral philosophy but must be considered a new start of it.<br>

Abstract: Having a voice, either at the level of the individual or the community, has been one of the atavistic ways of defining or asserting humanity. This allows for the inscription of the twin-capped hegemony of successes or victories and frustrations at both the private locus and the public sphere. The disruptions of this possibility by rifts between natives in pre-colonial South Africa were aggravated in the heat of the colonial suppression it suffered, and was compounded by the operation of apartheid rule. By reason of this misrule, voices were suppressed, with a few cacophonies of dissention breaking forth. The culmination of these disenchantments into the demise of apartheid significantly presaged the need for reconstruction and redefinition of citizenship and cohabitation, and hence the necessity for establishing a public sphere, or put alternatively, a public domain in the form of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This paper, therefore, seeks to interrogate the dramatic world(s) created using the material properties of the TRC in John Kani's Nothing but the Truth and Zakes Mda's The Bells of Amersfoort. The paper argues that the domination and manipulation of this public realm by the state at the expense of the individual is not only counterproductive, but constitutes a denial of the relevance of such spheres. The paper, going by indices in the plays, therefore, concludes that every individual should not only be: given a voice, and be heard, but be allowed equal unbiased participation. Otherwise, the public sphere would not just be impotent, but the idea of nation-building and desirable citizenship would be a mere ruse. Avoir une voix, que ce soit au niveau individuel ou communautaire, a été l'un des moyens ataviques de définition et d'affirmation de l'humanité. Cela tient compte de l'inscription de l'hégémonie à double face des succés ou victoires et des frustrations tant au niveau de l'espace privé que de la sphère publique. Les pa~<br>

Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i24672910<br>

Author(s): Mazurel Hervé<br>
Abstract: L'histoire des sensibilités suscite encore une méfiance persistante, avant tout parce que son projet intellectuel demeure mal identifié, parce que l'historiographie a souvent laissé penser que ses origines s'ancraient uniquement dans la continuité du projet de Lucien Febvre et de l'histoire des mentalités à la française. Or, en vérité, celle-ci n'est autre que la traduction historiographique d'un mouvement philosophique beaucoup plus ample et ancien, né du basculement incarné par Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche et Sigmund Freud, ces penseurs du soupçon, qui nous ont appris à repérer derrière les idées, la raison et la conscience, le rôle des désirs et des appétits, le jeu des pulsions et des sentiments. Rendant ainsi l'homme moins transparent à luimême, l'historien du sensible vise, outre à restituer l'historicité de notre vie sensible, à réévaluer la part des affects dans la détermination des conduites humaines. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie également sur la riche nébuleuse des savoirs critiques élaborés ensuite, dans l'Allemagne de la première moitié du 20e siècle, sous les appellations de « psychologie sociale » ou « historique » ou, à la manière nietzschéenne, de « psychologie des profondeurs ». The history of sensibility still continues to elicit suspicion, first and foremost because this intellectual project remains poorly defined, historiography often having led us to believe that its roots stemmed solely from Lucien Febvre's endeavours and the French history of mentalities. And yet in truth, the history of sensibility is nothing less than the historiographical translation of a much broader and older philosophical movement, born of the tipping point provoked by Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Those great sceptical thinkers taught us to unmask the role of desires, appetites and impulses behind our ideas, reason and consciousness. In addition to recreating the historicity of our lives of sensibility and thus rendering man less transparent to himse~<br>

Abstract: Although Dooyeweerd says that "all human acts have their origin in the soul," and
therefore beyond time, he holds that they function only within the temporal structure of the
human body (TM, XX; cf XIV). For this reason he opposes the phenomenology of Husserl and
Scheler, which regards acts as "incorporeal (onlichamelijk), (pure 'psychonomic') intentional
experiences" (TM, XV).<br>

Abstract: Other thinkers have also been instrumental in re-inteφreting philosophy as a way of re-

Paul Ricoeur, Charles Taylor and Alasdair Maclntyre - Spren Kierkegaard (1844, 1845, 1848)
with his analysis of human freedom as entangled in itself and liberated by the 'jump' into faith;
Heidegger (1927) with his analysis of anxiety as openness for the possibility of one's (own) im-
possibility; Levinas (1974) with his notion of the Other as a disquieting openness or wound in
my existence, Ricoeur (1990) with his four-fold analysis of the self as a relatedness to oneself
opened-up by the presence of the other, Taylor (1989) with his notion of disengaged reason
and of the intrinsic relation of persons to (their) 'goods', Maclntyre (1981) with his concept of
'goods' internai to practices.<br>

favor of an archeology that makes us porous again to the (divine) at work in the most intimate

somehow want to construct the good out of a movement to the end — while the beginning is a
merely indeterminate lack."<br>

Abstract: Dooyeweerd does indeed speak of actual transcending of cosmic time. In the well-known
note in NC I, 31-32, in reaction to the Divergentierapport I' written by Vollenhoven and
circulating among board members of the Association for Calvinistic Philosophy, he writes:
" (...) Some seek the concentration-point of human existence in time and suppose, that this
religious centre must certainly be pre-functional but not supra-temporal. But, at least within
the horizon of cosmic time we have no single experience of something 'pre-functional', i.e.
of anything that would transcend the modal diversity of the aspects. We gain this
experience only in the religious concentration of the radix of our existence upon the
absolute Origin. In this concentration we transcend cosmic time. How could man direct
himself toward eternal things, if eternity were not 'set in his heart'? Even the idolatrous
absolutizing of the temporal cannot be explained from the temporal horizon of human
existence. For the latter nowhere provides a point of contact for an idea of the absolute,
unless it be related apriori to the supra-temporal. This act of concentration presupposes a
supra-temporal starting-point in our consciousness.
This, however, is not to say that the religious centre of human existence is found in a rigid
and static immobility. That is a metaphysical-Greek idea of supra-temporality."
Reading this passage we should realize that Dooyeweerd's notion of time refers to cosmic time,
which is related to modal diversity (and coherence) rather than transience. This is the reason
why Dooyeweerd cannot but say that the unity of existence can only be grasped by
transcending temporal diversity. So, we can conclude that the difference between Dooyeweerd
and Vollenhoven with respect to the supra-temporality of the heart depends on different views
on time and the cosmic time order. Vollenhoven's rejection of the notion of cosmic time order
and his exclusion of numerical and spatial modal qualifications fr~<br>

Abstract: La métaphore kantienne du « grand jeu de la vie », dont nous sommes tous partie prenante en tant que nous sommes citoyens du monde, obligés d'affronter les quatre questions fondamentales : « Que puis-je savoir? Que dois-je faire? Que m'est-il permis d'espérer? » et : « Qu'est-ce que l'homme? » qui, d'après Kant, récapitulent les grands intérêts de la raison humaine dans une optique cosmopolitique, cette métaphore nous offre un excellent fil conducteur pour analyser les rapports complexes entre religion et raison philosophique. Contrairement à ce que prétend la vulgate contemporaine, nous n'avons pas encore fini d'explorer la « fonction méta » en ses quatre dimensions essentielles de la « trans-ascendance », de la « trans-descendance », de la « trans-passibilité » et de la « trans-possibilité » qui, même si elles trouvent une expression différente dans le champ religieux et dans le champ de la réflexion philosophique, donnent infiniment à penser à la religion comme à la philosophie. Kant's metaphor of the "big game of life", to which all humans partake insofar as they are citizens of the world confronted with the four fundamental questions: "What can I know?, What ought I do?, What may I hope for?" and, last but not least: "What is man?", which according to Kant summarize the major interests of Human reason in a cosmo-political perspective, offers an excellent thread for analyzing the complex relationships between Religion and Philosophy. As opposed to what many contemporary thinkers pretend, we have not yet finished pondering the "metafunction" in its fourfold dimensions: "trans-ascendance", "transdescendance", "trans-passibility" and "trans-possibility" which, although they find a different expressions in the religious field and in the field of philosophical thought, invites to rethink both religion and philosophy.

Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Author(s): Sneddon Andrew<br>
Abstract: Concerns about advertising take one of two forms. Some people are worried that advertising threatens autonomous choice. Others are worried not about autonomy but about the values spread by advertising as a powerful institution. I suggest that this bifurcation stems from misunderstanding autonomy. When one turns from autonomous choice to autonomy of persons, or what is often glossed as self-rule, then one has reason to think that advertising poses a moral problem of a sort so far unrecognized. I diagnose this problem using Charles Taylor's work on "strong evaluation". This problem turns out to have political ramifications that have been only dimly recognized in business ethics circles.<br>

Abstract: In this semiotic analysis of the Spanish auto defe, we begin to understand for the first time the meaning of religious rituals that have appeared completely incomprehensible in traditional accounts. The morning processions of penitents through city streets, the formal denunciations of heretics on public scaffolds, and the final burning at the stake of unrepentant sinners are placed within the context of medieval penitential practices and eschatological beliefs. The ceremony of the auto defe unveiled in time the Judgment Day awaiting all humankind at the end of time. For this reason, the spectacle aroused the interest of spectators all over Christendom, filling them with apprehension of their own final judgment.<br>

Abstract: Regido por la subjetividad, el universo contemporáneo del creer es en todas sus partes de circulación fluida, inmediatamente refractario a cualquier referencia estructurante a estabilidad alguna, excepto cuando postula esta estabilidad como puramente operatoria. El objetivo del creer contemporáneo no consiste en alcanzar una "identidad religiosa" (que se concibe como "estable"), sino demostrar que puede ser un creer dentro del movimiento. En realidad, el concepto de "religión", como también los de "secularización" y de "laicidad" que se le asocian, pasan a ser, en situación de plena legitimidad social de la individualización radical de la construcción de una relación con el sentido, conceptos cada vez más indeterminados y en consecuencia de sobra inutilizables, al menos mientras se persista en reconocerles una pertinencia que les sería propia. La "religión", por ello, no es sino el indicador de recomposiciones más amplias, en las cuales participa, por otra parte, como instrumento de gestión. Así, sólo tiene sentido como objeto de intermediación, un analizador que, contextualizado, puede por lo demás resultar muy precioso. /// Ruled by subjectivity, the contemporary universe of belief is in all its parts of fluid circulation, immediately impervious to any structuring reference to any stability, unless this stability is posited as a purely operating principle. The aim of contemporary belief is not to achieve a "religious identity" (which would be conceived as "stable"), but to show that it can be a belief within movement. In fact, the concept of "religion", as well as the related concepts of "secularization" and "laicism" that are associated to it, happen to become, in a situation of total social legitimacy of radical individualization in constructing a relation with meaning, increasingly indeterminate and consequently utterly useless concepts, at least as far as there persists the will to grant them a pertinence of their own. "Religion", for that reason, is nothing m~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25619787<br>
Date: 8 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: There are, of course, discussions of this sort in a variety of modern moral and political
theories. For example Onora O'Neill has given accounts of this issue from a strongly
Kantian perspective, and the notion of reasonableness and what it leads to plays a central
role in John Finnis's influential rearticulation of Natural Law theory. See Onora O'Neill,
'Vindicating Reason', in The Cambridge Companion to Kant, ed. Paul Guyer (Cambridge,
1992); and John Finnis, Natural Law and Natural Rights (Oxford, 1980). The beginnings
of my own approach to this question can be found in Political Theory, Modernity and
Postmodernity, Chs. 3 and 4.<br>

Abstract: Of the isolation of mythemes from collected versions of the myth, Paz
remarks that "one of the characteristics of myths is the recurrence of certain
themes and motifs. In this way, we can reconstruct incomplete versions and
even discover mythemes which, for one or another reason, do not appear
in any version" (pp. 28-29).<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Abstract: Temporal lobe epilepsy and certain personality disorders often result in experiences described as "religious." TLE research suggests a possible neurological basis for such experiences. Immediately the question arises about the authenticity of these experiences as religious. An experience is authentic if it furthers the authentic growth of the subject, regardless of what triggered it. So pathology may occasion authentic religious experiences, even as history exemplifies. For practical purposes, the further question about God in religious experience is secondary. The exception, miraculous occurrences, should not be granted without sufficient reason. This approach dissolves all conflict between science and faith.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>

Author(s): DiCenso James<br>
Abstract: This paper engages Freud's relation to Kant, with specific reference to each theorist's articulation of the interconnections between ethics and religion. I argue that there is in fact a constructive approach to ethics and religion in Freud's thought, and that this approach can be better understood by examining it in relation to Kant's formulations on these topics. Freud's thinking about religion and ethics participates in the Enlightenment heritage, with its emphasis on autonomy and rationality, of which Kant's model of practical reason is in many ways exemplary. At the same time, Freud advances Kantian thinking in certain important respects; his work offers a more somatically, socially, and historically grounded approach to the formation of rational and ethical capacities, and hence makes it more compatible with contemporary concerns and orientations that eschew the pitfalls of ahistorical idealist orientations.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo pretende abordar, desde una perspectiva analítica, la posibilidad de fundamentar las posiciones morales de la izquierda. En ese sentido, se analiza, en primer lugar, por qué la izquierda necesita de un discurso moral; una vez establecido que la izquierda es necesariamente moral, se investiga cuál puede ser la fundamentación de esa moral particular; y en tercer y último lugar, se descarta la posibilidad de que, al no encontrar fundamentación, quepa la posibilidad de omitirla. This article will try to address from an analytical position the possibility of portraying the foundations supporting the moral stances of the left. In this sense, the reason why the left needs a moral discourse is analysed in the first place; once the fact that the left is necessarily moral is established, the precise foundations supporting that specific moral is investigated; and thirdly and lastly, the possibility of omitting that supportive foundation given the absence of it, is rejected.<br>

Article Title: Shifting Loyalties: Critical Theory & the Problem of Legitimacy<br>
Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>

Author(s): Lukács William M.<br>
Abstract: Students of society are increasingly relating the legitimacy crisis facing industrial nations to the erosion of moral traditions. Habermas sees the problem as a historical crisis and calls for the reconstruction of our understanding of moral authority on the basis of practical reason, on which justice and truth rest. The key to our understanding of growth problems is to be found in our cultural situation rather than in the formalistic functional or instrumental theories of positivism. William Sullivan sees a major problem of Habermas's approach, which he subjects to careful examination, in the relation of theoretical understanding to engaged critical activity.<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>
Issue: i288896<br>
Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): JonasAbstract: In twentieth-century French writing, imagination, as a concept implying subjective agency, loses ground progressively to forms of thought that are no longer morally accountable to their cultural and historical context. This shift can be liked to the transition from a neutral to a critical sense of ideology. The best fiction exploits the tension between responsible subjectivity and its ideological impairment. Much theoretical writing, in contrast, retreats into a disempowering view of human agency as collectively or unconsciously determined. The opposition at work here between symbolic and abstract thought, or mythic and historical consciousness, points to the ethical urgency of rethinking Western concepts of reason.<br>

Abstract: Is history a category of reason, or is reason a category of history? These opposing questions have divided the structuralist from the materialist-but neither question is wrong. Analysis of the logic of oppositions challenges feminism, in particular, to find a logic-and a poetics-in which to render its values without historical or theoretical naiveté. I explore the question of the timing of feminism through Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40012947<br>
Date: 6 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Caffarena José Gómez<br>
Abstract: A filosofia prática de Kant, ou seja, o nuclear da sua ética, juntamente com o "primado da razão prática sobre a especulativa" e a "religião nos limites da simples razão", com seu acento no "mal radical", têm inegáveis afinidades com a - e em certos casos influxo da - tradição cristã. O próprio Kant terá em alguns momentos reconhecido isso mesmo. Segundo o autor do presente texto, subsistem, contudo, inegáveis divergências. O artigo, escrito a partir de uma declarada 'simpatia metódica, pretende precisar no possível o alcance de umas e de outras, fazendo sobre o tema um balanço positivo. O autor propõe ainda uma hipótese de leitura do Opus Postumum, reconhecendo aqui uma tentativa por parte de Kant no sentido de purificar o seu "teísmo moral" numa direcção que tão pouco é alheia a importantes intuições cristãs. /// Aim of the article is to show that the practical philosophy of Kant, or, in other terms, the core of his ethics, as is the case with the "primacy of the practical reason over the speculative one" and the "religion within the limits of pure reason", with its accent set upon the idea of "radical evil", have undeniable affinities with -and in certain cases influxes from - the Christian tradition. Kant himself seems to have recognized that much at certain moments. For the author of the article, however, there are a few divergences to be reckoned with. In fact, the article, which is clearly written from the standpoint of a declared methodic sympathy, does whatever is possible in order to determine the reach of the ones and of the others, but in the end concludes that the result is a positive one. The author also suggests a reading hypothesis for the Opus Postumum, acknowledging here an attempt on the part of Kant directed towards a purification of his "moral theism" in a direction that as such is no less close to some very important Christian intuitions.<br>

Article Title: Da indiferenciaçao do dizer ao autómaton da fala: Os Limites da Linguagem em Wittgenstein<br>

Date: 6 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Do Carmo Silva Carlos Henrique<br>
Abstract: O presente estudo constitui um ensaio crítico de reflexão sobre a questão dos limites da linguagem em Wittgenstein. A perspectiva deste estudo observa, numa primeira parte, o próprio procedimento do método wittgen-steiniano e segue um modelo de discurso plural, a partir de várias perspectivas que, não só permitem desconstruir a aparente unidade da razão, como indagar interiormente do próprio limite da análise wittgensteiniana. Retomando a caracterização da linguagem e do pensamento nos seus traços fundamentais, desde o "Tractatus" até às "Investigações Filosóficas", chama-se a atenção para os pontos de dificuldade, da indefinição e da cons-trutividade do modelo de Wittgenstein. A plena lição do "autómaton" da linguagem face a uma possível diferenciação dos signos e aprofundamento lógico, constitui uma parte desta reflexão que se complementa pela referência aos horizontes de resíduo do não-linguístico, ou até do indizível, numa dupla maneira de estabelecer os limites da linguagem. Enfim, e a título conclusivo, apontam-se, não apenas os contornos do que se entende como uma moral retórica da linguagem em Wittgenstein, mas para perspectivas originais de um reaprofundamento em termos etioló-gicos de diferenciação de escala da lógica e da linguagem, e de recuperação de uma intencionalidade psico-lógico-linguística superando aquela indiferen-ciação do dizer no automático da fala estatuída na "ordinary language". /// La présente étude constitue un essai critique qui réfléchie sur la question des limites du langage dans la philosophie de Wittgenstein. Dans une première partie la perspective de cette réflexion analise les procédés que Wittgenstein lui-même utilise dans sa méthode, et pour cela se sert d'un modèle de discours pluriel, lequel permet non seulement la déconstruction de l'apparente unité de la raison, mais aussi faire une enquête au dedans des limites de l'analyse wittgensteinienne.

Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Henriques Fernanda<br>
Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis. The approach this article takes, however, is to begin by treating a prior problematic~<br>

Abstract: O estruturalismo levistraussiano tern urn vasto alcance critico em relação ao conceitochave da filosofia do conhecimento que é a razão. Alicerçando a racionalidade num inconsciente universal, num sistema formal categórico, e postulando urn isomorfismo entre a natureza e a cultura, Lévi-Strauss faz uma critica nova da razão humana. Esta não pode ser concebida como consciência, como representação, tão ao gosto do racionalismo moderno e de algumas filosofias contemporàneas, nem perspectivada dialectica e temporalmente, como o fazem o positivismo e o hegelianismo. /// Levi-Strauss' structuralism strongly criticizes "reason", a key-concept in the philosophy of knowledge. Grounding rationality upon a universal unconscious and upon a categorical formal system, and postulating an isomorphism between nature and culture, Strauss produces a new criticism of human reason. Reason can no longer be conceived as it is both in modern rationalism and in some contemporary philosophical trends, as consciousness, as representation. Nor can it be thought of from either a temporal or a dialectical point of view, as it is in positivism and in hegelianism.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo reflecte sobre o significado critico dos conceitos de tradição e preconceito, noções fundamentias da filosofia hermeneutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer. Visa de forma particular a contestação que o autor faz da moderna redução do sentido da filosofia. Filosofia ou teoria da ciência, eis os termos de uma questão que atravessa o pensamento de Gadamer, desde Verdade e Método, até aos últimos textos. Para o filosofo, na raiz originária do sentido está um modo ôntico de ser, caracterizado pela memória, pelo efeito histórico da tradição e pela necessidade de formação. A razão, que se sabe hoje historica e finita, parte sempre de pressupostos, que marcam a sua basilar inserção na comunidade da palavra já sempre partilhada e nos lembram como é ilusório o sonho iluminista de uma transparência total. /// This article is a reflexion about the critical meaning of the concept of tradition and prejudice in the hermeneutical philosopphy of H.-G. Gadamer. It focuses on Gadamer's protest against the modern reduction of the meaning of philosophy. Philosophy or theory of science are the terms of the question that crosses all of Gadamer's thought, from Wahrheit und Methode until the later works. At the root of meaning is for Gadamer an ontological way of being characterized by memory, the historic effect of tradition and the need of formation. Reason, which we now know as historical and finite, is grounded on presuposed ideas which mark its fundamental insertion in the comunity of the world, already shared, and remind us of how deceptive the iluminist dream of a total transparency actually is.<br>

Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd. For Kierkegaard, the singular human being finds herself confronted with the Paradox precisely in the measure in which her existence does not fall under the dominion of metaphysics and of the aesthetical. The paradox ~<br>

Abstract: The rationalist fantasy of the Enlightenment is the myth of the nonviolent origins of virtue, typically represented through the image of rational birth. This myth falters when Odoardo Galotti, invoking the second birth of reason, kills his daughter. This article examines Lessing's Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts-essentially a treatise on the phylogeny/ontogeny distinction-in terms of a recuperative rationalist gesture that continues to inform Freud's oedipal theory as well as Claude Lévy-Strauss's understanding of the "cerebral savage." These theories are not treated as methodological frameworks for reading Lessing but rather as evidence of the tanacity of Enlightenment desires, which are already problematized by texts like Emilia Galotti.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Several representatives of structuralism relate the concept of structure to the langue of Ferdinand de Saussure. And so a linguistic approximation to structuralism seems possible. Such an approximation makes sense for another reason : because of the growing importance of transformational linguistics and the criticism of structuralism expressed by Noam Chomsky. In this article the main ideas of de Saussure and Chomsky are analysed, resulting in the confrontation of langue (de Saussure) and competence (Chomsky). Chomsky's criticism of langue as "a store of concepts" seems to be correct. The relevance of this criticism for the central structuralist topic that individual man, his freedom and his history are of minor importance, is pointed out.<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference.

Abstract: The title of the essay refers to the famous statement in Foucaults introduction to his History of Madness where he writes that "we have to do justice to Freud". The problem, however, is that Foucault's philosophy does not seem to do justice to Freud. Foucault's use of Freud is ambiguous: sometimes he uses him for purely instrumental purposes (when reconstructing the history of madness and sexuality), but sometimes—for anthropological purposes signaling Freud's role in redefining our common humanity and particularly our relation to language, life and work. The author confronts Foucault's ambiguous reading of Freud with the equally ambiguous reading of Foucault by Derrida. Derrida discusses Foucault twice. Once in the essay Cogito and The History of Madness in which Derrida takes on Foucault's understanding of Descartes and his role in the exclusion of madness from the realm of reason. The second time—in his essay To Do Justice to Freud. Here Derrida disagrees with Foucault whether Freud managed to reestablish the body's communication with reason which Descartes destroyed.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40070293<br>
Date: 10 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Zembrzycki Stacey<br>
Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Author(s): Simonett Helena<br>
Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Publisher: Tsehai Publishers<br>
Issue: i40081926<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a critical reappraisal of Abba Bahrey's Zenahu leGalla, the controversial 16th century text. Some scholars criticize it as harbouring anti-Oromo sentiments while others praise it as an important source on the organization of Oromo society The paper argues that, while Zenahu leGalla does provide useful historical information on the Oromo, its lasting value lies elsewhere: in the critical reflection it initiates on the issues of power, freedom, social change, violence, and the public use of reason. To unpack these issues, occluded by current interpretations of Zenahu leGalla, the paper undertakes a critical hermeneutical reading of the text. The reading shows that Bahrey's text incubates emancipatory surplus meanings that transcend his epoch and speak to the concerns of contemporary Ethiopia. In the concluding sections, the paper discusses the issues of democracy and development in light of these surplus meanings.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40084882<br>
Date: 4 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mitchell Joshua<br>
Abstract: Because Hobbes is understood to be a proto-liberal thinker, a great deal hinges on how we understand his writings. Does he contribute to the development of a purely secular political self-understanding, as many liberals today claim? And, by extension, does that mean that liberal thought today best stands on a purely secular foundation? What, then, should we make of the extensive theological speculation throughout his Leviathan! Here, I argue that to reconcile the seemingly purely secular claims in Leviathan with the obviously religious claims found there we must move beyond reading him in terms of what I here call 'the fable of liberalism', and comprehend Leviathan as a whole in terms of Reformation era debates between Protestants and Roman Catholics about the limits and purview of reason. Understood in that way we see his claims about 'reason' in a new and important light. Rather than being an inevitable development that comes to supercede honour and glory, as the fable of liberalism suggests, 'reason' is seen to have an historically contingent character, whose parameters are established by wagers about the meaning of religious experience.<br>

Abstract: No encadeamento de oito temas analisam-se tensões e aporias (no sentido mais platónico que aristotélico) inerentes à compreensão filosófica da obra de arte. (1) Quem compreende melhor a essência da arte, o filósofo ou o artista? Noutros termos, qual o papel da razão na compreensão da arte? (2) A arte permanece na procura do belo ou rege-se hoje apenas pela busca de expressão do artista? (3) Mas então será o artista um ser de exceção? (4) Por sua vez, esta questão leva à distinção entre a forma e o conteúdo da obra de arte. (5) O "conteúdo" da obra remete para o problema da "finalidade" da obra. (6) Na linha da finalidade surge a função central da arte, isto é, a fruição pela "trans-figuração" do mundo. Na esteira desta função abrem-se tres problemas, brevemente evocados: (7) a dimensão social e política da arte; (8) os êxitos facéis e os fracassos da arte, assim como (9) o eventual esgotamento da arte na atitude estética. In lacing together eight themes, the article analyzes tensions and aporias (more in the Platonic sense than the Aristotelian) inherent in the philosophical understanding of a work of art. (1) Who best understands the essence of art, the philosopher or the artist? Otherwise said, what is the role of reason in the understanding of art? (2) Does art reside in the search of the beautiful, or does it orient itself today by the artists expression? (3) What makes an artist an exceptional human being? (4) This leads us to the distinction between form and content in a work of art. (5) The "content" of a work refers to its finality. (6) In the line of finality, the central function of art appears, i.e., the fruition through the "trans-figuration" of the world. In the wake of this function, three problems are briefly presented: (7) the social and political dimension of art; (8) the easy successes and failures of art, as well as (9) the eventual emptying of art in aesthetic attitude.<br>

Author(s): Kemp Peter<br>
Abstract: L'auteur vise à scruter le fondement de l'éthique en opposant la conception éthique de Paul Ricoeur à celle de deux de ses prédécesseurs, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. Il montre comment Ricœur a défini la notion de raison pratique qui se distingue radicalement de toute science, et comment il a développé son éthique sans vision de l'évolution biologique et anthropologique. Grâce à Aristote et en passant par Kant, il a montré, dans Soi-même comme un autre (1990), le rôle éthique de la narrativité dans la formation de l'identité personnelle et de la responsabilité. The author proposes an analysis of the foundation of ethics by opposing Paul Ricoeur's conception of ethics to that of two of his predecessors, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. He shows how Ricœur has defined the notion of practical reason as radically different from any science, and how he has developed his ethics in independence from considerations related to biological and anthropological evolution. In Oneself as Another (1990), on the basis of Aristotle and reformulated in relation to Kantian principles, he has demonstrated the role of ethics and narration in the formation of personal identity and responsibility.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40086215<br>
Date: 6 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Welsen Peter<br>
Abstract: La « petite éthique » que déploie Ricœur dans Soi-même comme un autre se distingue par le fait qu'elle rend justice à l'individu, à l'autre et à la communauté tout à la fois. C'est ainsi que le problème de la distribution des biens sociaux se révèle fondamental. Ricœur essaie de le résoudre à partir d'une synthèse de considérations téléologiques et déontologiques dans laquelle l'approche de Rawls occupe une position centrale. D'un côté, la tentative de résoudre le problème dans le cadre d'une approche téléologique appelle le recours aux principes de justice qu'établit Rawls à l'aide d'une procédure formelle, de l'autre, la position rawlsienne dépend d'un nombre de présuppositions téléologiques qui ne sont pas compatibles avec son approche déontologique. Ricœur ne poursuit pas simplement le but de réfuter Rawls, il propose plutôt d'interpréter ses principes de justice comme résultat d'une rationalisation d'un sens de justice préalable. The « minor ethics » which Ricœur develops in Soi-même comme un autre is distinctive in its way of applying justice to the individual, the other and the community all at the same time. For this reason the problem of distribution of social goods is fundamental. Ricœur attempts to resolve this problem through a synthesis of teleological and deontological considerations, and here the approach of Rawls occupies a central place. On one hand, the attempt to solve this problem in the framework of a teleological approach draws on principles of justice which Rawls establishes through formal procedure ; on the other hand, Rawls' position depends on a number of teleological presuppositions which are not compatible with his deontological approach. Ricœur does not only attempt to refute Rawls, but to interpret his principles of justice as the result of a rationalisation of a sense of justice which is simply presupposed.<br>

Author(s): Blatz Charles V.<br>
Abstract: Moving from repression or tyranny toward the rule of law and reason is fraught with difficulties. One question of transitional justice is whether those responsible for the horrors of the previous régime should be punished or whether those involved in the transition should travel a path toward forgiveness and unity. Within this article, it is urged that in the (re-)establishment of the rule of reason among all involved there is a commitment to peace as opposed to force. This commitment marks retribution and utilitarian punishment as incoherent and normatively indefensible. Resorting to punishment is the abandonment of reason, not its reinstatement. Indeed, the point can be generalized. Punishment, as resorting to force, is a move away from establishing or sustaining a framework of justification and its commitment to peace.<br>

Author(s): Malcus Lawrence<br>
Abstract: This article explores the influences of developments in philosophy on psychotherapy beginning with philosophers of the ancient Greek world. Psychotherapy owes much to ways of thinking employed by Greek philosophers attempting to understand the nature of the world and the relationships between humans, each other, and the world. The questions these philosophers asked, the answers they provided, and the methods they devised to address their questions remain pertinent to psychotherapists today. Greek philosophers engaged in dialectics and used reason to overcome the unreliability of the senses. Reason was deemed able to determine truth until philosophers, Nietzsche prominent among them, unseated reason from its throne. The article concludes with a discussion of themes and observations important to Nietzsche and postmodern philosophy, toward which Nietzsche's work pointed, and discusses their relevance to group psychotherapy.<br>

Abstract: A l'opposé des discours philosophiques contemporains, la Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) d'Éric Weil reprend pour l'essentiel l'idée kantienne de la loi morale. Mais elle déplace la problématique de la fondation en procédant selon la méthode de l'« analyse génétique » qui concilie « développement phénoménologique » et « exposé encyclopédique ». Le chemin des apories de la réflexion morale conduit à la conscience de soi philosophique de la question morale comme question, et comme question irréductible, c'est-à-dire comme question que se pose une liberté qui a déjà, sans raison, choisi la raison. Contrary to the contemporary philosophical discourses, E. Weil's Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) resumes in his essential part the kantian idea of the moral law. But E. Weil displaces the problem of foundation, proceeding by the method of « genetical analysis » which conciliates « phenomenological development » and « encyclopaedic exposition » . The way of the apories of the moral reflexion leads into the philosophical self-consciousness of the moral question as a question, and as an irreducible question, in other words as a question stated to a freedom which has, without reason, already chosen the reason.<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>

Author(s): THOUARD Denis<br>
Abstract: Si l'on admet que l'herméneutique part de la reconnaissance d'une intention de signifier donnée déposée dans des signes, force est de considérer que l'entreprise kantienne s'y oppose, aussi bien d'un point de vue systématique que d'un point de vue historique. On critiquera à cette occasion la tentative de tirer du kantisme, en particulier de la troisième Critique, un point de départ pour une herméneutique. L'étude de « l'herméneutique morale » de l'écrit sur la religion replacé dans le contexte de la critique biblique de son époque apporte une confirmation des analyses systématiques et souligne les limites du dispositif kantien. Les reproches adressés par les tenants de « l'école mythique » de Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) à la Religion dans les limites de la simple raison reviennent à distinguer nettement jugement et interprétation : Kant met en oeuvre un jugement, et non une interprétation. If one admits that the starting point of hermeneutics is a recognition of an intention to signify facts left in signs, then one must recognize that the project of Kant is opposed to this starting point, both from a systematic and historical point of view. The temptation to take from the works of Kant, especially the Third Critique, a starting point for hermeneutics will be subject to analysis. A study of « moral hermeneutics » that is drawn from the texts of religion (and which is done within the context of the biblical criticism of their period) confirms the analysis et underlines the limits of the Kantian plan of action. The criticisms of the « l'école mythique » of Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) aimed at Religion within the limits of simple reason aid to clearly distinguish between judgement and interpretation. Kant implements a judgment and not an interpretation.<br>

Abstract: The present-day global culture challenges First-World theologians to coalesce with Third-World theologians. Such an enterprise is conditioned by the identification of commonalities in theological inquiry. Hermeneutics of the Bible, and especially of the New Testament, is an important common ground for 'traditional theology' and 'contextual theology' alike. This paper, however, argues that there is a foundational reason why the historical Jesus and not the canon should be seen as the common ground for the engagement by First-World as well as Third-World theologians. This argument relates to the epistemic status of the canon in liberation theology. The canon originated during the time when the horticultural society shifted to an agrarian one. This shift was accompanied by, among other things, the process of urbanisation and the increase of inequality and of the scarcity of resources. Our memory of the historical Jesus tradition keeps us in touch with Jesus' emancipatory living during these circumstances—an emancipatory living that unmasks the hegemony that could be embedded in the canon.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: Cet article rappelle les ambitions et les enjeux théoriques qui ont conduit Sen à penser une nouvelle conception de l'avantage individuel et des évaluations sociales. Souvent perçue comme relevant de la philosophie morale, l'approche par les capabilités (AC) apparaît comme l'œuvre d'un théoricien du choix social dont l'éclectisme des recherches a permis d'aboutir à une approche du choix social plus ouverte et moins mécanique que celle proposée par Arrow en 1950. Grâce à une concentration nouvelle sur l'espace des potentiels et des capacités individuels et un glissement essentiel du rationnel vers le raisonnable, l'AC offre un cadre renouvelé pour l'économie normative. This article recalls the ambitions and theoretical issues that led Sen to develop a new conception of individual advantage and social evaluation. This Capability Approach (CA) is often regarded as moral philosophy. However, it arose from the work of a social choice theorist, whose eclecticism allowed a social choice approach to be formulated, which is more open and less mechanistic than that proposed by Arrow (1950). Due to its new focus on the scope of individual potential and capacities, and a substantial shift from rationality to reason, Sens CA provides a renewed theoretical framework for normative economics.<br>

Abstract: This paper renews the problem of Africa's international presence, presence which for a long time has been contested by the Path dependence theory in international relations relegating Africa to the periphery of the world linking its destiny to that of the Western World. This thesis is anthropologically and historically erroneous for the simple reason that colonial era is an impertinent sign of Africa's presence in the international scene; rather, a long time before one could enable an objective appropriate restitution of Africa's implication in the world which began even before the colonial era (transsaharian trade, establishment of Indonesian colonies in Madagascar, regular trade with India, the regions of the Persian Golf and the Mediterranean).<br>

Abstract: A metafísica aristotélica não considera o ser enquanto ser em si mesmo, mas enquanto símbolo daquilo que é simultaneamente o mais universal e o mais singular para o espírito. Platão antecipou a concepção propondo uma dialéctica ascendente, completada por uma dialéctica descendente, cuja dinâmica fora objecto de pesquisa nas suas últimas obras. A metafísica encontra-se na intersecção destas duas dialécticas, no eixo em que a primeira passa na outra. Este eixo começa a fazer sentido a partir do saber que o pensamento tem de si mesmo. A mentalidade representativa, desatenta à especificidade deste eixo, não consegue aceder à dimensão dos caminhos da razão. O eixo no coração das dialécticas clássicas é assumido pela metafísica contemporânea em termos de tempo associado com o espírito vivo em detrimento do ser conceptual. Aristotelian metaphysics does not consider being qua being in itself, but rather as a symbol of what is, for the spirit, at once the most universal and the most particular. Plato had anticipated the conception, the dynamic of which had been the object of investigation in his last works. Metaphysics finds itself at the intersection of these two dialectics, at the axis around which the first passes into the other. The axis takes its sense from the knowledge that thought has of itself. The mentality, based on representation, inattentive to the specificity of this axis, does not have access to the amplitude of the paths that reason can take. The axis at the heart of classic dialectics is taken up by contemporary metaphysics in terms of time associated with the living spirit rather than as conceptual being.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: Les limites du rapport fertile entre Foi et Raison sont celles qui cernent les identités respectives de chacun des trois auteurs abordés. Témoignant de leur « air de famille » ils se rejoignent par une profonde valorisation personnelle et éclairent l'intellectualisme optimiste qui caractérise une certaine conscience occidentale. The limits of the fruitful relationship between Faith and Reason are those which define the identities of each of the three Authors concerned here. Giving testimony to their "family likeness", they share a strong self-actualisation, and shed light on the optimistic intellectualism that is typical of a certain Western consciousness.<br>

Abstract: Suite à une question initiale du théologien catholique Adrian Holderegger, l'auteur s'interroge sur la question du rôle de la raison en théologie et en éthique théologique. Il présente et discute la critique de la raison sourde proposée par Maurice Bellet. Les relations entre la rationalité athétique, athématique et amodale conduisent à se demander si une conception négative et critique de la rationalité ne serait pas la condition d'un redéploiement positif de la raison de l'être humain singulier comme capacité d'écoute attentive de l'autre, du monde et de Dieu. Following up an initial question raised by the Catholic theologian Adrian Holderegger, the author questions the role of reason in theology and in theological ethics. He presents and discusses the critique of blind reason proposed by Maurice Bellet. The interactions between a-thetic, a-thematic and a-modal rationality leads one to wonder if a negative and critical conception of rationality might not be the condition for a positive redeployment of a single human beings reason as capacity for attentive listening to others, to the world and to God.<br>

Abstract: Le projet de Pierre Thévenaz d'une «philosophie sans absolu» est le fruit de la rencontre entre la raison philosophique et l'expérience-choc de l'annonce chrétienne, qui restitue à l'humain sa dimension uniquement et radicalement humaine. Le monde d'ici-bas devient ainsi le lieu de l'homme dans son histori cité. La méthode de cette conversion à l'en deçà est celle d'une radicalisation de la philosophie reflexive. Si désormais «la raison c'est l'homme», la tâche d'une «philosophie sans absolu» devient l'herméneutique de la condition humaine. P. Thévenaz' project for a "philosophy without an absolute" is the fruit of the meeting of philosophical Reason with the shock-experience of the Christian message which restored to humankind its unique and radically human dimension. The earthly world thus becomes the place of humankind in its historicity. The method of converting to this side is a radicalisation of reflexive philosophy. If henceforth "reason is mankind", then the work of a "philosophy without an absolute" becomes the hermeneutics of the human condition.<br>

Abstract: La question des rapports entre éthique philosophique et éthique théologique est au cœur de la pensée de Friedrich Daniel Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposant une conception originale de la raison dans ses liens à la nature et à l'histoire, l'auteur des Discours et de la Foi chrétienne restructure l'éthique philosophique autour des notions de Biens, de vertus et de devoirs. Quels liens une telle vision de l'éthique entretient-elle avec l'interprétation théologique de thèmes comme le Royaume de Dieu, la rédemption, la justification par la foi et la sanctification ? La concentration téléologique sur les Biens (Güterlehre) et sur le Bien suprême est-elle à comprendre aussi en un sens théologique ? Et si oui, comment penser la relation entre la dogmatique, la dialectique et l'éthique, non seulement chez Schleiermacher, mais dans le contexte moderne et postmoderne qui est le nôtre ? The relation between philosophical and theological ethics is at the centre of the thought of F. D. Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposing an original conception of reason in its connection to nature and to history, the author of Discourses and of The Christian Faith restructures philosophical ethics around the notions of the Good, of virtues and of duties. What connection does such a vision of ethics have with the theological interpretation of themes like the Kingdom of god, redemption, justification by faith and sanctification? Can the teleological focus on the Good fGüterlehrej andón the supreme Good be also understood theologically? If yes, how should one think of the relation between dogmatics, dialectics and ethics, not only in Schleiermacher, but in the modern and postmodern context of our age?<br>

Abstract: Où situer le danger ? Qui court un risque et qui le fait courir à qui ? Il s'agit de présenter deux analyses inverses de la notion de danger. Leur originalité tient au fait qu'il ne semble pas y avoir pour elles d'équité ou de réciprocité dans le danger: la menace vient exclusivement d'un côté de la relation. Pour Hegel, c'est le moi qui est l'objet de menaces. L'auteur de ces menaces est toujours l'autre, celui que je ne suis pas, et c'est précisément son altérité qui en fait une puissance dont je peux craindre la violence. C'est pourquoi la vérité – et la sécurité – se trouve toujours du côté de la réduction de la transcendance de l'autre. Pour cette raison, Levinas affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre dans la philosophie de Hegel, absence qu'il analyse justement comme un danger: c'est l'autre qui court un risque, et la menace vient de moi. La menace n'émane plus de l'étrangeté de l'autre, mais au contraire de la suppression de cette étrangeté. Ce qu'il est à craindre est, pour Hegel, que l'autre mette la main sur moi, et, pour Levinas, que je mette la main sur l'autre. Where is the danger? Who is at risk and who is a menace to whom? This article presents two opposite analyses of the notion of danger. Their originality lies in the fact that there seems to be no fairness or reciprocity in danger: the threat comes exclusively from one side of the relationship. For Hegel, oneself is always the object of threats. The source of these threats is always the other person, the one I am not, and it is precisely the other's alterity which is a force whose violence I should fear. That is why truth - and security – are always to be found in reducing the transcendence of the other. For this reason, Levinas claims that there is not an other in the philosophy of Hegel, an absence which he analyses as a danger; it's the other who is at risk, and the threat comes from me. The threat no longer emanates from the strangeness of the other, but, on the contrary, from the suppression of this ~<br>

Abstract: A la fin du XIVe siècle, le Dialogue de Catherine de Sienne expose, par sa construction littéraire extrêmement élaborée, la conversion du mouvement raisonnable de recherche du divin en mouvement intelligent de contemplation, la conversion du langage théologique en langage de l'intelligence de l'âme, la conversion du langage difficile de la raison en langage métaphorique audible par tous et susceptible de ramener tous les hommes dans l'obéissance à l'Eglise. La méthode de connaissance recommandée par Catherine est celle des larmes. At the end of the 14th century, the Dialogo of Catherine of Sienna expounds in a very elaborate literary construction the conversion of the reasonable search for the divine into intelligent contemplation, the conversion of theological language into that of the comprehending soul, the conversion of the difficult language of the reason into a metaphorical one, understandable to everyone and fit to bring all men back to obedience to the Church. The method of knowledge which Catherine advises is that of the tears. En el final del siglo XIV, el Dialogo de Caterina de Sena por su construcción literaria muy elaborada expone la conversión del movimiento racional de búsqueda de Dios en el movimiento inteligente de contemplación, la conversión del lenguaje teológico en el lenguaje de la inteligencia del alma, la conversión del lenguaje difícil de la razón en el lenguaje metafórico que todos entienden y que puede reducir a todos en la obediencia a la Iglesia. El método de conocimiento preconizado por Caterina es el de las lágrimas.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: Relecture de l'inédit de Jean Nahert: « La conscience peut-elle se comprendre? » dans l'optique de la philosophie herméneutique contemporaine. Dès 1934, la philosophie de Nahert opère une percée en direction du concept herméneutique d'autocompréhension, même si sa formulation originale du problème exige de quiconque défend le concept de « raison herméneutique » un très sévère « examen de conscience ». C'est ce que montre une analyse de la formule « l'inquiétude du se comprendre » dont on rencontre de nombreuses occurrences dans le texte. Même si le terme « désir de Dieu » n'apparaît pas dans ce texte de 1934, on peut y discerner l'annonce de la thèse que « ce sont les conditions de possibilité de la conscience de soi qui fondent le désir de Dieu ». Rereading Jean Nabert's unpublished « Can Conscience Understand Itself » through the eyes of contemporary hermeneutical philosophy. As early as 1934, Nabert's philosophy makes a breakthrough in the direction of the hermeneutical concept of autocomprehension even if, in its original formulation, it demands a very severe « examination of conscience » of whomever defends the concept of « hermeneutical reason ». This is shown by an analysis of the expression « the unrest of understanding oneself » repeated several times in the text And even if the expression « desire for God » does not appear in this 1934 text, one can discern there the beginnings of the thesis that « it is the conditions of the possibility of conscience of self that found the desire for God ».<br>

Author(s): Williams Donald L.<br>
Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Author(s): Adorno Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Author(s): Traverso Regina M.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226394<br>
Date: 11 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Witherspoon Robert<br>
Abstract: An ethnographic study of the words and actions common to a shelter for people considered homeless and mentally ill shows how distinct forms of reasoning and personal agency relate to a set of practical concerns and political exigencies. Whereas the shelter's staff rely on and promote a referential language and direct, active forms of agency, its residents depend on tactical, persuasive uses of language and oblique, reactive forms of agency. Yet because the staff have the upper hand politically, their orientations to language, thought, and action take a more central role in encouraging people to act in sincere and reasonable ways. The residents draw on ideas of sincerity, reason, and personal accountability, but in makeshift ways, with the result that the ideas are caught up in the rhetoric of self-presentation. The article's findings underscore the need for anthropologists to attend to the diverse means, and political, linguistic, and cultural grounds, of human reason and agency.

Abstract: Based on ethnographic work among North American occupational therapists, I compare two forms of everyday clinical talk. One, "chart talk," conforms to normative conceptions of clinical rationality. The second, storytelling, permeates clinical discussions but has no formal status as a vehicle for clinical reasoning. I argue that both modes of discourse provide avenues for reasoning about clinical problems. However, these discourses construct very different clinical objects and different phenomena to reason about. Further, the clinical problems created through storytelling point toward a more radically distinct conception of rationality than the one underlying biomedicine as it is formally conceived. Clinical storytelling is more usefully understood as a mode of Aristotle's "practical rationality" than the technical rationality of modern (enlightenment) conceptions of reasoning.<br>

Abstract: This paper applies the critical theory of Jürgen Habermas to theoretical issues in criminology. Since criminologists have generally neglected the critical tradition, we include a brief summation of concerns central to critical sociology. These concerns include a defense of reason and a provocative critique of both culture and science. We then apply the critical model to themes and issues in criminology. Specifically, our analysis uses Habermas' three "knowledge constitutive interests" to reconceptualize cultural explanations of crime, to address the linkage between macro-and micro-levels of explanation, and to outline a novel interpretation of the relationship between culture and social structure. We conclude with a critique of Habermas' prescription for social change.<br>

Abstract: ‘The action turn’ stands over against ‘the linguistic turn’ that was a development in Western philosophy during the 20th century. Its most important characteristic is its focus on philosophy and language. Ludwig Wittgenstein’s influence is strong as the term follows from his claim that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language and his later comments on language games. See

Abstract: The literary field in Africa came into emergence as a result of a collective yearning for lesser dependency on the symbolic constraints the Western center is forcing on its margins. Granted that a work sets itself up by setting up its own context, and that the African context stands out as one where oral literature is still alive in society, the manifestation of expressive forms associated with traditional literature in a novel must carry heavy weight in an interpretation of African works. For that reason, this essay will argue that, through her “smuggling” of narrative forms drawn from oral literature, Aminata Sow Fall's fiction testifies to an oral discursivity at work in the novel. The archi-textual approach focuses on various strategies the Senegalese woman writer resorts to in order to inscribe, deep within her creative work in French, a traditional universe hitherto conveyed through oral forms of expression.<br>

Abstract: In his essay “The Style of Autobiography”, Jean Starobinski remarks, “One would hardly have sufficient motive to write an autobiography had not some radical change occurred […] conversion, entry into a new life, the operations of Grace”. From the beginning, the traumatic events of Keller's childhood — her loss of sight and hearing around age two — marked her not only as “outsider” and “other” but also as “autobiographer” even before she acquired language. “I can show so little visible proof of living”, Keller confessed. Perhaps for this reason she filled the “white darkness” she lived in with writing — first with finger spelling traced in the hand, then with Braille, and finally with type. While each medium seemed to bring her closer to the dream — her own and her century's — of transparent communication, so each text she produced threatened to turn into a “black box”, an instrument designed to collect and preserve data for analysis following a catastrophic event, but one that inevitably fails to illumine the inner world of Keller's deaf-blindness. This essay explores Keller's dreaming within the black box of writing, following her impossible desire for an “instrument which will show what takes place in the mind when we think”.<br>

Abstract: Tropes for poetic relationality proliferate and concatenate. And there is so much more to say. The topic of poetic copia is indeed so abundant as to suggest myriad forking paths of contemplation and investigation. Hidden within the present reflections are dozens of doors leading to other rooms of thought that this article unfortunately does not have the luxury to open. The poets of the Latin American neobaroque—including Argentines Néstor Perlongher, Osvaldo Lamborghini, and Arturo Carrera, Uruguyans Roberto Echavarren and Eduardo Milán, Cuban American José Kozer, and Peruvian Argentine Reynaldo Jimenez—are in deep dialogue with cannibalistic poetics, as De Campos argues in his analysis of “anthropophagous reason” (which he defines as a “ludic space of polyphony and of language in convulsion”).
         
               In the twentieth and twenty-first century there is also a suggestive plethora of poetic frauds, hoaxes, and impersonations—the Ern Malley hoax and Christopher Reid's143
            Katerina Brac, to name just two. Multilingual poetics, with its play on shifting linguistic identities, interlanguage, and polyphony, presents another avenue that would be fruitful for exploration; as does new media poetics that makes use of digital technology. As cultural processes that mingle past and present texts, such cannibalistic poetry participates in a form of cultural philosophy
               that unseats dualistic notions of genius and non-genius, source and derivative, and argues implicitly or explicitly against the metaphysics of origin.144<br>

Abstract: Little engaged with current scholarship in world literature, Apter's book is equally selective in its reference to translation studies. Derrida's work in this area is certainly important, and there is no reason why a problem-centered book would need to survey the full range of translation theory, but Apter neglects major figures whose work could enrich her argument at many points. A broader view of the politics of untranslatability, for example, could supplement Derrida's brief essay “Des tours de Babel” with the hermeneutic theory of George Steiner's
      After Babel(Oxford, 1975). Only cited for a comment on Eleanor Marx's Flaubert translation (283), Steiner could have provided valuable insights on the resistance of language to translation, which he sees as stemming from cultures' desire to protect their “alternities” from outside eyes. At least Steiner gets a passing glance. Apart from a string citation in a single footnote (4),Against World Literaturenowhere discusses or even mentions such seminal figures in the “cultural turn” of contemporary translation studies as Susan Bassnett, André Lefevere, Gideon Toury, Harish Trivedi, or Lawrence Venuti, even though from the 1980s onward these theorists revolutionized a previously formalist field to address issues of power, inequality, and the thorniness of language.<br>

Abstract: In “Child Soldier,” from
         Before the Palm Could Bloom, the speaker erects a spiritual monument for the “war children / who follow men who have lost all reason” (19). Each of the poem's six stanzas begins with, or is constructed around, a different name. These names—Saye, Ghapu, Kahieh, Nimley, Kortu, Wlemunga—are drawn from the different tribes and ethnicities in Liberia. Ghapu is a Bassa name meaning “light skinned” or “white man.” Nimley means “victor” or “I have survived.” Kortu means “end the war.”

Abstract: By contrast, Jacques Maquet observes the separate status of North or European Africa but gives no reason for its omission from the cultural areas of the African continent. Maquet, however, makes a strong but speculative case for the cultural unity of sub-Saharan Africa. He begins by first stressing the great diversity that is present throughout the continent. But he also insists that there is cultural unity: “From Conakry to Mogadishu, from Khartoum to Durban, one may perceive a certain felt quality.” Maquet argues that while certain material cultural products such as sculpture are diverse, perhaps encompassing hundreds of different styles, “it is easy to perceive a certain relationship between African works of different origin, since one can pick them out from collection of traditional pieces from Oceania, America, and Asia.”
         
               Maquet does present empirical data as the basis for what may appear to be an assertive intuitive and speculative thesis. He divides the continent of Africa, excluding North Africa, into six civilizations: the civilizations of the bow, of the clearings, the granary, the spear, of cities, and of industry. Maquet is at pains to make sure that he does not account for this unity in terms of any sort of racial or biological essentialism. The unity seems to be a trait acquired through the adaptation to the ecology of the continent and through the various modes the inhabitants have created to maintain their existence.12<br>

Abstract: But just the other day I got a kind of Rip van Winkle testimony from my friend Dick Howard, of Stony Brook, who apparently hasn't attended SPEP since the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting in Toronto. He's here for a panel tomorrow, and he sent me an e-mail, from which I quote, in part, with permission: “Just have been looking at SPEP program—it's extraordinary how it's grown and the diversity of things going on there. A ‘victory’ that at the same time comes with a diversification that perhaps gives more breath than depth? History will judge.” So there you have it! The judgment of history! SPEP flourishes today, a major force in American philosophy, and its “victory” seems to justify and redeem in retrospect all those early struggles, the slaughter bench of the early days, the courage and prescience of that small band of outsiders and oddballs. It makes a good story, as history always should: the triumph of the little guys over enormous odds. In Hegelian terms, reason exercised its cunning and brought about results unforeseeable, almost unimaginable, in those far-off days of 1962—or was it 1961? In philosophical terms, history has rendered its judgment.<br>

Article Title: The Plight of Ethics<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: To understand the effects of killing machines on both the victims and the perpetrators, we need a psychoanalytic supplement, to work through the double bind of ethics and politics. In order to begin to think about our own investments in state-sanctioned violence, we need to consider the ways in which death penalties of all kinds find their place not only in economic and political power struggles but also in revenge fantasies that fuel them, whichever side they are on. To this end, we need to consider the psyche as between reason and unreason, between plight as Kantian duty and responsilbity as Levinasian hostage, in order to bind and rebind ethics and politics, by virtue of our sociality that makes us subjects capable of both love and hate, desire and fear. Once you add the postulations of the unconscious to critical philosophy, it becomes necessary to analyze and avow our own psychic investments in state-sanctioned violence, killing, and war. Psychoanalytic avowal is another form of plight or pledge in the sense of vowing an oath to admit and explore our own economic and psychic investments in the violence we say that we abhor. This is particularly relevant when we feel outraged or wronged and want payback. Recall the “with us or against us” reactions to September 11, 2001, and the continued political discourse on “hunting down” terrorists and “making them pay.” Think, too, of all of the revenge fantasies—too many to begin to list—that populate our cultural imaginary evidenced by popular media, including a new TV soap opera aplty called

Abstract: Of course, it is obvious that we come to know “persons” (or “personal I's”) by a process of comparison, that is, we understand persons not merely as what “I” refers to but as what I's have, what Husserl would call their “habitualities.” That is, we refer to them as beings in the world with others. In this respect knowing persons is indeed a matter of an identification of someone by
            per accidens individuation. The distinguishing properties that single me out for myself and for you in terms of bodily shape, species or kind, face, psychical and moral traits, gender, profession, autobiography, ethnicity, nationality, locality, place in time, and so on and so forth are a matter of individuationper accidensor of relating me or the other person to what is other than me or other than she or he. Yet, if we may consider the hypothesis that there is a sense in which what “I” refers to is not a mere bundle or constellation of properties (which in principle is repeatable), we may entertain a sense in which what/whom “I” refers to is nonsortal—nonpropertied—and this may give us reason to pause in thinking ofpersonsimply as a sortal term.<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: That period (1980–81) symbolized the end of the “then” period. Critical theory, with its close ties to the interpretation of Marx, was no longer front and center. But the idea of critique was still alive, or at least we thought that it could be kept alive given the ominous truth of criticism that associated critique and ideology (Gadamer). At least we tried. Some four years after the publication of the first issue of
            Cultural Hermeneutics, Reidel, the publisher, suddenly and with little warning discontinued the journal. Whether it was Reidel's penchant for the good life or that we were the lowest journal in the hierarchy I never knew, but this much was clear, unless something unusual happened my life as a journal editor was over. As I was mulling over what to do, a process that took months, I received a late-night call from a former graduate student who was on his way to a distinguished career. His question was simple: “Dave, if you give up, where are we going to get published?” I took the question seriously; I bit the bullet, as it were—whoever said something could not be created out of nothing—and I started a publishing company to privately publish my journal. And by the most unusual stroke of luck I and the grad students associated with me at the time changed the nameCultural HermeneuticstoPhilosophy and Social Criticism. Unbelievably the phrase “social criticism” had not yet caught the public's imagination, and the choice of title was a stroke of pure luck. Significantly this change of title marked a transition in my view of critical theory, as reflected in the new editorial statement: “In modern industrial society reason cannot be separated from practical life. At their interface a critical attitude is forged.” The statement, which now sounds a bit passé, though I still keep it on the masthead, takes its distance from the earlier phase of critical theory. No revolution in the nineteenth-century historical sense is to be expected here. Social critici~<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Some of the goals in SPEP's founding included providing occasions for presenting papers and carrying out formal and informal discussions as well as making opportunities for the formation of collegiality among philosophers from many different schools in the context of the phenomenological/existential traditions. They also included the crucial development of book series and journals for the publication of new work and translations of German and French works in these traditions. The German heritage, especially in the context of SPEP, brought with it an emphasis on the importance of the history of philosophy that was unique in the professional atmosphere in philosophy in the United States at that time. That heritage taught that Kant's work, for example, had significance that exceeded considerably part 1 of
         The Critique of Pure Reason. Plato, Aristotle, medieval thought, Hegel, and many other nineteenth-century German philosophers were part of the phenomenological canon in 1961, in addition to the modern period that analytic philosophers regularly taught. The European tradition that arrived in North America recognized those philosophers in the Western tradition as alive in contemporary thought, as distinct to being relics in a theoretical museum with the quaint name of the History of Philosophy. An inherent intention in SPEP's founding was to introduce phenomenology and existential thought to academics and intellectuals in this country and to make that introduction in the context of the history of Western philosophy.<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: SPEP in particular and Continental philosophy in the United States generally were first nourished in originally religious and theological soil. That the papers delivered in the first five years, from 1962 to 1967, show nothing of the sort is actually a part of my thesis.
            
                  Contemporary Continental philosophy emerged under what John Wild called in 1955 “the breakdown of modern philosophy”:3
               
                  the discontent with the epistemologies of the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the critique of metaphysics in the wake of Kant, the critique of Hegel launched by the Kierkegaardian pseudonyms, the popularity of existentialism. None of this need necessarily have anything to do with theology, but it did, and that is because this discontent with modernity found an especially receptive audience among people who—like the founders of SPEP—were either theologically minded philosophers outright or philosophers who having been theologically minded had given it up and were looking for a successor form of thinking to their theological interests. The significant thing is not so much that they gave up theology, which they did in varying degrees, but that in looking for a successor form they turned to Continental philosophy. If they turned to Anglo-American sources, they embraced not the then regnant Anglo-American analytic and positivistic philosophies but, rather, classical American thinkers such as William James or Whitehead's process philosophy (theology). One reason for this is the “E” in SPEP, the question of philosophy as an “existential” matter, a matter of personal passion, a form of life. Let us briefly consider the Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish sources of SPEP.4<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: Hermeneutics, moreover, challenges the central role that Husserl ascribes to intuition, especially in his early works. The call to return to the things themselves is heeded by a return to what is given in intuition. But, as Ricoeur puts it, “the Husserlian demand for the return to intuition is countered by the necessity for all understanding to be mediated by an interpretation.”
         
               In support of this claim, Ricoeur draws inspiration from Heidegger's conception of the as-structure of being, which maintains that being is always revealed in a partial manner, as this or as that.13
            
               This as-structure suggests that nothing is ever directly or fully given, and for this reason, what is given always calls for a process of interpretation enabling it to be seen as this or that. If it is the case that all givenness is perspectival and partial, Ricoeur contends that phenomenology “cannot constitute itself without a14
            hermeneutical presupposition. The hermeneutical condition of phenomenology is linked to the role ofAuslegungin the fulfillment of its philosophical project.”

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The enormity of a particular exigence may be such that one of the only tropes capable of communicating the incommunicable is the one that so adamantly risks miscommunication. Hyperbole stirs one's emotions through the convergence of power and luminosity in a transcendental display of immanental insight that extends beyond the purview of logic and reason, thereby creating the intensity of
         vertige de l'hyperbole, which threatens to dismantle conventions of reason and rationality. Revealing that reason is madness and madness is reason through its “mad audacity,” this vertigo is precisely the disorienting crux of hyperbole's function of expressing the inexpressible and momentarily suspending presuppositions before they are re-oriented toward daring phenomenological and psychological reformulations.<br>

Abstract: Two spaces of interface stand out specifically: an interest in interpretation and a commitment to understanding human action. Generally speaking, Ricoeur's foundations in philosophical hermeneutics resonate with inquiries in rhetoric, and his deft balance of analytic and Continental approaches to philosophy provides a sensible perspective on the processes of textual interpretation. Ricoeur's work attends to concerns that might be described by some rhetorical scholars as “traditional” while also taking seriously the challenges that poststructural critiques pose to such concerns (see Ihde 2007, xvi, and Ricoeur
         1977, 257–313). For this reason, Ricoeur's scholarship provides a sensible point of mediation between views on language and human agency that can tend toward the extremes.<br>

Abstract: In this connection, two additional Ricoeurian points are worth emphasizing. First, Shaw does not present incontestable evidence to warrant his assertion that we exit the womb untarnished. And there is a good reason for this omission. No such corroboration exists, either in speculative thought or actual experience. Shaw knows this, even if he does not explicitly cite Kant on the limits of human knowledge. For this reason, he couches his deepest feelings about the sanctity of creation and the purity of nascence in terms of a “frame of reference”
         
               —what we may call faith—without which our lives could easily be an endless nightmare of unrelieved pessimism. Shaw may enlist Paley and the elaborate inner workings of the famous watch to proffer the notion that there is a designer behind all of the intricate design we see in nature, but he is well aware that while argument by analogy is suggestive, it is not necessarily irrefutable.48
            
               After all, given enough time, the counterargument goes, blind chance could have achieved the exact same results many are anxious to attribute to divine intelligence. For Shaw, then, the extrapolated likeness between the maker of a timepiece and the maker of a universe, with respect to complexity, organization, and purpose, does not constitute a rigorous proof. Nevertheless, it does provide him with sufficient grounds for a rational belief in things unseen. Shaw designates his ethereal architect the Life Force and equates it with Will, Spirit, and the mainspring of life, Creative Evolution. On this faith-based view, Shaw defines the Life Force and its ends as the paramount “good” in the ethical sense and conceives every newborn as similarly good because it comes into being already gifted with a subset of the same Will, Spirit, and Creativity that animates the world. From this angle, we can justifiably say that both Ricoeur and Shaw ground their abiding faith and the hope that flows from it in t~<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Although Burke had not read Bloch when he formulated his theory of dialectical-rhetorical transcendence, the similarities between the two theorists are remarkable. In particular, both Burke and Bloch emphasize the important role that art and creative letters play in this function of utopia/transcendent rhetoric. For Burke, there are two ways that political and social opposition can be transcended. One, which he says is exemplified by Mannheim, would still think in politically partisan terms. The other is Burke's own reinvention of Plato's dialectical process as an interpretive and generative tool. This way would transcend political partisanship at the level of poetic myth: Myth bursts into the discourse to reveal something out of the ordinary context, and we move beyond the limitations of reason into the potentialities of imagination. He illustrates this process with a reading of Castiglione's
         The Courtier. “By gradations,” writes Burke, “it builds a ladder of courtship dialectically, into a grand design that, in its ultimate stage, would transcend the social mystery, ending Platonically on a mystic, mythic vision of celestial mystery.”
               The handbook is usually studied as a book of manners, but Burke suggests that it had a strong rhetorical influence—perhaps a utopian-rhetorical influence—on the motives of Elizabethan poets and other courtiers of the period. The ultimate aim seems to be merging as closely with the ideal of a perfect courtier as possible and then to become the instructor of a prince (Aristotle and Alexander are cited as examples of this motive).34<br>

Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This may be one reason why, when Wells attempts to elaborate a Utopian vision directly out of material human history, he ends up constructing a world closer to the dystopias of Huxley or Orwell. Published four years before
         A Modern Utopia, H. G. Wells'sAnticipations(1901) advances a much harsher perspective upon the future.Anticipationspredicts that the end of the twentieth century would witness the rise of “a naturally and informally organized, educated class … a New Republic dominating the world.”
               Wells's New Republic is no frozen Utopia: its founders “will not conceive of it as a millennial paradise, a blissful inconsequent stagnation, but as a world state of active … human beings.”31
            
               Yet this dynamic futurity seems starkly less heterogeneous than Wells's32
            Modern Utopia; his New Republic's approaches to the uneducable classes range from the eugenicist through to the genocidal: the New Republic “will tolerate no dark corners where the people of the Abyss may fester…. [I]t is their portion to die out and disappear.”
