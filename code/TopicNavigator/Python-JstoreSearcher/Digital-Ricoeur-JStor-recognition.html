  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: In the post-Cold War era, nationalism has finally come to be recognized as probably the most explosive political force of our century. However, this belated recognition—forced upon us by dramatic historical events such as the implosion of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia—in no way eliminates the need to reexamine the reasons behind the sustained failure of most Western social sciences to generate serious theoretical interest in a foremost historical phenomenon.² For the neglect-of-nationalism-problem has resulted in “the most striking example of a general failure among experts to anticipate social developments.”³<br>

  Abstract: I first encountered René Girard on entering the graduate program in Romance languages at Johns Hopkins University in 1960, just before the publication of
                     Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesquein 1961 brought him wide public recognition.¹ Although I was immediately struck by the power and range of his intellect, it was only with the appearance ofLa violence et le sacréin 1972 that I realized that his mimetic theory of desire was in fact the kernel of a radically new anthropology.²<br>

  Abstract: Truitt had breakthroughs in Tokyo, but they were hard won. Despite the professional recognition that Truitt achieved while she lived in Japan from 1964 to 1967, it was a time of deep isolation, sadness, and frustration with her studio practice. At the turn of the 1970s, Truitt looked back on the sculptures she made in Japan and found them “simply intelligent,” “lifeless,” and inconsistent with the conceptual thrust of her work since First — and in December 1971, she had the majority of these Japanese works destroyed, nineteen sculptures in all.¹ Yet, despite this iconoclasm, after Truitt returned to the United<br>

  Abstract: Tedlockʹs breakthrough—for which his essay, ʺOn the Translation of Style in Oral Narrativeʺ (1971), was a first declaration—involves a recognition of the full dynamics of voice in oral narration, along with the development of new means of transcription and translation to bring it across on the page and in performance. To do this, he typically uses line and stanza breaks to note the natural pauses ofallhuman speech, and he adapts such typographical devices as capital letters, reduced type-size, jagged lineation, and vowels followed by long dashes, to indicate such voice qualities as loudness, softness, (chanted) pitch<br>

  Abstract: Canto XXI is in many ways a canto of thresholds and surprises or, as William Stephany has emphasized, of conversions. These threshold crossings involve both poetic and religious issues, nor can the two ever be far apart for Dante. The canto, which introduces a major classical poet and discusses the influence of Virgil’s poetry, is also the first in which we meet a soul fully cleansed of sin and ready to ascend to Paradise. Beginning with the appearance of Statius and ending with his recognition of Virgil, this canto offers the last concentration on classical poetry before the series of<br>

  Abstract: In tracing out Heidegger’s thinking about place and “various phenomenal spatialities” such as region and neighborhood, we have pursued place into some of its more arcane corners and subtler surfaces. We have learned much about the panoply of meanings that place can exhibit as well as the range of roles it can assume in widely divergent contexts. If the effect is kaleidoscopic—leading us to savor place’s “free scope,” its
                  Zeit-Spiel-Raum—it has allowed us to recognize, indeed to re-recognize, the power of place. Earlier encomia of place (articulated at the moment of its dawning recognition in the West) tend<br>

  Abstract: “What happens now?” in modern parlance often means “What happens next?” This is not so much an error as it is a recognition of the centrality of a conception of the future, even an apocalyptic one, for any notion of the present.¹ We are accustomed to the notion that the present is always fleeting into the past or yearning for a better tomorrow, a nodal point defined via negation and ungraspable as such. This intuitive, geometric model of temporality is precisely what Milton and Marvell seek to unseat with their lyric presentations of an immanent apocalypse. To treat an eschatological<br>

  Abstract: An attempt to contribute to a “phenomenology of prayer” ought to begin with the recognition that the word “phenomenology” means many different things to many different people. Moreover, it must be recognized that none of these usages has any obvious claim to being the normative one. Given these inescapable facts, it is therefore incumbent on one who would make such a contribution to define just what it is that he or she might mean by “phenomenology.”<br>

  Abstract: As one of the last decisions before it disassembled for the summer break in 2008, the Danish Parliament,

As a condition for refuge in Denmark, however, any writer granted “refuge” under the umbrella of ICORN now has to sign a rather peculiar document—a “Declaration on recognition of the fundamental values of the Danish society” (cf.

  Author(s) RASCHKE CARL<br>
  Abstract: The work of Levinas attempts to give an account of the uniqueness of the human person, starting from what he believes to be peculiar to persons, the recognition of others as the source of moral obligation. This criterion had already been proposed in the literature of neo-Kantianism, but the formulation it received there had been found wanting. According to Heidegger, the neo-Kantian sees in the ethical a means for transcending human finitude: “There is something in the categorical imperative which exceeds the finite being.”¹ But for Heidegger the concept of the ethical can display itself only in relation to a<br>

  Abstract: That the House of Busirane, culmination of the 1590 edition of Spenser’s

The delay may testify to our distance from a deliberately, self-consciously rhetorical culture, even as its recognition suggests that this distance is not insurmountable.

  Abstract: Catholics have often struggled to achieve recognition in France as legitimate intellectuals with a distinctive voice and valuable ideas to contribute. To a large extent, this is a result of the difficult interface between religion and politics. However, key Catholic figures in the interwar period worked with great tenacity to address the problems and dilemmas that rendered the interface difficult, especially the tensions between the spiritual and temporal realms and between a long-term conception of civilization and short-term political objectives. In the process they developed a complex but workable concept of engagement, based on a notion of the human person,<br>

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

  Abstract: Over the past few decades the study of “John and Scripture” has been approached from a variety of perspectives and with a wide range of methodological tools. The textual form and function of the explicit quotations in John’s Gospel have, inevitably, received most attention to date, but a number of scholars are now venturing beyond the relative comfort zone of direct—and largely identifiable—quotations to explore the interpretative mechanisms at work within a narrative also saturated with a rich deposit of scriptural concepts and motifs.

  Abstract: The last few decades have witnessed a growing scholarly recognition of the contributions that the application of contemporary literary perspectives and conventions can make to biblical studies.¹ In particular, there has been a growing awareness of the value of intertextual study. For many scholars, the emphasis on intertextuality comes as a breath of fresh air. It is as though source criticism had done a cut and paste job on the Bible, subordinating the authority of some parts to others, denying the possibility of effectively interrelating even adjacent passages of Scripture.

  Abstract: The next three contributions explore the biological and ethological sources of musical meaning and affect.

This is the case for the recognition of tonality and tonal melodies, which are not merely sequences or successions of pitches. Being rooted in biological evolution, they can be linked to the transmission of meaning by establishing a kind of specific connection between perception of sounds, memory function and emotional assessment.

  Book Title: Mestizaje and Globalization-Transformations of Identity and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG PHILIP D.<br>
  Abstract: The Spanish word
      mestizajedoes not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.Mestizaje and Globalizationpresents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.Mestizaje and Globalizationcontributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.<br>

By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

                  descriptio, description), of people, places, buildings, works of art. Late antique and medieval poetry used it lavishly” (Curtis, 69). But, along with figurative language generally, it fell victim to the hostility toward classical rhetoric manifested by literary movements from romanticism to modernism. Indeed, one history of rhetoric still in use claims authoritatively: “ekphrasis . . . perverts descriptions because it frustrates narrative movement; [and] . . . confirms a decadent habit of literature” (Baldwin, 19).

  Book Title: Recognizing the Gift-Toward a Renewed Theology of Nature and Grace<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Rober Daniel A.<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the Gift puts twentieth-century Catholic theological conversations on nature and grace, particularly those of Henri de Lubac and Karl Rahner, into dialogue with Continental philosophy, notably the thought of Jean-Luc Marion and Paul Ricoeur. It argues that a renewed theology of nature and grace must build on the accomplishments of the recent past while acknowledging that an engagement with the political is unavoidable for theology. Ultimately, the aim is to revive and broaden discussion of nature and grace by drawing together the insights of contemporary theologians and Continental philosophers. Too often these areas of inquiry remain quite separate, in part due to differing priorities. This work tries to open that conversation, in part by critically pointing out, in dialogue with Ricoeur, the need in Marion’s work for an acknowledgment of recognition, reciprocity, and the political. It thus argues for a theology of nature and grace in terms of recognition of the gift, drawing out the reciprocal and political nature of gift and givenness in opposition to those, including Marion, who would seek to avoid politics and reciprocity as a proper avenue of inquiry for theology.<br>

  Abstract: The previous two chapters have raised the question of gift and recognition as a resource for the theology of nature and grace. Jean-Luc Marion’s careful analysis of the gift and the saturated phenomenon offers valuable insights while also making overtures to theology, but it falls short on some key points, particularly its denial of reciprocity and underdeveloped notion of recognition. Paul Ricoeur’s work, as I have explained, offers correctives to Marion’s by pairing a less-developed notion of gift with a stronger account of recognition and reciprocity. In the conclusion of the last chapter, I began to draw out how these<br>

  Book Title: Exodus and Resurrection-The God of Israel in the Theology of Robert W. Jenson<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Nicol Andrew W.<br>
  Abstract: Exodus and Resurrection establishes the important place God’s identity as the “God of Israel" has in the systematic theology of Robert W. Jenson. The work demonstrates that the identification of the God of Israel as the agent of Jesus’ resurrection functions as a foundational premise in Jenson’s Trinitarian theology. Andrew W. Nicol argues that a central characteristic of Jenson’s work is not merely his recognition that the same God who rescued Israel from Egypt raised Jesus from the dead, or the related yet distinct step of renovating his theology in a nonsupersessionist fashion, but also his attempt to conceive of the full implications for doing so in Christian theology, in the church’s self-understanding, and in the church’s relation to Israel and continuing Judaism. In this, Exodus and Resurrection provides a clear and critically appreciative account of Robert W. Jenson’s work and offers a new vital architectonic map of Jenson’s systematic vision.<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Abstract: As has been suggested above, the concept of

First recovered in the 1930s, the political dimension of the concept would not be systematically explored until the early 1990s, with the publication of third-generation Frankfurt School theorist Axel Honneth’sThe Struggle for Recognition: The Moral Grammar of Social Conflicts(1992), and of Hegel-influenced philosopher Charles Taylor’sMulticulturalism: Examining the Politics of Recognition(1992).

  Abstract: My subject is public history, history outside the academy, linking historians to the broad population interested – sometimes passionately interested – in historical inquiry. Public history is defined by this extension of the domain within which the scholar operates. The audience for historical literature defines the discipline as much as the professional credentials of the practitioner. Public history is thus an attempt to flee from the increasing specialisation and decreasing readership of professional academic work, both in journals and in monograph form.

They identify and describe a Canadian civic philosophy and attempt to show how thismodus operandiof Canadian public life is capable of reconciling questions of collective identity and recognition with a commitment to individual rights and related principles of liberal democracy. They further argue that this philosophy can serve as a model for nations around the world faced with internal complexities and growing demands for recognition from populations more diverse than at any previous time in their histories.<br>

The latter approach has been developed further by Axel Honneth, who proposes a ‘theory of recognition’, and whose work descends from the tradition of the Frankfurt School. Is critique, first and foremost, an achievement of ‘ordinary’ actors or a task of theory? What is the relationship between theory and<br>

  Author(s) Clark Peter Yuichi<br>
  Abstract: So begins the book of Lamentations (1:1), written following the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem (586 BCE) and arguably one of the clearest expressions of trauma literature in the Hebrew Bible. The image of the isolated and bereaved woman, violated, degraded, lacking anyone to comfort her, represents well the traumatic impact of war and devastation. Metaphorically rich, this personification of the city as woman—Daughter Zion—holds in tension both the personal, individual reality of suffering and a recognition of communal suffering.<br>

  Abstract: There have been many recent theological attempts to argue for a more holistic anthropology than that which substance-dualism has traditionally provided.¹ The proponents of holistic anthropology have several motives—an increased recognition of the importance of the body,² a respect for scientific research that points towards physicalism,³ and a desire to reflect biblical anthropology,⁴ for example. However, the desire for a more holistic anthropology, whether of the materialist or non-reductive physicalist variety, is also motivated by a theological suspicion of split-ness itself.

  Abstract: Paradoxically, despite the fact that contemporary society is commonly conceptualized as “terminally ill with amnesia” (Huyssen 1995, 1), memory has established itself as a major discourse; interest in memory in the last thirty years has been unprecedented. This interest accounts for the discovery of ethnic and local roots as well as for the construction of common pasts to bind communities and give meaning to their collective fates. The intensification of a memory discourse can be illustrated by the epidemics of public commemoration, the growing recognition of memory as both a constitutive component of political culture and an important base of<br>

  Author(s) WERPEHOWSKI WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: It would be impossible to tell the history of modern Christian ethics without paying attention to the ways in which the realities of diversity have shaped its concerns. In a theological register, responses to these realities have run the gamut from lamenting an existential threat to celebrating a providential gift. Biblical narratives, from Babel to Pentecost, are marshaled for each approach (cf., e.g., Gen. 11; Rom. 12; 1 Cor. 12; Rev. 7). What cannot be denied is the extent to which recognition of diversity has sponsored and determined much of the intellectual agenda of the discipline known as “Christian ethics.”<br>

It is easy to miss the pale script spelling out “Lots Frau” in the painting’s lower right-hand corner; yet, without it, the work hardly bears relation to either Sodom’s biblical account or the art-historical archive.

Apart from this information, there is an accumulation of discursive constructions in which the deaths of people are used in media images and political discourses in order to endorse a given logic or strategy in the battle for recognition and power. However, the statement of passage from life to death is more than a referential base. It is a way of reinstating an ethic of recognizing the Other.

  Book Title: The Priority of Injustice-Locating Democracy in Critical Theory<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Doshi Sapana<br>
  Abstract: Debates about radical democracy, Barnett argues, have become trapped around a set of oppositions between deliberative and agonistic theories-contrasting thinkers who promote the possibility of rational agreement and those who seek to unmask the role of power or violence or difference in shaping human affairs. While these debates are often framed in terms of consensus versus contestation, Barnett unpacks the assumptions about space and time that underlie different understandings of the sources of political conflict and shows how these differences reflect deeper philosophical commitments to theories of creative action or revived ontologies of "the political." Rather than developing ideal theories of democracy or models of proper politics, he argues that attention should turn toward the practices of claims-making through which political movements express experiences of injustice and make demands for recognition, redress, and re pair. By rethinking the spatial grammar of discussions of public space, democratic inclusion, and globalization, Barnett develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the crucial roles played by geographical processes in generating and processing contentious politics.<br>

  Abstract: Defining medicine as a discipline and as a profession, requires a recognition that it comprises theory, and not merely practice.¹ The conceptualization of suffering and disease in secular terms, for example, has been one of the most pervasive theoretical aims of medicine throughout history. In addition, as a proto-paradigmatic discipline, medicine has been influenced by the science of the positivistic era, which may be said to have the inherent goal of reproducing itself and achieving autonomy as a techno-scientific enterprise. Therefore, as a scientific discipline, modern medicine shares with the sciences the goals of innovation and invention, aside from its<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Nature-Hope at the Heart of Ecological Loss and Grief<br>

  Abstract: We are facing unprecedented environmental challenges, including global climate change, large-scale industrial development, rapidly increasing species extinction, ocean acidification, and deforestation – challenges that require new vocabularies and new ways to express grief and sorrow over the disappearance, degradation, and loss of nature. Seeking to redress the silence around ecologically based anxiety in academic and public domains, and to extend the concepts of sadness, anger, and loss, Mourning Nature creates a lexicon for the recognition and expression of emotions related to environmental degradation. Exploring the ways in which grief is experienced in numerous contexts, this groundbreaking collection draws on classical, philosophical, artistic, and poetic elements to explain environmental melancholia. Understanding that it is not just how we mourn but what we mourn that defines us, the authors introduce new perspectives on conservation, sustainability, and our relationships with nature. An ecological elegy for a time of climatic and environmental upheaval, Mourning Nature challenges readers to turn devastating events into an opportunity for positive change. Contributors include Glenn Albrecht (Murdoch University, retired); Jessica Marion Barr (Trent University); Sebastian Braun (University of North Dakota); Ashlee Cunsolo (Labrador Institute of Memorial University); Amanda Di Battista (York University); Franklin Ginn (University of Edinburgh); Bernie Krause (soundscape ecologist, author, and independent scholar); Lisa Kretz (University of Evansville); Karen Landman (University of Guelph); Patrick Lane (Poet); Andrew Mark (independent scholar); Nancy Menning (Ithaca College); John Charles Ryan (University of New England); Catriona Sandilands (York University); and Helen Whale (independent scholar).We are facing unprecedented environmental challenges, including global climate change, large-scale industrial development, rapidly increasing species extinction, ocea~<br>

  Book Title: Desi Divas-Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Desi Divas: Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performancesis the product of five years of field research with progressive activists associated with the School for Indian Languages and Cultures (SILC), South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), the feminist dance collective Post Natyam, and the grassroots feminist political organization South Asian Sisters. Christine L. Garlough explores how traditional cultural forms may be critically appropriated by marginalized groups and used as rhetorical tools to promote deliberation and debate, spur understanding and connection, broaden political engagement, and advance particular social identities. Within this framework she examines how these performance activists advocate a political commitment to both justice and care, to both deliberative discussion and deeper understanding. To consider how this might happen in diasporic performance contexts, Garlough weaves together two lines of thinking. One grows from feminist theory and draws upon a core literature concerning the ethics of care. The other comes from rhetoric, philosophy, and political science literature on recognition and acknowledgment. This dual approach is used to reflect upon South Asian American women's performances that address pressing social problems related to gender inequality, immigration rights, ethnic stereotyping, hate crimes, and religious violence.<br>

  Abstract: When one thinks of western films, certain stock characters come to mind. Cowboys, Indians, gunslingers, and homesteaders are some of the obvious examples. However, there is a character that is as—perhaps even more—elemental to the western: the horse. Horses are everywhere in westerns. Our heroes ride in—and out—on them. And yet, who thinks about them? In recent decades, increased scholarly attention has been paid to marginalized figures in literature and mainstream media.

  Abstract: In the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand became a British colony and the Maori people, together with their lands and estates, were given Crown protection as well as the rights and privileges of British subjects. In 1975, the New Zealand Parliament, for the first time since 1840, gave statutory recognition to the Treaty by setting up a tribunal to hear claims by Maori people that the Crown had failed to honour its guarantees under the Treaty. Claims lodged since then have been made mostly by kin-based tribal groups. They depend heavily on recitals of history, tradition and<br>

  Abstract: FROM THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY and the first scholarly recognition of oral tradition as a cultural process, there has been a concomitant concern among students of language and expressive culture with the transformative effects of new technologies of communication on oral performance. One facet of the problem that has concerned scholars of oral narrative from the Brothers Grimm to the theorists of ethnopoetics and the orality-literacy debates is the process of remediation, specifically, the rendering of face-to-face performance forms through the mediation of another communicative technology.¹ What happens when we render oral stories in writing?

Or rather, I suppose I should say, the one grand cultural and historical narrative that we as modern persons tend to share, and that most sharply distinguishes a modern from a premodern vision of society, is the story of liberation, the story of the ascent of the individual out of the shadows of hierarchy and subsidiary identity into the light of full recognition, dignity, and autonomy.

  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer begins the chapter in

Rambach’s definition of hermeneutics as tripartite, as asubtilitas intelligendi, explicandi, applicandi, or subtlety in knowing, interpreting, and applying. What is essential in this stipulation of application as faculty are the recognition of the interpreter as agent and the focus on the activity of inquiry: not only does the sense of the object text find its full and concrete form only in interpretation but the interpreter of the text is part of the<br>

  Abstract: If anything is universal in philosophical hermeneutics, it is probably the recognition of one’s own finitude, the consciousness that actual speech does not suffice to exhaust the inner conversation that impels us toward understanding. Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

  Author(s) Bahloul Joëlle<br>
  Abstract: Judaism and Islam are mutually recognized as genuine monotheisms. Despite this general recognition, Muslim and Jewish religious scholars have critiqued each others’ religion over the centuries by calling into question both the authenticity of the other’s scripture and the efficacy of its religious practice. This basic critique is quite similar on both sides, yet despite significant and sometimes severe disapproval, each party recognizes the essential theological and moral- ethical soundness of the other. This basic respect, though sometimes reluctant, does not apply equally to other religions, certainly not to the Oriental traditions, and for the most part, not even Christianity.¹<br>

  Abstract: In two texts written 50 years apart, Erikson (1972: 274) and Bauman (2003) both attribute the relatively recent preoccupation with identity processes to the great economic and social transformations which destroyed community life, made subjects and families culturally vulnerable and created mounting internal and international migratory fluxes which temporarily increased tolerance to uncertainties (Appadurai 1998). Erikson developed his cluster of identity concepts within a relatively closed community, based on intergenerational recognition, and characterised by an antagonistic exteriority that conveniently sanctioned its relative closure. On the other hand, Bauman (2003: 16) theorises on community fixation, in line with Fromm (1941), less<br>

Typically played out within modern territorial states, arguments about justice were assumed to concern relations among fellow citizens, to be subject to debate within national publics, and to contemplate redress by national states. This was true for each of two major families of justice claims: claims for socioeconomic redistribution and claims for legal or cultural recognition.

But life writing also plays a part in the making of what I call “companionable objects”—those things with which we have ethical and affective ties.

Instead, he can be aligned with his contemporary, Émile Benveniste, as well as current linguists such as George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, who have emphasized discourse over language.

The main reason for this oversight has two complementary facets: Hobson’s contribution lay chiefly in his formulation of a liberal version of British welfare thought, an ideological genre that until recently was accorded insufficient recognition; and, conversely, recourse to conventional modes of political theorising, utilising existing traditions, or referring to the constructs of leading individuals, was not paramount in his work.

  Abstract: With an original combination of close reading and political theory, Joy Connolly argues that Cicero, Sallust, and Horace inspire fresh thinking about central concerns of contemporary political thought and action. These include the role of conflict in the political community, especially as it emerges from class differences; the necessity of recognition for an equal and just society; the corporeal and passionate aspects of civic experience; citizens' interdependence on one another for senses of selfhood; and the uses and dangers of self-sovereignty and fantasy. Putting classicists and political theorists in dialogue, the book also addresses a range of modern thinkers, including Kant, Hannah Arendt, Stanley Cavell, and Philip Pettit. Together, Connolly's readings construct a new civic ethos of advocacy, self-criticism, embodied awareness, imagination, and irony.<br>

  Abstract: Merleau-Ponty offers us an existentialist philosophy that understands our freedom and responsibility as inseparable from our embodiment. Though he does not explicitly and systematically articulate an ethics, his notion of embodiment nonetheless implies a certain existentialist ethics. For, according to Merleau-Ponty, to be embodied is to be inherently in relation to others, and thus, as I will argue, it is to be implicated in and moved by an imperative to strive for mutual recognition. This paper seeks to elucidate this embodied ethics of mutual recognition.<br>

  Book Title: Ethics of Catholicism and the Consecration of the Intellectual-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): BÉLANGER ANDRÉ J.<br>
  Abstract: Using France as the most representative case of a Catholic context, Bélanger argues that as French society became more secularized intellectuals replaced the clergy as arbitrators of justice and enlightenment. Catholic morality was consolidated by the scholastic tradition and confirmed by the Counter-Reformation, providing the foundation that allowed the establishment of a lay elite. Bélanger describes the progressive takeover of positions of influence by the new elite in Catholic society and examines arguments used by thinkers from the seventeenth to the twentieth century to legitimize their positions. In contrast, the Anglo-Saxon Protestant tradition, due to its emphasis on the priesthood of all believers, led to recognition of the individual's conscience as the sole judge of her or his deeds and failed to provide intellectuals with the basis for any claim to serve as moral leaders in political affairs.<br>

His thought, though focused on body parts, voices Daisy’s understanding of the quest for indirect access, for the mirror that allows moments of glancing recognition through the darkness that hides us from ourselves.<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1960s, social ethics has assumed increasing importance in the theological education, pastoral practice, and ministry of the Christian churches. One of the reasons for this development is the recognition that in the past the churches tended to identify themselves, consciously or unconsciously, with the societies in which they lived and, more especially, with the ruling powers or dominant ideologies. Although individual Christians and critical Christian movements gave prophetic witness in their societies, the churches as a whole tended to remain silent in the face of the injustices practised by their societies. Today, their behaviour is much different.<br>

  Abstract: Having established the CFLN and the Provisional Consultative Assembly to help him debate both wartime strategy and post-war planning, Charles de Gaulle waited through the winter of 1943–44 in Algiers to be invited to London to join in devising Allied strategy for the liberation of France. Much time was spent during these months in vain efforts to secure formal recognition of the CFLN by the Allies. Thanks to the unbudging antipathy of Roosevelt to de Gaulle and to the growing bitterness of Churchill toward what he saw to be the general’s increasingly perfidious behaviour, this diplomatic acceptance would not<br>

  Abstract: Academic postcolonialism has generally neglected to address the politics of reconciliation, despite the recent emergence of reconciliation political programs and movements in a wide range of national and international contexts. However, one obligation of postcolonial work is to “fully recognize” what Gyan Prakash refers to as “another history of agency and knowledge alive in the dead weight of the colonial past.”¹ This task of recognition necessitates understanding acts of anti-colonial dissent not only as theorizable but as fully productive, conceptually constructive theoretical “events” in their own right.

  Book Title: Walking with the Mud Flower Collective-God's Fierce Whimsy and Dialogic Theological Method<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Jost Stina Busman<br>
  Abstract: Arguing for a retrieval of the landmark work, God’s Fierce Whimsy, Stina Busman Jost establishes the critical importance of this volume for the construction of a dialogic theological method. This is accomplished through a close reading of God’s Fierce Whimsy in which the author identifies key methodological characteristics informing the volume’s formation. Critical importance also is established through interviews with the volume’s authors, the Mud Flower Collective—which included Katie G. Cannon, Beverly W. Harrison, Carter Heyward, Ada María Isasi-Díaz, Bess B. Johnson (Delores Williams), Mary D. Pellauer, and Nancy D. Richardson. Undergirding this endeavor is a recognition of the theoretical importance of difference to the project of theological construction and the vital form of the dialogic as constitutive of theological practice; this is carried forward through engagement with the pivotal theorists Martin Buber and Mikhail Bakhtin, who helped pioneer the philosophical and literary critical importance of otherness, difference, and dialogue. Finally, the author constructively engages recent developments in feminist theologies and postcolonial theories—ultimately making the argument that a dialogic theological method is relevant for the doing of theology today.<br>

John Lippitt has argued, on the other hand, that an important feature of selfhood is the recognition that life resists narrative (2007: 45). In other words, Rudd claims it is<br>

If this element of language has aroused such interest, it is because there has been increasing recognition that all of our concepts are framed within metaphorical terms. Rather than a model of language based upon the linguistic sign (a model which implies that words designate things in the world outside of language), linguists today are more inclined to accept that there exists a figurative substructure to concepts. This in turn helps us to understand that concepts are not extra-lingual<br>

The new South Africa's confrontation of this dilemma is Martin J. Murray's subject in

The inheritance of existential phenomenology in the work of Bazin and others includes a romantic recognition of the human gesture—a confidence in cinema to transmit directly the experience traced in faces and gestures.

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

                     Herrschaftssoziologie) and the Marxist critique of capitalism (Legitimation;Rekonstruktion). Legitimacy, as he has defined it, means the “worthiness of recognition [Anerkennungswürdigkeit] of a political order” (Rekonstruktion, 271).Legitimation Crisis, which dates from this period, focuses on the production of meaning (and crises of meaning) within the capitalist system—when the administration can shoulder economic problems but can no longer account for its operations (Legitimation, 98).<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Allen Amy<br>
  Abstract: During the twentieth century, the view that assertions and norms are valid insofar as they respond to principles independent of all local and temporal contexts came under attack from two perspectives: the partiality of translation and the intersubjective constitution of the self, understood as responsive to recognition. Defenses of universalism have by and large taken the form of a thinning out of substantive universalism into various forms of proceduralism.<br>

  Abstract: In 1952, when Frantz Fanon’s 
                  Black Skin, White Masks was published, a new era was already beginning in the discussion of race.¹ For the first time in more than 150 years, the dominant discourse about race was no longer under the dark shadow of racial science. It was now governed by a growing recognition of the evils of racism. One sees this most notably in the UNESCO declaration on race, which was authored primarily by Ashley Montagu yet with the signatures of other anthropologists (most notably Claude Lévi-Strauss and E. Franklin Frazier) attached. Together they called for “an ethic of<br>

  Abstract: Patricia McAnany has observed that creating a “genealogy of place” has been of historic concern to Maya communities. The establishment and recognition of land rights, in both colonial- and modern-era Yucatán, seems to have involved questions of inheritance, habitual encroachment, or primary occupancy. McAnany has suggested that similar ideas existed in pre-Hispanic times, with the “principle of first occupancy” defining lineage customs and conflicts in the Classic Maya lowlands. In essence, the first individuals to colonize a given area gain permanent ownership of the best agricultural lands; families who arrive later are forced to either fight for decent arable land<br>

  Abstract: In
      Mourning in America, McIvor addresses significant and urgent questions about how citizens can mourn traumatic events and enduring injustices in their communities. McIvor offers a framework for analyzing the politics of mourning, drawing from psychoanalysis, Greek tragedy, and scholarly discourses on truth and reconciliation.Mourning in Americaconnects these literatures to ongoing activism surrounding racial injustice, and it contextualizes Black Lives Matter in the broader politics of grief and recognition. McIvor also examines recent, grassroots-organized truth and reconciliation processes such as the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2004-2006), which provided a public examination of the Greensboro Massacre of 1979-a deadly incident involving local members of the Communist Workers Party and the Ku Klux Klan.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I begin to sketch out in more detail the constitutive aspects of what I am calling the democratic work of mourning. The democratic work of mourning involves the public spaces and practices by which the traumas of collective life are publicly worked through in ways that enliven social struggles for recognition while mitigating denial, disavowal, and distrust. In articulating this concept, I lean heavily on the work of object relations psychoanalysis and, in particular, the approach to mourning found in Melanie Klein and D. W. Winnicott.

  Book Title: Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age-Eros, Eris and Empire<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: This work engages with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial 'home' space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet's sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. But the primary commitment of the book is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Góngora and Quevedo), this study disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the 'epistemic break', often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation. Isabel Torres is Professor of Spanish Golden Age Literature and Head of Spanish and Portuguese Studies at Queen's University, Belfast.<br>

  Book Title: War and Literature-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Ian<br>
  Abstract: War was the first subject of literature; at times, war has been its only subject. In this volume, the contributors reflect on the uneasy yet symbiotic relations of war and writing, from medieval to modern literature. War writing emerges in multiple forms, celebratory and critical, awed and disgusted; the rhetoric of inexpressibility fights its own battle with the urgent necessity of representation, record and recognition. This is shown to be true even to the present day: whether mimetic or metaphorical, literature that concerns itself overtly or covertly with the real pressures of war continues to speak to issues of pressing significance. Particular topics addressed include writings of and about the Crusades and battles during the Hundred Years War; Shakespeare's "Casus Belly"; Auden's "Journal of an Airman"; and War and Peace.

  Abstract: In this article I examine the place of religious beliefs, and the interrelation between religion and gender, in a selection of twenty-first-century German-language prose fiction written by women. In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Abstract: While Patten’s treatment of these issues is quite cogent, his work on Hegel falters at points. His argument relies at one stage on making sense of Hegelian “concrete universality,” but Patten seems impatient with the task of explaining it and neglects to grapple with Hegel’s logic. And because Patten places inadequate emphasis on the role of mutual recognition in Hegel’s social philosophy, he develops a reading of Hegel that, while appealing, is excessively individualistic, both in general and specifically in the case of Hegel.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: While Ricoeur suggests that recourse to solidarity can go too far in answering these questions, an appeal to the conditions of solidarity provides the basis for his criticism of Rawls. As his account of the subject of rights would suggest, and agreeing with many in the Anglo‐American world, Ricoeur denies that a procedural theory of justice can substitute for the bonds of an ethical community or replace a collective conception of the good. At the same time, he sees Rawls’s analysis as a brilliant articulation of the deontological level of the structure of moral action. For Ricoeur, Rawls’s revisions of his theory of justice in his later work mark his own recognition of the connection between the deontological and teleological levels of moral action since he now explicitly grounds the theory of justice in a particular sort of political community.<br>

Abstract: The second reason for adopting Kuhns notion is that it is intimately tied to the question of (in)commensurability. I found this idea appealing because I had been feeling for quite some time that, once we start digging deeper, we might find considerable disagreement among colleagues on what constitutes an appropriate way of studying language from an anthropological perspective. It was the hidden incommensurability that I found interesting and tried to make explicit. Pace Rumseys reading, I never suggested that we should be looking for one shared or
         Urparadigm or that differences could be easily reconciled. Perhaps my call for a dialogue at the end of the article was misplaced and potentially misleading. I should then qualify it by saying that the call was never meant as a call for an ecumenical outcome. I take dialogue to mean the possibility of understanding, which may imply the recognition (as well as the achievement) of either agreement or disagreement.<br>

Abstract: The Glorious Revolution was, Neal says, “a wonderful revolution” not least because it was “effected with little or no effusion of blood.” However, Neal’s account is critical of its outcomes, ascribed to the baleful role of high churchmen. The latter’s threat to separate in large numbers from a reformed church of England brought to an end all negotiations and all former promises of a comprehension and an unrestricted toleration. The Nonconformists were betrayed by the latitudinarians within the church in order to conciliate their shared enemies. They were, Neal protests, “sold to the Jacobites, by the timorousness of their Friends.”
      46An Act of Toleration was passed that removed some of the legislation against them, but they remained unexcepted from the Test and Corporation Acts and excluded from the universities. Indeed, had it been left to the High Church Tories, there would have been no Act of Toleration and a rapid return to the severities of the Stuart regime:
            On this disappointed and bitter notesuch was the ungrateful Return that these stubborn Churchmen made to those who assisted them in their Distress! For it ought to stand upon Record, that the Church of England had been twice rescued from the most imminent Danger by Men of those very Principles for whose Satisfaction they would not move a Pin or abate a Ceremony; first in the year 1660, when the Presbyterians restored the King and Constitution without making any Terms for themselves; and now again at the Revolution of King William, when the Church fled for Succour to a Presbyterian Prince, and was delivered by an Army of fourteen thousand Hollanders of the same Principles with the English Dissenters; but how uncivilly those Troops were used afterwards, is too ungrateful a Piece of History to remember.

Abstract: If I must pause here, at the threshold of a subject that would appear to be of less than universal current interest—composition pedagogy—it is in the recognition that the subject of composition, how to compose one’s thoughts and words, was the greater part of education from antiquity to the nineteenth century. What we call expository writing, the one‐ or two‐course sequence that our university students are everywhere compelled to take, is only an echo of this immemorial “method of tradition.” The failure to reduce writing to method in our modern post‐Ramistic sense, to a quasi‐science of transmission, is related to the larger failure, perhaps the necessary failure, of modern educational theory to bring communication within the system of the disciplines, as both object of knowledge and means of transmitting knowledge. In this postrhetorical condition, information technologies proliferate with familiar paradoxical effects, such as the degradation in the communicative efficacy of writing lamented by Tufte and Lanham. Without falling back upon a narrative of decline, which would in any case concede a failure of historical understanding, I conclude on the threshold of a second question, much larger than that of composition pedagogy in the contemporary university. On this threshold, I envision, or call for (in the spirit of my epigraph from Bacon) an inquiry into the question of why writing has remained the indispensable “art of transmission” in the era of technologically mediated information.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-2<br>
Date: 04 2005<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: An increase in knowledge and religious sensitivity has thus revealed the representations of the religious “other” in opposition to which Christianity has traditionally defined itself to be little more than projections of an underlying desire to establish religious identity.
         59Thoughtful comparison exposes this basic need to establish religious identity by invalidating many of the representations through which this need has been at once expressed and concealed. We might say that comparative theology represents the demythologization of apologetics, where demythologization is understood in Rudolf Bultmann’s sense as the recognition of an expressive function underneath an appearance of objective description. So just as Bultmann sought to demythologize the New Testament by explicating the mode of being‐in‐the‐world expressed through a mythical world picture,60so too the comparative theologian recognizes the expressive intent beneath the often questionable comparisons of traditional apologetics. The analogy with Bultmann’s demythologization project calls attention to a point about this conception of comparative theology that brings it into line with Clooney’s, namely, that it does not imply an outright rejection of apologetics. Comparative theology can be regarded as the attempt to salvage what is legitimate in apologetics, namely, the desire to preserve the integrity of a particular religious community by establishing its cognitive boundaries. This conception of comparative theology as a demythologized apologetics thus acknowledges the legitimacy of a sociopolitical dimension to religion. Through judicious comparisons, comparative theology brings into relief the defining features of the Christian community. Yet this aspect of comparative theology differs from traditional apologetics in that it distinguishes a desire to define the Christian faith from a perceived need to refute the teachings of other faith communities. To the extent that comparative theology succ~<br>

Abstract: What’s the difference between a “limit” and a “boundary,” and does it make a difference? Does it matter, for example, that
      Grenzenin the title of Immanuel Kant’s major work on the philosophy of religion,Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, is perhaps better translated as “boundaries” and not as “limits”? According to Patrick Bourgeois’s recent book,Philosophy at the Boundary of Reason: Ethics and Postmodernity, much hangs on this distinction. The book pursues three interlocking agendas, each concerning themes of interest to scholars of religion and ethics. The author’s primary agenda is to draw attention to what he sees as a neglected philosophical distinction within the Kantian critical philosophy crucial to a proper interpretation of the notion of the “limit‐boundary of reason” and to the ruinous effects the failure to apprehend this distinction unleashed within twentieth‐century philosophy. Second, he pursues an important new reading of Paul Ricoeur as a philosopher who gets the idea of the limit‐boundary of reason right in his hermeneutical phenomenology. Finally, Bourgeois tries to show how getting the distinction right makes it possible to extricate the positive elements of postmodern ethics (especially Emmanuel Lévinas’s recognition of the ethical claim of alterity) from deconstruction’s false philosophy of limit as closure. In Bourgeois’s view, deconstruction decenters meaning and subjectivity to so large a degree as to render responsible human agency ineffectual.<br>

Abstract: Meyers is not so naive as to hold that careful screening and imaginative trope play will automatically yield a liberatory model of individual agency. She insists that the self‐figurations that “survive this vetting must become embedded in the cognitive, emotional, and corporeal structures that shape agency and that function as criteria of self‐appraisal. To agentically integrate dissident self‐figurations, women must command skills that enable them to invest emotionally in these tropes and to reconfigure their embodied values as well as their patterns of thought and volition in accordance with them” (55). How? Partly through changes in child‐rearing practices and the social order more generally, but Meyers’s view presumes that the skills for emotional investment and revision of values and volition are already available to most women. However, it can be argued that many women lack these skills and find it arduous to embed new figurations in their cognitive, emotional, and corporeal selves. It is hard to see how any amount of screening and play will take us from image to agency. A more productive approach would be to focus on developing those skills (including through changes in the social order), but that option is constrained in part by the predominance of the very imagery of which Meyers is critical. She uses commanding language in her argument for experimentation with new subjectivities—women
      mustscreen,mustviscerally imagine,mustembed new self‐images,mustcommand skills. This makes it easy to miss her recognition of the insufficiency of such measures, as does the relative lack of detailed proposals for restructuring the social order. Yet one cannot simply flout the power of cultural images in women’s lives. By exposing the feedback loop between self‐image and agentic skills in a patriarchal order, Meyers establishes that image and agency are not two distinct paths. Her emphasis may be on imagery, but it is clear that image and large‐scale political change mu~<br>

Abstract: In the West, process philosophy is usually traced back to Heraclitas in antiquity, but this line has continued through Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Henri Bergson, and Alfred North Whitehead, who have all contributed ideas that are identifiable with this tradition [
         4]. Gare now argues that recognition of Friedrich Schelling (1755–1854) as a process philosopher will enable us to further this tradition and make sense of the possibilities that it opens before us [8]. Indeed, Gare addresses a criticism from Rescher [4] that process thought is yet to be a well‐developed theory centered on a broader contribution than that of Alfred North Whitehead. According to Schelling [9], a process is definable as productivity that consists in opposed activities limiting each other, and he also highlights the importance of levels of activity, an emphasis that we can see pursued today, for example, in hierarchy theory [10]. That is, a hierarchy of activity is given prominence rather than a static hierarchy consisting of things, as products already achieved. Following this line of thought, we can appreciate how processes influence each other to form those conditions in which new possibilities emerge. It is this emphasis on emergence, found in process thinking but neglected in other traditions of philosophy, that is a major attraction of this philosophy.<br>

Abstract: We are now in a position to understand the relationship between the cyborg and women of color. At one level there is no relationship, only oneness. Since in the informatics of domination we all cannot help being cyborgs, women of color are cyborgs. But the ultimate relationship is again analogical. Just as the cyborg is a fusion of human and machine, a monstrous and illegitimate fusion, so, the argument goes, is the constituency of women of color, forged as it is without identity. Thus is it not surprising that race sometimes figures in Haraway’s essay in a similar fashion as it does in Rubin’s: “race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts” (Haraway
         1991, 181); “the causes of various women‐headed households are a function of race, class, or sexuality” (167); and “some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high‐tech‐facilitated social relations can make socialist‐feminism more relevant to effective progressive politics” (165). Cyborg identities, mediated through the politics of women of color, help defuse—or to use Wilkerson’s terminology, deny the responsibility of working with—whiteness and white feminist social location. Haraway’s stated reasons for turning to women of color make this clear. Haraway writes: “For me—and for many who share a similar historical location in white, professional middle‐class, female, radical, North American, mid‐adult bodies—the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition—affinity, not identity” (1991, 155). I argued earlier that analogy functions like a colonial fetish enabling the white feminist theorist to displace racial difference onto a safer notion of similarity. We can now add the following: racial analogy within (white) fem~<br>

Abstract: See Homi K. Bhabha,
            Location of Culture(London and New York: Routledge, 1994). Following in Fanon’s footsteps, he provides a pertinent analysis of how the identity‐shaping recognitive process within the concrete historical conditions of colonialism and its postcolonial aftermath has worked to suppress the play of difference within each cultural identity. Part of the strategy of colonial rule and ideological justification for the European colonizers, he points out, was always to construct rules and standards of recognition around the notions of “modernity,” “rationality,” and “progress” and to produce a totalizing and hierarchically structured binary opposition between the colonizers and the colonized by recognizing the full presence of modernity and rationality in the former while assigning to the latter their complete absence or merely partial presence. The colonizing Europe accomplished this by disavowing the presence of heterogeneity within itself, such as the feminine and the irrational, and symbolically constructing and representing the colonized cultures as the essentialized Other of its now homogeneous rational self (and civilized, muscular Christianity)—e.g., the bestially sexual Africans, the duplicitous Chinese, and the effeminate and degenerate Hindus. But the artificial construction of such a binary opposition is inherently unstable, Bhabha argues, as can be seen for instance from the self‐contradictory nature of the colonizers’ attempt to convert the subject population to Christianity and to create a class of colonial elites educated in the ways of Europe, which was tantamount to an implicit recognition of the capacity of the colonized for rationality and self‐government, while at the same time deprecating and deriding that recognized presence of the “civilized” qualities in them as mere mimicry or even mockery of the authentic European, Christian identity. According to Bhabha, it is precisely the practice of mimicry on the part of the colon~<br>

Abstract: Frei’s discussion of Midrash contrasts with his criticism of Phillips’s position. He describes Midrash as a practice of reading that is primarily responsible to the community, but in such a way that it enables second‐order discourse to emerge. Indeed, the description above is very close to the type 4 of Barth’s theology. Midrash avoids “parroting” because of its recognition that there are gaps, or problems, within the biblical text—issues that arise within the practice of reading by the community.
         Derasharises from withinpeshat,which, as Loewe describes, always already has a latent dynamism. The priority of the literal sense emerges in how the problems raised by such gaps are resolved—namely, through intratextual reading that relates the words and phrasings of the texts to other scriptural passages. The juxtaposition and interplay of diverse, often “surprising” passages opens the world of understanding for Midrash, without appeal to a general logical framework that would be imported and imposed onto the text. This practice of reading then becomes authoritative for the community—in Frei’s words, “a kind of instruction that has continuity of form.” It is, then, an interpretive practice that is primarily directed toward the community’s self‐understanding—but that can, to some degree, be understood by outsiders, and may make use of alternative logics to help clarify a particular case.<br>

Abstract: “Citatology” nearly always ignores this question, implicitly treating references to an author as an index of recognition (of indebtedness or legitimacy). In point of fact this apparent function may nearly always be associated with such diverse functions as the manifestation of relations of allegiance or dependence, of strategies of affiliation, of annexation or of defence (this is the role, for example, of guarantee references, ostentatious references or alibi‐references).<br>

Abstract: However, rights language when it comes to children should also be balanced with languages of adult responsibility. This can be seen by considering such children’s rights in the UN Convention as “freedom of expression” (art. 13), “freedom of thought, conscience and religion” (art. 14), and “access to [mass media] information” (art. 17). Expression, conscience, religion, and mass media information are issues, for children more acutely than for adults, not just of freedom and access—norms grounded in human agency—but also of nurturance, dependency, and guidance. The special relation of children’s rights to adult responsibilities was more clearly recognized in earlier international agreements in 1924 and 1959 on which the 1989 convention is partly based. Here one finds significantly more central language of adult and societal “duty” toward children, “responsibilities” for “special safeguards and care,” and children’s needs for “special protection” and extra “love and understanding.”
         44The language of adult responsibility, while not absent from the 1989 convention, in earlier agreements provides a clearer recognition that children are not just little adult agents deserving the same rights as all but are also profoundly vulnerable, relational, conditioned, and in need of special care from others.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Deliberation poses some stringent requirements within the framework of ultimately reaching a just and fair outcome. This is, in fact, the case with ethical and moral theory in general. Jürgen Habermas points out, “Since moralities are tailored to suit the fragility of human beings individuated through socialization, they must always solve two tasks at once. They must emphasize the inviolability of the individual by postulating equal respect for the dignity of each individual. But they must also protect the web of intersubjective relations of mutual recognition by which these individuals survive as members of a community” [
         35, p. 200]. Habermas’s is a fundamentally phenomenological perspective insofar as the relationship between self and other is a foundational imperative. (You are different from me, and you and your ideas have legitimacy. You and I share the moral imperative; moreover, I must acknowledge and operate according to your right to be.) Building on the phenomenological base, he outlines a discourse ethics as a practical means of deliberating and accepting moral norms. There are advantages to discourse ethics within our professional community. For one thing, even in the initial stages of deliberation, the positions taken by all participants can be known; there is a starting point from which to begin. For another, discourse ethics requires that there be publicity, that positions and, more important, reasons for holding positions be made public so that they can be deliberated. There is a genuine process of argumentation at work in order for both the validity of an argument (the logical connection between conclusion and premises) and the truth of the premises and propositions to be tested in an open forum.<br>

Abstract: Omissions are plentiful in these accounts: the selection of a field, the routines of teaching, squabbles with colleagues, rivalries, ambition and desire for recognition. Exceptions surface here too—women who discuss gender bias in their profession, authors from the working class who struggle to adapt to the academic world—but most authors keep mute on the same questions. Popkin offers several explanations for these silences, ranging from shame to fear of colleagues’ reactions to narrative concerns (tedium, lack of drama). The most significant and fascinating factor, however, is that these authors write autobiographies as, first and foremost, members of a profession. They free themselves, it is true, from this profession’s norm of self‐effacement by expressing their individuality and discussing private matters. But they do not shed their disciplinary identity in the process. On the contrary, their autobiographies sustain the profession’s norms and values. They minimize conflicts, belittle individual achievements (in the classroom, for instance), and omit mention of aspirations that question the ideal of fraternal, disinterested scholars who live a pure life of the mind. This is true of other disciplines as well, but history, reliant as it is on cumulative, collective scholarship, finds it especially difficult to celebrate individual achievement. Autobiography, this most personal of genres, hence services collective authority, professional community, and an ostensible containment of the self.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Derrida upholds both injunctions of the tradition in question rather than solely privileging the structurally necessary element of secrecy, which Patočka associates with heretical Christianity, to the detriment of the cognitive element in responsibility advanced by Platonism. Yet his innovative interpretation of the heritage of responsibility consists neither in attempting to mediate between both demands nor in establishing their golden mean. Instead, what distinguishes Derrida’s interpretation of the Platonic and the Christian heritages is, first of all, the recognition that “the relation between the Platonic and Christian paradigms throughout the history of morality and politics” is defined by the “
      aporia of responsibility” (GD,p. 24). Responsibility toward this inheritance is itself aporetic; it excludes the choice of one of the inherited conceptions of responsibility at the expense of the other; that is, it requires that both traditions be simultaneously honored without any mitigation of the radicalness of their demands. The injunctions—on the one hand, of full knowledge of one’s actions, on the other, of secrecy—are mutually exclusive; moreover, we are unable to account for either of them. Thus, no program exists that could prescribe a way out of this dilemma.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: The current return to a historical present teeming with competing temporalities from the past recalls both repetitions from other times and places and what perceiving them meant for social theory. Specifically, this recognition refers to those attempts envisaged by people like Tosaka and Maurice Halbwachs before World War II who sought to account for the spectacle of mixed temporalities in the present. Both, it is important to acknowledge, discounted the veracity of history’s claims to a true time and proposed conceptions of temporality they believed to be emanating from the historical process itself (as they conceived it). The consequence of Halbwachs’s and Tosaka’s interventions was to deprivilege state archives and thus shifted the order of the Hegelian allegory symbolizing the conflict between Chronos, the god of Time, and Zeus, the god of politics who created state and hearth. In this struggle, Chronos, who inevitably devours his own, engulfing all in his passage, is ultimately dominated by Zeus, who creates the state, which in turn conquers time. Just as important is the state’s capacity to transform in history all that Mnemosyne—the goddess of memory—had been able to collect after the rampaging passage of time.
         25It is also worth mentioning that while Halbwachs codified the separation of history from memory and upheld the claims of the latter over the former (that is to say, the claims of time over space) the effort to rematerialize time—yet retain its qualitative character—by freeing it from an interiorized, psychological consciousness was not attempted in Europe or America, but Japan. Tosaka’s critique of what he called “borrowed time,”26referring to history’s reliance on conceptions of time from other disciplines—the physical sciences, but especially the inner time consciousness of phenomenology and even mythology—and his identification of the everyday (especially as lived by the worker) revealed the real source of historical time, the “mystery of~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: In Smith’s usage, “translate” is best understood as a metaphor whose “clash between semantic fields” creates a third valence—“a pertinence within impertinence”—that illuminates Smith’s method by contrasting the ways in which it was both like and not like translating.
         38His reading and writing of sacred text was like translating insofar as Smith was “study[ing] it out in [his] mind” in response to a source document. It is not like translating insofar as Smith made large additions to his sources and claimed for them the historicity of the original. In the contrast, another meaning arises that depends upon the recognition of the metaphor’s incongruity, namely, Smith’s claim of power as a prophet to rewrite the prophets. In other words, as with all metaphors, Smith’s “translate” requires that one “continue to perceive the previous incompatibility through the new compatibility” of what Smith was signifying about both himself as prophet and his texts as scripture. For his believing readers, these contraries combine to express Smith’s prophetic authority to divine the truth about God’s past acts within the narrative limits of ancient, prophetic history. For the academic reader, these contraries suggest an imagination both governed by text and productive of it, reconfiguring the past to suggest what could be, to even create the possible and the real.<br>

Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against the first characterization of Advaita teaching, the recognition of the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the
         anayatvamsutra (II.1.14)—that is, as internally constituted by the realist cosmological discourse that it subverts—suggests that the interpretation of theBhāṣya’steaching in terms of the illusionist doctrine ofmāyāvādais reductionistic. Moreover, well‐intentioned attempts to dissociate Śaṅkara frommāyāvādathat presume a monological conception of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse, attempts such as that of Srinivasa Rao mentioned above, end up effectively conceding the claim they set out to deny; their affirmation of the reality of the world typically appeals to a denial of substantial change, a claim that implicitly relegates changing, finite existences to the realm of the unreal.114As for the static and abstract conception of brahman, this notion can be seen as the result of the later tradition’s attempt to impose a rigid, categorical distinction between the concepts ofīśvaraand the highest (paraṃ) brahman. This effort to systematize Śaṅkara’s somewhat inconsistent, fluid, and intuitive use of the termīśvarawith respect to the various expressions for brahman effectively pulls apart the dialectical interplay between the personalistic and impersonalistic aspects of brahman in theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣya. What Hacker characterizes as an “illogical” combination of intuitive theism and intellectual monism can perhaps be better understood as an instance of what Michael Sells, in a discussion of apophatic language in the West, calls “a discourse of double propositions.”115A reading of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyathat appreciates the creative interplay among this text’s multiple voices preserves the vitality and intensity of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse on brahman, a liveliness of expression that we may assume more accurately reflects Śaṅkara’s religious vision.<br>

Abstract: Rewritings of texts that are still under copyright illuminate this process. First published in Italian in 1995 and subsequently issued in a Dutch translation in 1996, Pera’s rewriting of
         Lolitafrom the eponymous character’s perspective was blocked from publication in the United States by Vladimir Nabokov’s son, Dmitri, who claimed copyright infringement. The case was settled with Dmitri Nabokov writing a preface to the novel and half of Pera’s royalties going to PEN (Poets, Playwrights, Essayists, and Novelists).13According to Nabokov, Pera is trading on the celebrity ofLolita, “seek[ing] inspiration, fortune and fame” from his father’s world‐famous novel. Taking Pera’s lawyer up on his argument thatLo’s Diaryis a “transformative” work, Nabokov observes: “My Fair Lady,West Side Story, Stoppard’sRosencrantz and Guildenstern, Updike’sS, Jean Rhys’sWide Sargasso Sea… all had been safely tucked into the public domain when the ‘transformations’ were penned.Lolitaisn’t in the public domain, and won’t be until well into the next millennium when its copyright expires” (Nabokov1999, viii). The distinction, no doubt, is important; texts under copyright require dues to be paid, and their authors or estates can file suit to see their rights honored. Yet in their attempts to keep unauthorized rewritings at bay, they reveal a mechanism that is inherent to all rewriting, the effects of which are of the order of brand recognition.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Another problem is the book’s unrelenting abstractness. As noted above, issues of nonviolence, solidarity, and dialogue seem to be hovering in the background, but never once does Reynolds mention any actual situation where real communities have confronted these issues. His argument stringently avoids any reference to concrete historical examples. Reynolds also exhibits the dismaying tendency of using simple declarative sentences like these: “The other is a presence who solicits my response by signaling a promise precisely in its distance. Its call is not anonymous, but signifies the trace of something that invites recognition and bids me to pay attention to it. I respond. My world is adjusted. I am transposed, tilted toward the exterior” (113). Where, when, and how are these things actually happening? Only in a vague, theoretical stratosphere? Or in real life? If the latter, why not dwell on a few specific examples? Jargon and underdefined catchphrases further obscure matters: “Thus, meaningful vitality is the constitutive affirmation of being‐with, an affirmation that reflects a presentiment of surplus value intrinsic to the we‐relation” (123).<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: To call the subsequent lexical effacement of the feminized hero in the final paragraph a displacement and condensation respectively—of maternal absence
         uponand thenwithinthe very identification of the marriageable male—is to begin suggesting, with the unconscious of Dickensian grammar caught out in this way, where attention itself might be caught up by such a disjuncture. Forunconsciousis just the word. One can only follow out the prose's diffusive lines of stress in and through the transferential recognitions of that analytic session called reading. By the invested give- and-take of such legibility, in this and many another fictional case, the psycholinguistic trace of elided desire is offered up to registration. It comes to us, as we bring our recognition to it, along the serial slippage between plot and its inscriptive medium, between the manifest propulsion of event and a subterranean impetus glimpsed on the run in the kinks of wording. Concerning the unrevealed mother, we can never be sure what Dickens meant to finesse or massage or avoid or foreclose or, alternately, what he himself as author may have entirely repressed in the psychodynamic of his narrative plotting inLittle Dorritfrom chapter plan to finished book. All we know is that hiswritingappears to be no more than half conscious of these operations—no more, but no less. It is this reciprocal remainder under the transferential analysis I am here calling narratography that keeps the legible textin playacross the more imperious s/pacings of plot.<br>

Abstract: Bergson,
            L’énergie spirituèlle, 137, 183. Although Bergson does not provide a scientific explication of this motion of reciprocal “harmonization” between past memory and present situation, his description suggests the phenomenon analogous to what contemporary immunology and neuroscience call “binding”: the “harmonization” of past and present is permitted, that is, by a matching or recognition whereby a preexistent memory turns out to fit a present sense perception better than all other competing memories. For a definition of “binding,” see Massimo Piattelli‐Palmarini, “Evolution, Selection, and Cognition: From ‘Learning’ to Parameter Setting in Biology and in the Study of Language,”Cognition31 (1989): 1–44, esp. 15–17.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: Such diversity inevitably generates interpretive contradictions and makes the author's stated goals—to compare the films' thematic content and form with those of the colonial cinema that preceded it and to use postcolonial film as a barometer for assessing how French collective memory has come to terms with its imperialist history—difficult to achieve. While Eades's painstaking analysis of the continuities and ruptures between colonial and postcolonial cinema is impressive, her contention that the latter “forced recognition of a reality grudgingly accepted by political authorities and the general population” (22) until the mid‐1990s and “called into question imperial ideology in all its dimensions” (203) is less convincing. While the majority of these films do at some level acknowledge the failures and abuses of French imperialism, most also avoid explicit reference to controversial issues and events (most notably, the French army's practice of torture in Algeria) and ignore the subjective experience of colonized peoples, highlighting instead the plight of colonizers caught in morally untenable situations because of the corrupt system that surrounds them. The result, as Eades recognizes, is that the colonized tend to remain little more than stereotypes while audiences are encouraged to identify with the European perspective. In so doing, postcolonial cinema implicitly perpetuates the epistemological prejudices of overtly imperialist films from the 1920s and 1930s.<br>

Abstract: Like many organisms, once a critical size had been reached, film studies effectively split into separate interest groups. In the midst of the videotape revolution,
         mediacame to serve as the common term to buffer cultural studies and film studies. For media studies inevitably belongs to the former while it includes the latter as one of its manifestations. If any discipline in the humanities can claim to be emergent it would surely be media studies. Always taken as an institution rather than a method, media studies encompasses—besides film, the first technological medium to win recognition in the academy—television, radio, and sometimes journalism, even public relations. Most importantly, it features new media at its cutting edge. Media studies effectively amounts to communications reborn in the postmodern era. A growing bibliography of media theory may satisfy skeptics about its seriousness, yet media studies has a difficult time, more difficult than film studies, proving itself to be methodical in any sustained manner.<br>

Abstract: Similar illustrations of immanent dispossession abounded during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While Fénelon's censure in 1699 appeared to neutralize the threat posed by mysticism, Christian apologists turned from this victory to confront attacks on human agency stemming from Spinozist and materialist circles. A key battle in this polemic was fought over the status of free will as a property of the thinking subject, whether human or divine. Spinoza aimed to demonstrate that God acts
         asnature, notonnature, and out of sheer necessity. Created beings operated under a similar compulsion. The distinction between subject and object, famously associated with Descartes, was thereby dissolved. To cite theEthics(1677): “When we say that the human mind perceives this or that thing, we say nothing else than that God possesses this or that idea.”46In other words, the subject's thoughts are not its own, unique to itself, but are the manifestation of God thinking in the world and through the mind. It followed from this premise that “there is no absolute or free will,” a conclusion that undermined the possibility of transcendence for any being.47Spinoza therefore understood the highest form of wisdom, which he called the “intellectual love of God,” to be the recognition of the determined character of our existence. We are, he asserted, “part of the whole of nature, whose order we follow.”48In consequence, true liberty “is to be and to remain chained by the bonds of [God's] love.”49And this love, Spinoza claimed, was not directed toward the individual human person. It was, on the contrary, “part of the infinite love with which God loves Himself.”50For Spinoza, then, intellectual love is radically self-referential—not to the human subject, but to divine substance. The beatified self exists merely as an effect of God/Nature's immanent presence and totalizing force. At the same time, Spinoza extended dispossession beyond what Fénelon's Christian beliefs would permit~<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: In sum, implicit in this oath to the death are all the features described above under “Ritual Performances and Liturgical Orders.” The oath relies for compulsion on oath‐making paradigms from the times of the nascent Islamic community and imposes a hallowed duty to respect oaths onto the ritual actors. The composer of these instructions would have known that oath making is strongly conventionalized in the Islamic tradition and would have relied on the convention’s persuasive sanctity to coax the ritual actor to see himself as bound to the oath. Within the scheme of liturgical orders, the oath’s purifying rites (shaving, showering, etc.) might be seen as ritualized microadjustments that help to seal a sacred commitment. Such microadjustments also propel ritual communication to a very high register, which is one measure of its irrevocability. As noted above, just swearing an oath is a metaperformative ritual that compels recognition of the convention it enacts, exactly while it instantiates it. It thus is final, regardless of any internal infelicities on the part of the oath swearer. The feared infelicities that this oath needed to overcome were, doubtlessly, a victory of self‐love over the intention to die and, more important, moral uncertainty in the face of well‐known Islamic prohibitions on suicide.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur importantly contends that the logic of equivalence and the logic of superabundance, the reciprocated and the pure gift, are not ultimately opposed. He articulates this in “Love and Justice” and

Contrast this with John Milbank who, while he rightly wishes to purify the agonism of Mauss’s gift without abandoning exchange or reciprocity, objects to any moment of gift exchange that has a unilateral moment.

Abstract: Animals (in this essay referring to all self-moving species, including insects, birds, and fish as well as mammals), as a dominant source for metaphor, simile, allegory, and symbol, abound in literature of all eras. In the Middle Ages, as Jacques Le Goff wrote some forty-odd years ago in
         Medieval Civilization, animals were the subject of constant attention and reflection.10A recent spate of books, all published since 1999, includesMicrologus, Jacques Voisenet'sBêtes et hommes dans le monde médiéval(Beasts and man in the medieval world),L'animal exemplaire au Moyen Âge(The exemplary animal in the Middle Ages), Francesco Zambon'sL'alfabeto simbolico degli animali(Symbolic alphabet of animals), David Salter'sHoly and Noble Beasts, andAristotle's Animals in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.11What has emerged is a recognition of the complexity and diversity of the treatment and role of animals in the medieval imagination.12Rather than simple allegory or moral exempla, particularly after Michael Scot's thirteenth-century translation of Aristotle'sDe animalibus(On animals),13animal representation could include, often in a single case, empirical knowledge, theology, philosophy, politics, and cosmology as well as poetic or artistic ornamentation.<br>

Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: And just as the play solicits sympathy with Faustus in its spectacle and its comedy, so does it invite pity for Faustus in its tragedy. Such pity emerges from a slightly different kind of theatrical identification, however. Rather than accompanying the spectator's recognition that a character shares his or her interests, pity may arise when the spectator recognizes the character's otherness, when he apprehends or infers that the character suffers inwardly in an extraordinary way. Yet in pity the spectator also identifies in some sense with the tragic character, for he feels psychic pain in his imagination of the character's suffering. For Levinas, for instance, pity, as an expression of the subject's irreducibly asymmetrical obligation to the other, is fundamental to ethics.
      34But inDoctor Faustus, pity has no salutary ethical or moral value; on the contrary, the play explicitly contrasts the quality of human pity to that of divine mercy, thereby fashioning pity for Faustus as an aesthetic response that undermines the spectator's faith in God. It is the old man who thus devalues tragic pity. After Helen leaves the stage for the first time, the old man tells Faustus that an “angel” hovers over his head “with a vial full of precious grace” to “pour” into his “soul” (5.1.54–56), and he urges Faustus to repent—to “break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears” (5.1.40)—warning him that he has endangered his inward soul “with such flagitious crimes of heinous sins / As no commiseration may expel / But mercy, Faustus, of thy Savior sweet, / Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt” (5.1.43–46). “Commiseration” is, of course, the contemporaneous word for the pity inspired by tragedy; Sidney uses it as such inThe Defense of Poesy.35The old man argues, then, that Faustus is no less damnable for being pitiful, yet his argument, orthodox as it may be, not only makes God seem somehow less compassionate than even the crudest member of the audience moved by Faustus's ~<br>

Abstract: Larmore critiques several familiar conceptions of authenticity. He argues that the effort to “become one” with one’s “intimate core” is self-defeating because recognition of this state would undo it (8). He also argues that the romantic idea of discovering a “true self” that “one is already” at heart without influence from others (9) is impossible—not only because such a union with “our inner core” could only be a by-product of other pursuits (17) but also because even our most original inspirations “take shape within a community” (34); we are essentially mimetic beings all the way down (34). Since I cannot do justice to these fascinating arguments here, I will simply register four quick reservations.<br>

Abstract: David Parkin identifies and endorses two points critical to my argument, namely, the methodological principle that “the boundaries of the positive are predicated on the definitional challenges of the negative,” and the recognition that “evil is existentially present even if not amenable to set identification.” He refers to my observation that he purposefully excluded witchcraft from themes treated in
         The Anthropology of Eviland accepts my rationale for examining it here. It just may be that when his volume appeared nearly 30 years ago witchcraft was too obvious a place to look for evil, whereas to me it appeared a useful topic to revisit, given current intellectual considerations concerning morality. Interestingly, once Parkin accepts witchcraft as exemplary of human evil, as a move to demystify and de-theologize the category, he himself takes the next step of reintroducing evil conceived supernaturally and how it displaces culpability. The questions of whether evil attacks humans or lies among humans, and of whether evil is other than human or an extension of the human, call into question the boundaries of humanity. Independently of whether morality is divinely ordained or whether religion and morality are conceived as coterminous, the space between human and nonhuman is one of both moral and religious ambiguity. Witches may be something less than human, spirits may be in some respects like people and in others like animals, djinn may be like people except made of fire and air while we are made of earth and water, and angels or devils inhabit a preternatural world somewhere between the natural and supernatural.<br>

Date: February 2005<br>
Author(s): Higgins Paula<br>
Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of Roland Barthes's writings on myth and ideology, this essay seeks to expose the historical legitimation project through which the mythmaking, universalizing rhetoric of musical genius that has long surrounded the figure of Ludwig van Beethoven came to infiltrate scholarship on Josquin des Prez, culminating in his late twentieth-century apotheosis. Contextualizing the composer's reception history with respect to the debates between Joseph Kerman and Edward Lowinsky in 1965 and especially the 1971 Josquin Festival-Conference, the author suggests that the ideological refashioning of Josquin in the image of Beethoven has simultaneously shaped and derailed the intellectual trajectory of early music scholarship in the past thirty years. By privileging a discourse of musical genius in the service of which, among other concerns, the canon of works attributed to the composer is being decimated beyond historical recognition, the richness and complexity of the musical culture of which he was a vital part risks being overshadowed and obfuscated by the disproportionate amount of attention invested in his singular accomplishments. The essay advocates a resolute historicization of sixteenth-century discourses of creative endowment, a critical reassessment of the role of authentication scholarship in Josquin studies, and a renewed sensitivity to the imbrication of mythologies of musical genius in music historiographies of both the past and the present.<br>

Abstract: The project of the Palace of Fine Arts has been reduced by some to a "folly," an odd Beaux-Arts foray by a recognized master of Arts and Crafts architecture.
         
               Others dismissed the structure as a crude mockup that violated the rules of classical architecture.119
            
               In fact, it displayed the best of both sources of Maybeck's inspiration—Beaux-Arts and Arts and Crafts—combined as a poetic reflection on the fleeting nature of human creation. Perhaps Reyner Banham's recognition of these qualities lead him to conclude, "I went to see it more or less on a 'duty' list of San Francisco monuments and was staggered by an impact, comparable to that of the Basilica of Maxentius."120<br>

Abstract: This essay addresses the problematical nature of the meaning of religion as it is related to the formation and destiny of peoples of African descent in the United States. Moving beyond a narrow understanding of the nature of religion as expressed in much of Black Theology, for example, this essay proposes a "thick" and complex depiction of religion in the African American context through a recognition of its relationship to the contact and conquest that marked the modern world.<br>

The views of these authors are clarified and the contradictory relationship between the limited individual subject and the recognition of the true Self is shown. With the help of Utpaladeva's distinction between "seeing" and "noticing," a further interpretation is attempted. Some remarks are made concerning practical meditation and the theoretical presuppositions of this way of thinking in order to find starting points for a comparison with Western philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Whitehead Charles E.<br>
Abstract: The focus of contemporary studies in religion on methodology can be explored as the recognition of a fundamental epistemological problem. This paper is first an acknowledgment that we do not have an adequate conceptuality to render intelligible inward turning and then an experiment with the meaning of intelligibility. The dispossession of consciousness as the sole place and origin of meaning constituting an intellectual aporia is presented as an experience of the subversion of the subject by the discovery of the unconscious in depth psychologies and the discovery of the transcendence of the subject in foundational theologies. Taking account of this duplex expression of what lingers in disguise behind the scripts of ordinary life is defined as a fundamental exigency in the further development of human understanding and theological reflection.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>
Date: 12 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Winter Charles R.<br>
Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Author(s): Vinyard Dana<br>
Abstract: This paper provides a phenomenological account of the writing of a young woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method of interpretation is to put ourselves in the place of the author drawing upon a combination of sympathy, reason, common-sense, experience, and "an intersubjective world, common to us all" (Schutz, 1945: 536). The result is the recognition of the person as also capable of putting herself in the place of others so as to understand their behavior. This "role-taking success" identifies the limits of the current sociological understanding of insanity's significance in social interaction as an instance of "role-taking failure" (Rosenberg, 1992).<br>

Abstract: When analysing the concept of social relationship, the link between a person and an individual, who from a sociological perspective do not have the same semantic value, needs to be reconsidered as whole. As an individual is typically enclosed in a social dimension, it cannot have a self-referential character. Instead, it tends to half-reveal the authentic foundation of the civil society on the basis of a range of values which, after leading to the recognition of the self, activate relationships with the social other and the rest of the world including the transcendental one. In fact, within the opening relationship it's possible to find the conscience of own existence, to purchase the awareness of own identities and to become responsible of own world of life. Considering the aspects of sociological compromise and moral quality of the afore-going, it is clear that socio-cultural exchanges — where relationship skills come clearly into play — are the heuristic foundation of the complex relationship between individuals and society. Consequently, such exchanges become social dynamics through which affective similarities and legitimate differences interact to build an ethical balance for society as well as support a differentiated development of social bonds.<br>

Abstract: Tannaitic rabbis permit wedding processions but prohibit practices associated with these festivities, including the wearing of bridal crowns. Studies of rabbinic ritual based on social scientific models have overlooked the historical disjunction between Tannaitic and Amoraic evidence for weddings. This study explores this puzzling combination of prohibitions and permissions by making use of Catherine Bell's discussion of ritualization. Attention to practice as outlined by Bell leads to a renewed focus on the textual framing of Tannaitic discourse concerning wedding processions. This focus in turn leads to the recognition that the early rabbis create their own vision of wedding practice through negotiating their own historic moment—end-times. The larger eschatological context explored at the end of Sotah with its talk of extreme ascetic responses to end-times provides a framework for understanding Sotah's limited prohibitions concerning wedding processions and reveals a compromise reached by the various agents that remains otherwise obscured.<br>

Abstract: How does a generation without personal memory begin to grapple with its urban past in a nation that has silenced its memories? Moreover, how are symbolic sites of memory recovered and represented by such a generation? Much recent scholarship on post-war Lebanon has studied the memory culture of the decades following the declared end of civil war in 1990. This scholarship deals with the implications of Lebanon's 'amnesiac' political culture on the social and political landscape. In the meantime, Lebanon—and especially Beirut's—urban landscape has been altered beyond recognition by post-war reconstruction, mostly by private real estate holding companies, the most notorious of which is Solidere. In the early 2000s, as Solidere's activity picked up speed, a slew of historical novels about Lebanon and especially Beirut was published in both Arabic and French. In this article, I will focus exclusively on the strategies of urban commemoration in Rabīʿ Jābir's trilogy. I argue that the genre of historical fiction is used in these novels to re-create the downtown life of Beirut in and around Martyrs' Square from the 19th and early 20th century, a commemoration of a cityscape and an urban lifestyle that its author recreates using the tools of the archive (documents, bibliographies, etc.). This post-memorial fiction—here, I use Marianne Hirsch's definition of postmemory as "second-generation memories of cultural and collective traumas and experience" (22)—attempts to recover Beirut's repressed Ottoman urban history, and to re-write Solidere's narrative of the city center. By intertwining downtown Beirut's past with its present, in a clever back-and-forth palimpsestic act that superimposes the historical city upon the present city—site of capitalist consumption—Jābir's novels map out the old upon the new, and thus refuses the erasure of the ancient city by its newest urbanists. In Jābir's novels, a new, contestatory commemorative narrative of Beirut's history and—more significa~<br>

Abstract: This study builds on the premise that local knowledge of limestone—and its workable characteristics—was foundational to landscape inhabitation in the Puuc region of Yucatán, México. Classic Maya architecture of the northern Yucatán generally is considered to represent the apogee of Maya construction prowess with extensive use of core-veneer masonry and the creation of tall, wide corbelled vaults. Less commonly discussed is the variable distribution of high-quality limestone across the Yucatán, the social matrix that undergirds the quarrying, transporting, and working of limestone, and the pronounced social differences materialized in stone architecture. This study explores these three topics by bringing to bear Yucatec Mayan linguistic evidence and excavation data from the archaeological site of Sayil, in the hilly Puuc region of Yucatán. That information provides a basis for understanding the development of a sprawling residential complex, the role that variable limestone quality played in its expansion, and serves as an index of intra-compound social difference. Late additions to the dwellings indicate that recognition of the cultural value of carved stone persisted long after masonry skills became attenuated. The durability of stone renders it a particularly effective—if underutilized—medium for interpreting social landscapes of the past. Este estudio amplifica la premisa de que el conocimiento de la piedra caliza—y sus propiedades arteseanales—fue una base fundamental para la ocupación del paisaje de la Región Puuc, Yucatán, México. En general, la arquitectura de los mayas de la época Clásica del norte de Yucatán se considera representativa del apogeo de su proeza arquitectónica con el uso extensivo de núcleos de piedra burda recubiertos de piedra labrada y la creación de habitaciones con bóvedas altas y anchas. Menos mencionados son la distribución geográfica variable de piedra caliza de alta calidad a través de Yucatán, la matriz social que permite la explotac~<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: CONTEMPORARY HUMANITARIAN CRISES UNDERSCORE WHAT HANNAH Arendt called the "perplexities" of human rights; the very category "refugee" attests the failure of the global rights regime. Indeed, the "abstract nakedness of being nothing but human" belies the "right to have rights." In light of this criticism, I offer a reconstructive, communitarian interpretation of the rights of the forcibly displaced. The grammar of rights, I argue, presumes the communicative virtues of respect and recognition of the "concrete other." I conclude by showing how biblical narrative "re-inscribes" stateless persons/strangers precisely as neighbor (Lev. 19:18, 33—34) in "anamnestic solidarity."<br>

Abstract: L'article aborde la question de l'universalisation que l'on attend du processus actuel de mondialisation, qui unifie la planète sur la base de l'économie du marché. Sous la poussée de la rationalité scientifique, la mondialisation réalise une universalisation de moyens susceptibles d'ouvrir potentiellement à toute l'humanité l'accès à des biens élémentaires qui améliorent son bien-être en libérant du besoin. On remarque toutefois que, sous l'influence de l'idéologie néolibérale, la prédominance de la dimension économique invertit la mondialisation en un projet instrumental de la part de ceux qui considèrent toute réalité, y compris l'homme, comme un moyen. La mondialisation produit ainsi une universalisation rationnelle qui concerne les choses ou les moyens, et non les hommes. Loin donc de réaliser la véritable universalisation de l'humanité, elle en pose tout au plus les conditions matérielles d'avènement et laisse de côté le problème crucial de la reconnaissance de l'homme par l'homme. The article addresses the question of the universalisation that can be expected from the current process of globalisation, which unifies the planet on the basis of the market economy. Propelled by scientific rationality, globalisation is producing a universalisation of resources that has the potential of providing all of humanity access to those basic goods which increase wellbeing by eliminating need. Nonetheless, it is observed that, under the influence of neoliberal ideology, the predominance of the economic dimension transforms globalisation into a project used by those who consider all reality, including human beings, as a means. Globalisation thus produces a rational universalisation that impacts things and resources but not human beings. Far from bringing about a true universalisation of humanity, globalisation at the most sets the material conditions of access but leaves to the side the crucial problem of the mutual recognition of man for man.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur connects the philosophical concept of 'recognition' to the ethnological analysis of ceremonial gift exchange by focusing on the term 'gratitude'. Particularly by means of a content analysis of the French word 'reconnaissance' (recognition) Ricoeur demonstrates that the term 'reconnaissance' is closely linked with the notion of gratitude. Thus Ricoeur broadens the philosophical concept of 'recognition', that is mainly defined in reference to the influential idea of an endless 'struggle for recognition' (Kampf um Anerkennung) as Friedrich Hegel puts it. Ricoeur outlines the interesting idea that gratitude binds donor and recipient together and that the ceremonial gift exchange symbolises the mutual recognition of donor and recipient. Hence the experience of the gift should be understood as the experience of being recognised. I wish to pursue these considerations by arguing that the gift exchange can only then be considered as establishing a mutual recognition if the gift itself is also recognised and acknowledged as such. As Marcel Mauss demonstrated this is the case in traditional societies. As soon, however, as the gift loses this special capacity to express recognition, the mutual recognition of donor and recipient will be lost.<br>

Abstract: Tolerance is a concept fundamental to the order of a pluralistic society. The concept, however, contains within it various dimensions and is therefore subject to misunderstanding (I). This article will first examine the ways in which tolerance as a social behavioural virtue differs from the duty of neutrality required of the public authorities (II). Furthermore, it will discuss whether and to what extend the public authorities are authorised to educate society in tolerance (III). Finally, a distinction will be drawn between the expectation of tolerance and the more far-reaching principle of recognition (IV).<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>

Author(s): PATRICK MORAG<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary liberals increasingly accept that plural societies must aspire to far more expansive and inclusive ideals of justice and citizenship than liberal doctrine would suggest. The dominant perception is that extending the set of rights is the most effective way to implement a just and stable multicultural society. In fact, this is not a very plausible description of what people seek in demanding greater respect for diversity. Nor does it offer a compelling vision of how things ought to be. First, social expectations regarding recognition are not uniquely linked to rights; they encompass intractable struggles over values, as well as ways of living and evaluating. For example, a central feature of feminist, black and multicultural politics is the attempt to change social culture into a medium through which personal integrity and self-esteem may be acquired. Second, liberalism cannot easily accommodate this type of struggle, since it takes for granted a narrowly constricted conception of politics that is based on instituting public laws that harmonize the freedom of everyone. Anyone who takes seriously the idea that recognition surpasses legal relations of respect will then surely wish to consider whether liberalism must not be corrected and extended to reveal the political significance of the social conditions that enable individuals to experience themselves as both autonomous and individuated.<br>

Article Title: Bourdieu and Derrida on Gift: Beyond "Double Truth" and Paradox<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i24021505<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Ungureanu Camil<br>
Abstract: Bourdieu and Derrida share a focus on the ambiguity of the practice of gift relationships already pointed out by Mauss. From Bourdieu's perspective, the question of gratuity is epistemically futile, as it veils the objective truth of gift-giving, yet ethically and politically relevant, as it refers to a hypocrisy which can be instrumental to enhancing civic virtue and solidarity. Bourdieu's "scientific humanism," however, implausibly reduces this ambiguity to interest maximization, and aims to build a solidaristic democracy by means of the generalization of the hypocrisy of gratuity. In turn, by interpreting gratuity as "unconditionality," Derrida aims not at dissolving, but at dramatizing the ambiguity of gift relationships by turning it into "madness" and an "impossible possibility". Whereas I agree with Derrida's insistence on the salience of the requirement of gratuity, his approach can lead to counterintuitive and hubristic consequences. Instead, I suggest some elements of an alternative way of understanding gratuitous gifts as communicative acts irreducible to an economic calculation or circle. From this standpoint, a gratuitous gift can be constituted by certain forms of recognition, emotions, or convictions without for that becoming an "impossibility".<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to examine the development of the notion of "The Other" and to trace the implications of its effect on the dialoguic Philosophy. In "I and Thou" this category was not developed, at best it was suggested only vaguely, for in this text Buber does not carry out any ontological explication of this category. But such an explication was necessary and was later formulated gradualy by Buber. The clearer the ontological explication, the sharper the category of "the Other" is delineated. It is this category which establishes the I-Thou relationship. This development is expressed in Buber's writings with great tension, and we analyze it in detail, for the category of "the Other" and the central position which it occupies undermine the significance of the I-Thou relationship as it is presented in the book "I and Thou". Together with an acceptance of the primacy of "the Other" in this relationship, we must also assert the primacy of the "I" as the subject of reflective action, of the recognition of the other in his otherness. In this situation it is not the relationship which comes first but the detachment and the aloneness which exist between the I and Thou. We now have to rewise the notion of the dialogue from that purety of an event without content to that of an action of mutual assertion between I and the Other, where each one asserts the other in his otherness, where at the same time each is conscious of being asserted by the Other.<br>

Publisher: McGill<br>
Issue: i24352116<br>

Author(s): Gaillard Emilie<br>
Abstract: Faire appel à la notion de crimes contre les générations futures est assurément la marque de la progression d'une nouvelle conscience de responsabilité envers l'avenir, la condition humaine future, les autres espèces vivantes et l'environnement. Elle contribue à un changement de paradigme temporel déjà en marche aussi spécifique que nécessaire à notre temps. Reflet d'un nouvel imaginaire international, le projet de formalisation de crimes contre les générations futures recèle des potentialités de transformations inédites et puissantes sur le champ juridique. En prenant appui sur les théories éthiques de la responsabilité transgénérationnelle, il est permis de fournir un éclairage spécifique de la notion de crimes contre les générations futures. Des affinements théoriques peuvent s'avérer nécessaires en considération du contexte de connaissances. C'est une véritable conversion intellectuelle qui se profile avec l'admission d'un principe de non-discrimination temporelle en vertu duquel l'absence d'existence temporelle ne serait plus synonyme d'absence de droits ni de garantie juridique. Une complexification des logiques juridiques pour la mise en œuvre des crimes contre les générations futures est alors imaginable. Formuler des crimes contre les générations futures est également maïeutique en ce qu'ils appellent dans leur sillage la consécration d'un principe de dignité des générations futures. Un tel principe insufflerait une dynamique de recomposition du droit des droits de l'homme en l'ouvrant à la perspective transgénérationnelle. Des perspectives prospectives pour la notion de crimes contre les générations futures sont ouvertes avec l'idée d'intégrer également la protection de la condition humaine future. Quelques mises en garde prospectives sont formulées. Evoking the notion of crimes against future generations is certainly an indication of the development of a new awareness regarding accountability for the future of human, other living species and the environme~<br>

Article Title: Autonomy and the Subjective Character of Experience<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i24354104<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): ATKINS KIM<br>
Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Author(s): Bonnemann Jens<br>
Abstract: In ethics, when discussing problems of justice and a just social existence one question arises obviously: What is the normal case of the relation between I and you we start from? In moral philosophy, each position includes basic socio–anthropological convictions in that we understand the other, for example, primarily as competitor in the fight for essential resources or as a partner in communication. Thus, it is not the human being as isolated individual, or as specimen of the human species or socialised member of a historical society what needs to be understood. Instead, the individual in its relation to the other or others has been studied in phenomenology and the philosophy of dialogue of the twentieth century. In the following essay I focus on Martin Buber's and Jean–Paul Sartre's theories of intersubjectivity which I use in order to explore the meaning of recognition and disrespect for an individual. They offer a valuable contribution to questions of practical philosophy and the socio–philosophical diagnosis of our time.<br>

Abstract: In this article I analyze verbally portrayed experiences of 27 survivors from the 1990s' war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One aim of the article is to analyze markers for reconciliation and implacability, the second is to describe the terms for reconciliation which are actualized in those stories. The interactive dynamics, which occurred during the war, make the post-war reconciliation wartime associated. Narratives about reconciliation, implacability and terms for reconciliation, are not only formed in relation to the war as a whole but also in relation to one's own and others' wartime actions. The narratives about reconciliation become an arena in which we and them are played against each other in different ways – not least by rejecting the others' acts during the war. In the interviewees stories implacability is predominant but reconciliation is presented as a possibility if certain conditions are met. These conditions are, for instance, justice for war victims, perpetrators' recognition of crime and perpetrators' emotional commitment (for example the display of remorse and shame).<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i24439785<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): COLAPIETRO VINCENT<br>
Abstract: One criticism of pragmatism, forcefully articulated by Stanley Cavell, is that pragmatism fails to deal with mourning, understood in the psychoanalytic sense as grief-work (Trauerarbeit). Such work would seemingly be as pertinent to philosophical investigations (especially ones conducted by pragmatists) as to psychoanalytic explorations. Finding such themes as mourning and loss in R. W. Emerson's writings, Cavell warns against assimilating Emerson's voice to that of American pragmatism, especially Dewey's instrumentalism, for such assimilation risks the loss or repression of Emerson's voice in not only professional philosophy but also American culture. While granting Emerson's distinctive voice, this essay argues that the way Cavell insists on differences problematically represses recognition of the Emersonian strains in Dewey's own philosophical voice. In doing so, Cavell falsely flattens the resounding depth of Dewey's philosophical voice and narrows the expansive range of pragmatic intelligence. But Dewey all too often lends himself to such a misreading, for his writings at once repress and embody the strains of a distinctively Emersonian voice.<br>

Abstract: Cet article interroge les modes de production et de reproduction des récits de migration. Les histoires seront traitées non seulement comme sources de recherche ethnographique et comme enquête journalistique, mais aussi comme des moyens spécifiques de comprendre et de façonner l'expérience de la migration. De cette façon, nous viserons moins à alimenter un débat méthodologique sur l'usage des matériaux biographiques dans une recherche qualitative, qu'à mettre en lumière les multiples effets de ce phénomène sur la société, en termes de création d'une demande d'histoires de migration et, par conséquence, d'un véritable « marché de mots » où les migrants, qui ont acquis une solide maîtrise narrative, peuvent troquer leurs récits de vie contre une reconnaissance sociale, du prestige ou même de l'argent. This article studies the ways migration narratives are being produced and reproduced. Such stories shall be treated not only as sources of the ethnographical research and journalistic enquiry, but also as specific ways of understanding and shaping the experience of migration. This way I intend—more than feeding the methodological debate of how to use the biographical materials in a research—to highlight the multiple effects of this phenomenon over society, in terms of creation of a market of migrational stories. In this market, migrants, acting as true narrative experts, can exchange their stories for social recognition, prestige, or even money.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the ethical responsibilities of relating and responding to subjects of oppression in the context of collaborative life writing. One well-established ethical response to oppression is the practice of recognition. Drawing on the phenomenological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Paul Ricoeur, as well as the related work of Kelly Oliver, I raise some of the limitations of recognition, and delineate the ethical alternative of witnessing, bringing both to bear on my collaborative work with Holocaust survivor Rhodea Shandler.<br>

Abstract: The author argues that Casanova's journey to Venice constitutes not only a physical journey, but also an inner quest that brings significant insights. A close analysis of the dream sequence as a condensed version of the novella's plot reveals the protagonist's disillusionment with the obsolete public persona in which he is trapped, a reluctant recognition of an inner void, and a paralysis in his futile pursuit of a new identity, qualities which capture the fin-desiècle Viennese Weltanschauung.<br>

Author(s): Griffioen Sander<br>
Abstract: This is a study in the philosophy of worldview. It consists of two parts. The first part, which is presented here, is concerned primarily with key elements in the general structure of a worldview. It lays the groundwork for more concrete and differentiated investigations that will be pursued as a sequel to this article. The genius of the worldview notion is that it signifies both an inner conviction and an outlook on the world. Thus it combines the personal and the universal. Moreover, it does so in the context of conflicting convictions and outlooks. Accordingly, the plural worldviews is more adequate than the singular since each reflects the presence of the others. As I try to show, this inherent pluralism is what is missing both in traditional settings as well as under totalitarian regimes. The main body of this article consists of an analysis of four basic functions: 'orientation', 'assent' (i.e. a channeling of convictions), 'integration', and 'public recognition' (i.e. attaining recognition for a cause). A preceding section is dedicated to a delineation of worldview with respect to 'world picture'. Special attention is paid in this connection to 'embedded' worldviews: hybrid forms characteristic for our present 'post-worldview era'.<br>

Abstract: The struggles for recognition, focused on cultural and identity issues until recently, are returning to public arenas in the form of struggles for legal recognition, precisely when we are witnessing, in the context of the post-2008 economic recession, a downward review of citizenship rights, in particular social and labour rights. This article discusses this issue by: first, associating education to the struggles for legal recognition, using the «moral grammar of social conflicts» of Axel Honneth; second, showing how education, connected to empowerment, may have an interesting role in the qualification of social actors involved in these struggles; third, defining the major articulations of this educational role in terms of empowerment. The article concludes by demonstrating the strategic role of empowerment, when promoted by education, in the struggles against the recession of subjective or citizenship rights. Las luchas por el reconocimiento, centradas hasta hace poco en aspectos culturales e identitarios, vuelven al dominio público en forma de luchas por el reconocimiento legal, precisamente cuando estamos asistiendo, en el contexto de la recesión económica posterior a 2008, a una revisión a la baja de los derechos de ciudadanía, particularmente de los derechos sociales y laborales. Este artículo aborda este problema: primero, asociando la educación con las luchas por el reconocimiento legal, en base a la «gramática moral de los conflictos sociales» de Axel Honneth; segundo, mostrando cómo la educación, conectada con el empoderamiento, puede desempeñar un interesante papel en la cualificación de los actores sociales involucrados en estas luchas y, en tercer lugar, definiendo las principales expresiones de este papel de la educación en términos de empoderamiento. El artículo concluye demostrando el estratégico papel del empoderamiento, cuando es potenciado por la educación, en las luchas contra la recesión de los derechos subjetivos o de ciudadanía.<br>

Abstract: El presente trabajo analiza la forma de comprensión de los casos de aprobación y rechazo de acuerdos reparatorios en materias de violencia doméstica, cuando tanto la víctima como el imputado pertenecen al pueblo mapuche, que han sido resueltos desde el año 2011 por tribunales de la Región de La Araucanía. Se plantea que las formas de comprender estos casos por los tribunales y la doctrina no ha sido la correcta, por cuanto se han centrado en determinar la primacía exclusiva que tendría uno de los derechos en disputa por sobre el otro. Frente a ello, el artículo sugiere que la forma adecuada de entender estos conflictos multiculturales, y a la decisión judicial que se pronuncia sobre los mismos, es reconociendo el elemento "trágico" que se encuentra presente, y que se configura a partir de un reconocimiento de las características e importancia de los principios en colisión y de los bienes jurídicos que protegen. This paper analyzes the way of understanding the cases of approval and rejection of compensation agreements in matters of domestic violence, where both the victim and the accused belong to the Mapuche people, which have been resolved since 2011 by courts of the Araucanía Region. It argues that the ways of understanding these cases by the courts and the doctrine has not been proper, since ithas focused on determine the exclusive primacy that one of the colliding rights would have over the other. Facing this issue, the article suggests that the best way to understand these multicultural conflicts, and the judicial decision pronounced on them, is considering the "tragic" element present in these cases, which is configured from the recognition of the characteristics and importance of the principles in collision and the legal goods they protect.<br>

Article Title: The Reception of Hayden White<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Goekjian Richard T.<br>
Abstract: Evaluation of the influence of Hayden White on the theory of history is made difficult by his preference for the essay form, valued for its experimental character, and by the need to find comparable data. A quantitative study of citations of his work in English and foreign-language journals, 1973-1993, reveals that although historians were prominent among early readers of Metahistory, few historical journals reviewed White's two subsequent collections of essays and few historians-except in Germany-cited them. Those historians who did tended still to cite Metahistory and often the parts of it devoted specifically to nineteenth-century historians. Literary critics, on the other hand, were relatively late to discover White, but during the "narrative turn" of the 1970s and 1980s his work was important for students of the novel and the theater. Recognition of it was especially marked in Spanish-speaking countries and in Germany. As a result, salient themes of White's later work-the ideological and political import of narrativization, the "historical sublime," and writing in the "middle voice"-have largely gone unremarked by historians and philosophers. Both these groups have tended to be irritated by White's bracketing of questions of historical epistemology; some have accused him of effacing the line between fiction and history, while White's numerous literary readers have generally applauded his tendencies in this direction. White however has consistently maintained that there is a difference, although not the one conventionally postulated. His exploration of writing in the "middle voice" brings his work full circle, in that it promises a "modernist" realism appropriate for representing the "sublime" events of our century.<br>

Author(s): Taylor Janelle S.<br>
Abstract: The onset of dementia raises troubling questions. Does the person with dementia still recognize you? If someone cannot recognize you, can they still care about you? This essay takes such questions as the entry point for a broader inquiry into recognition, its linkages to care, and how claims to social and political "recognition" are linked to, or premised on, the demonstrated capacity to "recognize" people and things. In the words and actions of her severely impaired mother, the author finds guidance toward a better, more compassionate question to ask about dementia: how can we best strive to "keep the cares together"?<br>

Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>

Author(s): Schwartz Barry<br>
Abstract: Oneness refers to the convention of recognizing a single individual's performance and ignoring others, including those who may have performed as well. Although oneness is an adaptation to cognitive deficits, it cannot be explained by them. If long-term and working memory were more capacious, society's need for ideals to establish realm-specific standards and meanings would tend to limit recognition and renown to one individual. The apotheosis of Rosa Parks is a case in point. Her celebrity and the obscurity of others who risked and accomplished more than she are two aspects of the same social process. Revealing oneness to be a social imperative, this case study leads to a broader understanding of collective forgetting.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25619787<br>
Date: 8 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Article Title: Language and the Making of Place: A Narrative-Descriptive Approach<br>
Publisher: Association of American Geographers<br>
Issue: i323950<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Tuan Yi-Fu<br>
Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Publisher: Rodopi<br>
Issue: i25781274<br>
Date: 1 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Abbott H. Porter<br>
Abstract: Beckett's aggressiveness in crossing generic lines paradoxically accompanied a keen sensitivity to genre and medium differences that often constrained his writing. My argument here is that this combination of abandon and respect was founded in a recognition not just of formal differences in art but of differences in the ways we think. In the wake of groundbreaking work by Jerry Fodor and Howard Gardner, there has been a great deal of research advancing (and qualifying) a modular conception of how the mind evolved and how it continues to work in modern humans. This work puts new light on both the formal differences between mimesis and diegesis, and on Beckett's approach to these two different ways of rendering narrative. Particularly it makes clear why Beckett should have so radically subordinated character and action to staged diegesis in his later work.<br>

Article Title: Die Entwicklung zum Postmodernismus in der Sozialwissenschaft<br>
Publisher: Dietrich Reimer Verlag<br>
Issue: i25842884<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Scheuch Erwin K.<br>
Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Anderson Pamela Sue<br>
Abstract: I begin with the assumption that a philosophically significant tension exists today in feminist philosophy of religion between those subjects who seek to become divine and those who seek their identity in mutual recognition. My critical engagement with the ambiguous assertions of Luce Irigaray seeks to demonstrate, on the one hand, that a woman needs to recognize her own identity but, on the other hand, that each subject whether male or female must struggle in relation to the other in order to maintain realism about life and death. No one can avoid the recognition that we are each given life but each of us also dies. In addition, I raise a more general, philosophical problem for analytic philosophers who attempt to read Continental philosophy of religion: how should philosophers interpret deliberately ambiguous assertions? For example, what does Irigaray mean in asserting, 'Divinity is what we need to become free, autonomous, sovereign'? To find an answer, I turn to the distinctively French readings of the Hegelian struggle for recognition which have preoccupied Continental philosophers especially since the first half of the last century. I explore the struggle for mutual recognition between women and men who must face the reality of life and death in order to avoid the projection of their fear of mortality onto the other sex. This includes a critical look at Irigaray's account of subjectivity and divinity. I turn to the French philosopher Michèle Le Doeuff in order to shift the focus from divinity to intersubjectivity. I conclude that taking seriously the struggle for mutual recognition between subjects forces contemporary philosophers of religion to be realist in their living and dying. With this in mind, the lesson from the Continent for philosophy of religion is that we must not stop yearning for recognition. Indeed, we must even risk our autonomy/divinity in seeking to recognize intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte est une réaction contre la racialisation croissante des phénomènes sociaux qui est opérée aujourd'hui dans la société française en général et dans les sciences sociales en particulier. Une tendance dont l'émergence d'une « question noire » et d'un des principaux corollaires de celle-ci (au moins pour ce qui est des populations des départements d'Outre-mer), l'activation d'une mémoire de l'esclavage des « nègres », sont ici considérées comme un exemple des plus significatifs. Cette tendance se développe au risque que soient occultés ou, pour le moins, travestis les enjeux, les stratégies et les mécanismes proprement sociaux qui sont au fondement des discriminations racistes qu'affrontent effectivement les « Noirs » en France et que soient finalement brisées — sous le poids de la concurrence de victimes de l'histoire exigeant réparation — les solidarités transcommunautaires de diverses sortes qui, seules, peuvent enrayer ces discriminations et les dynamiques les déterminant. Elle a pour un de ses principaux moteurs des stratégies d'élites qui, toutes, consistent à constituer le racialisme en un moyen d'ascension sociale. Des stratégies dans lesquelles et pour lesquelles des groupes d'individus — convenablement dotés en capitaux de différentes sortes (économique, culturel et « racial ») — se révèlent donc particulièrement aptes à capter à leur seul profit les mobilisations identitaires ou mémorielles qu'ils ont souvent contribué à déclencher mais dont d'autres, moins bien dotés, forment la grande masse des fantassins. Concernant les populations des départements d'Outre-mer, les stratégies en question sont portées par des élites nationalistes ou indigénistes en mal de reconnaissance et renvoient à une même logique argumentative qui, sous couvert d'une dénonciation de l'aliénation coloniale (sous les espèces de « l'aveuglement à la couleur » ou de « l'oubli généralisé de l'esclavage »), est opposée à tous ceux qui, désireux de construire une citoyenneté français~<br>

Abstract: Two arguments apparently support the thesis that collective identity presupposes an Other: the recognition argument, according to which seeing myself as a self requires recognition by an other whom I also recognize as a self (Hegel); and the dialogic argument, according to which my sense of self can only develop dialogically (Taylor). But applying these arguments to collective identity involves a compositional fallacy. Two modern ideologies mask the particularist thesis's falsehood. The ideology of indivisible state sovereignty makes sovereignty as such appear particularistic by fusing "internal" with "external" sovereignty; nationalism imagines national identity as particularistic by linking it to sovereignty. But the concatenation of internal sovereignty, external sovereignty, and nation is contingent. Schmitt's thesis that "the political" presupposes an other conflates internal and external sovereignty, while Mouffe's neo-Schmittianism conflates difference (Derrida) with alterity. A shared global identity may face many obstacles, but metaphysical impossibility and conceptual confusion are not among them.<br>

Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Abstract: Progressive constitutional scholarship has yet fully to confront the implications of the conservative shift in constitutional law. Liberal critics continue to seek governing constitutional theories with which to constrain decisionmaking by judges of a notably different mind. Other, more radical scholars employ the indeterminacy and "law is politics" critiques in a more open attempt at displacement. Neither approach is viable, however. Each presumes the primacy of the autonomous, self-directing subject; each resists recognition of the situated nature of all human endeavor. This essay adopts the alternative strategy: exploring the implications of situatedness as they apply to the development, practice, and attempted reconstruction of modern constitutional law. After evaluating the lessons of history, the essay suggests a reconceptualization of "constitutional politics" which better reflects the parameters that both limit and enable change. It explores the possibilities for reconstruction through revisionist readings of three familiar cases-West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, Brown v. Board of Education, and Griswold v. Connecticut. These rereadings reveal not only that the recognition of situatedness and its constitutional implications are already a part of the canon, but also that they are the very center of modern constitutional concern.<br>

Abstract: During the German Kaiserreich, urban expansion and social segregation fostered new mechanisms of indirect and delegated gift-exchange in which the mediations between donors and recipients became increasingly important. In urban societies, mediators were in greater demand than ever before to act as System builders in forging connections between civil society, the municipality, and the State, coordinating private philanthropic initiatives and institutionalizing the resources available for patronage. This paper draws on theories of gift exchange and of social recognition in order to overcome the false dichotomy of interest v. morality in philanthropic action. The cases of failed patrons, competing mediators of culture and disregarded outsiders may illustrate why the history of philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries cannot simply be regarded as a success story of middle-class civil society.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, I draw on the mutually implicated structures of tragedy and self-formation found in Hegel's use of Sophocles' Antigone in the Phenomenology. By emphasizing the apparent distinction between particular and universal in Hegel's reading of the tragedies in Antigone, I propose that a tragedy of action (which particularizes a universal) is inescapable for subjectivity understood as socially constituted and always already socially engaged. I consider universal/particular relations in three communities: Hegel's Greek polis, his community of conscience, and my reading of certain feminist communities. The position I propose establishes a ground from which to approach subjects, and implies that all subjects may be understood as the result of relations embodying potential tragedy. This speaks to contemporary concerns about marginalization, identity articulation, and relations of recognition.<br>

Abstract: The quest for recognition of subjectivity and human dignity is at the heart of current social activism. Africans have struggled for recognition since they were stripped of human dignity, first by the slave trade and later by colonialism. Their struggle has been revealed essentially through writing and monotheism. This article suggests looking at the performative elaboration of the self. On the continent as well as in the diaspora, the construction of the subjectivity and dignity of the modern African / black person is represented in all its autonomy. The empirical example chosen is that of Central Africa. /// La quête pour la reconnaissance de la subjectivité et la dignité est au coeur des mouvements sociaux actuels. Les Africains se battent pour obtenir la reconnaissance depuis l'époque où la traite des esclaves et plus tard la colonisation les ont dépouillés de leurs qualités humaines. Ces combats ont été essentiellement révélés par l'écriture et le monothéisme. L'article actuel suggère aux lecteurs de considérer la construction performative du moi où la subjectivité Africaine / Noire est représentée dans toute son autonomie. L'exemple empirique proposé est celui de l'Afrique centrale.<br>

Abstract: African American quiltmaking began to gain recognition as an expressive form distinct from European American quiltmaking in the countercultural climate of the 1970s. Representations of it since then have served to update the Eurocentric, patriotic image of quiltmaking in the United States with components ofmulticulturalism and cultural critique. These representations in turn caused tensions along the lines of class, race, gender, and scholarly discipline. This study shows the power of words and things when used together, as in museum exhibits, to affirm or challenge the existing social order.<br>

Abstract: The impact of modernity, the recognition of which was central to ethnographic testimony, has been challenged by self-referential cultural criticism. A growing awareness of cultural representations has been advocated within the frame of narrative ethnology. This shift towards understanding and interpretation is pointing not only to an ethnographic dialogue, as it has been suggested, but also to cultural relativism. Furthermore, as a result of conflicting interpretations, there has been a tendency to overemphasize the diversity of cultural identities. Instead of hallowing relativistic claims for "readability," more realistic attempts have to be made towards complex situations facing the intricacies of contemporean modern life.<br>

Abstract: Ambient Intelligence is a vision of a future in which autonomie smart environments take an unprecedented number of decisions both for the private and the public good. It involves a shift to automated pattern recognition, a new paradigm in the construction of knowledge. This will fundamentally affect our lives, increasing specific types of errors, loss of autonomy and privacy, unfair discrimination and stigmatisation, and an absence of due process. Current law's articulation in the technology of the printed script is inadequate in the face of the new type of knowledge generation. A possible solution is to articulate legal protections within the socio-technical infrastructure. In particular, both privacy-enhancing and transparency-enhancing technologies must be developed that embed legal rules in ambient technologies themselves. This vision of Ambient Law' requires a novel approach to law making which addresses the challenges of technology, legitimacy, and political-legal theory. Only a constructive and collaborative effort to migrate law from books to other technologies can ensure that Ambient Law becomes reality, safeguarding the fundamental values underlying privacy, identity, and democracy in tomorrows ambient intelligent world.<br>

Abstract: Le combat juif pour la mémoire du génocide et la reconnaissance finalement obtenue sont devenus un modèle et un cadre référentiel pour d'autres populations persécutées. Mais l'ampleur de cette effervescence mémorielle suscite à son tour des réactions critiques. Quant au modèle, il est parfois contesté de façon virulente par la dérive minoritaire d'une compétition victimaire. Après avoir rappelé le processus à travers lequel ce phénomène mémoriel s'est progressivement imposé, on analysera son rôle référentiel, les critiques qu'il soulève et les controverses dont il fait l'objet. The Jewish fight for the genocide's memory and the recognition it eventually reached have become a model and a referential frame for other persecuted people. Yet in return some react critically to this rising memorial effervescence. As victims compete and minorities conflict, the Shoah model is in itself more and more contested. This article retraces how this memorial phenomenon has progressively settled and analyses its referential, yet controversial, role. Der jüdische Kampf um eine kollektive Erinnerung an die Vernichtung und ihre letztliche Anerkennung sind im Laufe der Zeit zu einer Art Modell und zu einem Bezugsrahmen für andere verfolgte Bevölkerungsgruppen geworden. Jedoch erzeugt die Omnipräsenz der Erinnerungen vielfach auch Kritik. Das Erinnerungsmodell wird von Seiten bestimmter Minderheitenströmungen innerhalb des herrschenden « Opferwettbewerbs » oftmals heftig angegriffen. Zunächst analysiert dieser Artikel den Prozess der Durchsetzung des Phänomens des Sich-Erinnerns, im Anschluss daran wird seine Referenzwirkung diskutiert sowie die Kritik und die Debatte die es hervorruft.<br>

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to show that so-called conventional metaphors play a twofold role in discourse. We distinguish two sub-groups of so-called conventional metaphors (semi-denatured and denatured metaphors) depending on whether or not we still perceive the conceptual contrast generated when the conventional metaphor was a genuine metaphor. On the one hand, the choice of some sample of denatured conventional metaphor reflects the same about our ideology as what the choice of a literally used expression does, the original conceptual contrast is not retrievable. On the other hand, the use of a semi-denatured metaphor exploits the recognition of an ideological change, its use reflects the consolidation of the conceptual restructuring that took place when it was a metaphor. Semi-denatured metaphors show how reality and ideology have been in part constructed by the metaphorical use of language.<br>

Abstract: Quatre recueils récents comportant des contributions de philosophes allemands et américains permettent de préciser et discuter les grandes questions soulevées aujourd'hui par diverses traditions de lecture de Hegel, en particulier, la question d'une lecture morale de la « reconnaissance » dans la Phénoménologie de l'esprit, la théorie de la connaissance, le statut de la beauté. Four recent collections offering contributions by German and American philoso­phers allow us to discuss with greater precision the major questions raised today by different traditions of reading Hegel, notably in regard to the question of a moral reading of the concept of "recognition" in the Phenomenology of the mind, the theory of knowledge, the status of beauty.<br>

Abstract: How did cultural dynamics help bring about the societies we now recognize as modern? This article constructs seven distinct models for how structures of signification and social meaning participated in the transitions to modernity in the West and, in some of the models, across the globe. Our models address: (1) the spread, via imitation, of modern institutions around the world (memetic replication); (2) the construal, by socio-cultural forces and by state organizations, of the modern citizensubject (social subjectification); (3) the continual search for new meanings to replace traditional religious meaning-systems (compensatory reenchantment); (4) repeated attempts, in modern revolutions, to remake society completely, according to a Utopian vision (ideological totalization); (5) the cultural origins and social consequences of scientific and humanistic worldviews (epistemic rift); (6) the gendered politics of state formation (patriarchal supercession); (7) the invention and production of race in the colonial encounter (racial recognition). We explicate the models in reverse chronological order, because in our synthesis, we argue that the original modern break results from a dynamic combination of racial recognition, patriarchal supercession, and epistemic rift; these changes set the stage for the four other processes we theorize. In addition to our synthesis, we also consider, from a more neutral perspective, the kinds of causal arguments upon which these models tend to rely, and thus explicate the analytical undergirding for the application of any of these models to empirical research on transitions to modernity. Throughout the article, we consider how these models might, and might not, mesh with other families of explanation, such as the politico-economic.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Abstract: C'est dans la Poétique d'Aristote que se trouve une méthode pour reconnaître le mal en politique. Ce que livre la « reconnaissance » issue de la réflexion poétique tient déjà à trois choses : le temps que prend le travail d'un aveu de soi à soi; la posture rhétorique double de délégation-consolation et de dévoilement plénier ; le joint du mal personnel et du mal public. Cette poétique est au cœur du phénomène de réconciliation en Afrique du Sud après la fin de l'apartheid, dans les travaux de la Commission Vérité et Réconciliation : une poétique de la réconciliation. It is in the Poetics of Aristotle that can be found a method for recognizing evil in politics. The "recognition" that is furnished by poetic reflection stems from three things: the time taken by the process of confession from self to self; the double rhetorical posture of delegation-consolation and complete exposure; the conjunction of personal evil and public evil. That poetic is at the heart of the phenomenon of reconciliation in South Africa after the end of apartheid, in the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: a poetic of reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: À La Réunion, l'école de la Troisième République s'est investie dans un processus d'acculturation nationale où les valeurs patriotiques et civiques ont été mises à l'honneur. L'affermissement du sentiment d'appartenance nationale s'est donc inscrit progressivement dans un patrio-bellicisme et dans une reconnaissance des bienfaits de la Nation pour les jeunes élèves de la colonie. Le lycée de Saint-Denis, établissement modèle accueillant les élites réunionnaises, a été l'objet à cet égard d'une attention particulière de la part des autorités coloniales. Durant la remise des prix effectuée chaque année avant les vacances scolaires, les élèves recevaient ainsi une dernière leçon édifiante d'instruction civique rappelant les fondements de la Nation et les devoirs inhérents au patriotisme. In Reunion Island, the School system of the Third Republic initiated a process of national cultural integration in which patriotic and civic values were promoted. As a result, the strengthened feeling of national belonging gradually developed into a patriotic/warmongering spirit and the recognition of the benefits brought by the nation in the minds of the young students of the colony. The Saint-Denis upper secondary school, a model school in which the colony elite studied, was therefore the object of particular attention from colonial authorities. Thus, during the prize ceremony held each year before the holiday break, pupils were taught a final lesson of civic responsibility with a reminder of the foundations of the nation and the duties inherent to patriotism. Auf der Insel Réunion, hat die Schule der Dritten Republik ein nationaler Akkulturationsprozess entwickelt, der die staatlich-patriotischen Werte in den Vordergrund brach. Die Befestigung des nationalen Zugehörigkeitsgefühls fällt dadurch schrittweise in einen kriegerischen Patriotismus und in die Erkennung der Wohltaten der Nation zugunsten der jungen Schüler der Kolonie.

Abstract: La problématique de la reconnaissance que Ricoeur développe dans son ultime ouvrage n'est pas seulement un nouveau chantier philosophique qu'il ouvre à ses lecteurs. Une lecture rétrospective de son oeuvre découvre que cette thématique est le dernier fruit de l'herméneutique des symboles développée dans les années 60 et de l'herméneutique du soi exposée dans Soi-même comme un autre. Une interprétation systématique des trois études du Parcours de la reconnaissance montre quel sens la formule : « Je me suis reconnu philosophe » revêtirait dans la bouche de Ricœur. The topic of recognition that Ricoeur develops in his final work does not only open a whole new field of inquiry for his readers. A retrospective reading of his work discovers that this theme is the last fruit of the hermeneutics of symbols developped during the 1960s and of the hermeneutics of the self examined in Oneself as Another. A systemic interpretation of the three studies included in Parcours de la reconnaissance shows the meaning that the phrase « I recognized myself as a philosopher » would take on according to Ricœur.<br>

Article Title: La validation des acquis de l'expérience est-elle un moyen de reconnaissance du travail? / Is the process of granting equivalences based on work-related experiences a way to recognize the work performed?<br>

Abstract: Cet article interroge la validation des acquis de l'expérience, droit instauré en 2002 dans le Code du travail, sur sa capacité à favoriser une meilleure reconnaissance du travail des salariés. Il s'appuie sur une enquête réalisée auprès de 15 entreprises, associations ou branches professionnelles engagées dans des opérations collectives de validation des acquis de l'expérience (VAE). Après avoir identifié quatre logiques distinctes de mise en œuvre du dispositif par les employeurs, les auteurs examinent les canaux par lesquels la VAE, telle qu'elle se pratique dans l'entreprise, pourrait favoriser la reconnaissance du travail. D'un côté, la mise en mots du travail est un puissant moyen de le rendre visible et l'opportunité de confrontation avec les pairs permet de renforcer l'identité professionnelle, mais de l'autre, la VAE influe peu sur la rémunération et l'ambiguïté demeure fréquente sur l'objet même de la validation. Le regard croisé des employeurs et des salariés montre donc à quel point la reconnaissance du travail ne va pas de soi. Mais la voie est tracée pour qu'il puisse en être autrement dans le cadre de procédures plus négociées, notamment avec l'acteur syndical. Based on a survey conducted in 15 firms, associations or occupations where work-based experiences were being validated under the terms of a law that entered the French Labor Code in 2002, questions are raised about this process and its capacity for obtaining more recognition for the work done by wage-earners. After identifying four distinct employer rationales for implementing validation, the channels favoring the obtainment of such recognition are examined when this procedure is actually applied inside firms. Putting one's job into words is a powerful means for making it visible; and the opportunity to face colleagues is an occasion for reinforcing an occupational identity. Nonetheless, validation has little effect on pay, and what is being validated is often ambiguous. Employers' and wage-ear~<br>

Author(s): BLACK Max<br>
Abstract: An elaboration and defense of the "interaction view of metaphor" introduced in the author's earlier study, "Metaphor" (1962). Special attention is paid to the explication of the metaphors used in the earlier account. The topics discussed include: selection of the "targets" of the theory; classification of metaphors; how metaphorical statements work; relations between metaphors and similes; metaphorical thought; criteria of recognition; the "creative" aspects of metaphors; the ontological status of metaphors. Metaphors are found to be more closely connected with background models than has previously been recognized. Elaboration et défense de la « conception interactive de la métaphore » présentée par l'auteur dans une étude antérieure Metaphor (1962). Une attention particulière est vouée à l'explication des exemples de métaphores utilisés dans la précédente étude. Les sujets discutés comprennent: sélection des buts de la théorie; classification des métaphores; comment fonctionnent les énoncés métaphoriques; relations entre-métaphores et termes voisins; pensée métaphorique; critères de reconnaissance; les aspects « créatifs » des métaphores; le statut ontologique des métaphores. Les métaphores apparaissent comme étant plus étroitement liées à des modèles sous-jacents qu'on ne l'avait précédemment soupçonné. Es handelt sich um eine Ausarbeitung und Verteidigung der «interaction view of metaphor», die der Autor schon in einer früheren Arbeit, Metaphor (1962), vertreten hat. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit wird der Erklärung von Metaphern geschenkt, die in der früheren Betrachtung verwendet worden sind. Unter den diskutierten Fragen finden wir: Auswahl der «Ziele» der Theorie; die Klassifikation der Metaphern; die Art des Funktionierens von metaphorischen Aussagen; die Beziehungen zwischen Metaphern und Vergleichen; das metaphorische Denken; Kriterien für den Entscheid, wann wir es mit einer Metapher zu tun haben; die «schöpferischen» Aspekte von Metaphern; der ontologische Sta~<br>

Abstract: Voulant résoudre l'énigme de la connaissance, Husserl est aux prises, dans Expérience et Jugement, avec la genèse transcendantale des formes predicatives. Celles-ci renvoient à la structure de l'expérience sensible dans sa double dimension : passive et active. C'est activement que le sujet percevant saisit et « détaille » un objet perçu en ses moments déterminants (ex.« une boule sphérique et rouge »). Au cours de l'expérience sensible se constituent des « types » qui rendent possible la reconnaissance d'un objet sous telle ou telle catégorie. Sur ce trajet, non exempt de seuils à franchir, qui va du « sens » perçu à la signification langagière, nous essayons de montrer quelle place pourrait être assignée à la nomination dans une perspective husserlienne. In his attempt to resolve the enigma of knowledge, in Experience and Judgement Husserl undertakes the task of describing the transcendantal genesis of the predicative forms. These forms refer back to the structures of receptivity with its two dimensions, passive and active. The perceiver actively grasps and « details » the perceived object in its determining moments (parts or qualities : « spherical », « red » ...). Throughout sensible experience « types » and « typical structures » are constituted, which make possible the recognition of an objet under this or that category. On the way, not without crossing certain thresholds, going from the perceived « sense » to the linguistically expressed meaning, we try to show which place may be assigned to naming within the framework of an Husserlian phenomenology.<br>

Author(s): THOUARD Denis<br>
Abstract: Si l'on admet que l'herméneutique part de la reconnaissance d'une intention de signifier donnée déposée dans des signes, force est de considérer que l'entreprise kantienne s'y oppose, aussi bien d'un point de vue systématique que d'un point de vue historique. On critiquera à cette occasion la tentative de tirer du kantisme, en particulier de la troisième Critique, un point de départ pour une herméneutique. L'étude de « l'herméneutique morale » de l'écrit sur la religion replacé dans le contexte de la critique biblique de son époque apporte une confirmation des analyses systématiques et souligne les limites du dispositif kantien. Les reproches adressés par les tenants de « l'école mythique » de Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) à la Religion dans les limites de la simple raison reviennent à distinguer nettement jugement et interprétation : Kant met en oeuvre un jugement, et non une interprétation. If one admits that the starting point of hermeneutics is a recognition of an intention to signify facts left in signs, then one must recognize that the project of Kant is opposed to this starting point, both from a systematic and historical point of view. The temptation to take from the works of Kant, especially the Third Critique, a starting point for hermeneutics will be subject to analysis. A study of « moral hermeneutics » that is drawn from the texts of religion (and which is done within the context of the biblical criticism of their period) confirms the analysis et underlines the limits of the Kantian plan of action. The criticisms of the « l'école mythique » of Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) aimed at Religion within the limits of simple reason aid to clearly distinguish between judgement and interpretation. Kant implements a judgment and not an interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Comme n'importe quel éditeur scientifique, l'économiste qui entend diffuser les écrits de ses prédécesseurs est confronté à une problématique invariable : publier quoi et comment, par delà le choix de qui. Les difficultés posées par cette problématique, dans le champ de notre discipline, ne se distinguent pas radicalement de celles qui interviennent dans d'autres domaines, y compris en littérature. Certes, le traitement de ces difficultés mobilise à de nombreux égards des compétences qui ne sont habituellement pas l'apanage de l'historien de la pensée économique, mais il requiert aussi des capacités analytiques que ce dernier a coutume de reconnaître comme les siennes propres. Il demeure que l'activité editoriale est une pratique savante à laquelle l'historien de la pensée économique n'accorde ordinairement que peu d'attention. Pourtant, puisque la littérature primaire dont s'alimente notre discipline est ici en jeu, l'affirmation institutionnelle et la diffusion de celle-ci dépendent d'une telle pratique. Like any other scientific editor, the economist who intends to spread the writings of his predecessors is faced with constant problems, beyond the question of who he will publish: what he should publish and how he should publish it. In the field of our discipline, the difficulties raised by these questions are not radically different from those which occur in other disciplines, including literature. Of course, in many respects dealing with these difficulties implies skills which are not usually the prerogative of the historian of economic thought. Nevertheless it also requires analytical abilities that the latter is in the habit of regarding as being his own. The fact remains that editing is a scholarly practice to which the historian of economic thought usually pays little attention. However, since the primary source materials that continue to be the foundation for research in our academic discipline are here at stake, its institutional recognition and spread dep~<br>

Abstract: Les conceptions épistémologiques de Rousseau affectent ses perceptions et son discours sur la politique. L'accord de Rousseau avec la critique moderne des idées innées et son désaccord avec le monisme matérialiste dans la psychologie empirique ne rendent pas seulement compte de la manière (ou méthode) par laquelle Rousseau perçoit la politique, mais aussi du remplacement de l'idée classique de la raison pratique par les principes formels d'égalité et de liberté comme principes du jugement politique. La reconnaissance par Rousseau des limites du formalisme, comme étant le motif d'une pratique individuelle, explique son emploi d'artifices à la fois rhétoriques et poétiques, servant à donner une substance dynamique aux « formes » que son enseignement préconise. Sa vision politique devient ainsi une synthèse ingénieuse du formalisme mathématique et de l'aisthesis poétique. Rousseau's epistemological conceptions affect his perceptions and discourse on politics. Rousseau's agreement with the modern criticism of inate ideas and his disagreement with materialist monism in empirical psychology do not only account for the manner (or method) in which Rousseau perceives of politics, but also the replacement of the classical idea of practical reason by formal principles of equality and liberty as principles of political judgement. Rousseau's recognition of the limits of formalism as the grounds for individual practice explains his use of both rhetorical and poetic devices which give dynamic substance to the " forms " envisaged by his teaching. His political vision thus becomes an ingenious synthesis of mathematical formalism and poetical aisthesis.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Article Title: Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Dual Economy of Recognition<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Article Title: Cinematic Shocks: Recognition, Aesthetic Experience, and Phenomenology<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Hanich Julian<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest that we, as human beings, gain personal recognition not only through intersubjective encounters with others, but also through aesthetic experience. To support my claims about what I call 'aesthetic recognition,' I focus on a pervasive but rarely explored phenomenon: the cinematic shock. Not only a staple ingredient of thrillers, horror films, and disaster movies, it is also found in art-films. The cinematic shock will serve as the case in point of my argument because in its lived intensity, density, and conspicuousness we can describe it more easily with appropriate words than other aesthetic experiences that are equally able to foster aesthetic recognition but are less readily accessible via language. When experienced in the social environment of the movie theater, cinematic shocks enable two widespread types of aesthetic recognition: aesthetic experience as individual self-recognition, and aesthetic experience as a collective recognition of accord. Due to the strongly affective lived-body experience brought about by an encounter with the aesthetic object, the recipient not only feels self-aware of and self-affirmed in his or her own embodied existence, he or she also experiences confirmation as part of a group responding equally—in accordance—to an aesthetic object. This double recognition gained from the cinematic experience of shock derives from the individual film experience and the collective theatrical experience. An additional outcome of my methodological reliance on dense phenomenological descriptions may be an argument for the value of phenomenology in both the study of film and of aesthetics more generally.<br>

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Kley Antje<br>
Abstract: This essay is a contribution towards a more systematic consideration of the relation between recognition and autonomy in literary and cultural studies. The readings presented here rest on two premises: First, I assume that literary texts negotiate recognition in ways different from and not completely accessible to philosophy and the social sciences; and second, that the individualistic language of liberalism, which is preoccupied with autonomy and dependence, changes depending on how recognition is negotiated. Both Edward P. Jones's neo-slave narrative The Known World and Richard Powers's novel of ideas The Echo Maker stage historically and socially specific convergences of autonomy and dependence in their depictions of precarious subjectivity. The Known World, situated in the mid-nineteenth-century slave South, shows how the liberal ideal of self-mastery is implicitly linked to the mastery of others as chattel slaves. The Echo Maker, set in the early twenty-first-century Midwest, stages another form of precariousness that in some ways answers the questions of submission and self-mastery raised in the other novel. It suggests an at once more democratic and more literary model of individuality that does not depend on ownership so much as on the logic of storytelling. The novels project distinct diegetic worlds and rely on divergent generic patterns; in exploring the logics of possessive individualism and a more democratic model of storytelling respectively, they offer contingent concepts of agency that are dependent for their private and public stabilizations on very different forms of recognition of the other.<br>

Abstract: In the past decades the concept of recognition has moved to the center of social theory. Can this concept be of use for American Studies and, more specifically, American literary and cultural studies? My essay tries to answer this question in five parts: first, a discussion of two opposite views of the social and cultural role of recognition exemplified by Charles Taylor and Alexis de Tocqueville; second, a reconsideration of the concept of identity, since recognition is inextricably linked with questions of identity formation in current debates; third, a description of the ways in which the struggle for recognition stands at the center of fictional texts and forms an imaginary core that has often been forgotten in the professionalization of literary studies; fourth, an analysis of how recognition can be understood and described as an effect of the reading experience (and of aesthetic experience more generally); and fifth, a return to the starting question of this essay, namely what the concept of recognition can contribute to American Studies and how it can be assessed in comparison with other, currently dominant approaches in the field.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur interroge la thèse de Joseph Weiler, juriste juif américain, spécialiste de droit européen, en faveur de l'idée d'une Europe chrétienne et la met en corrélation avec la théorie éthique de Robert Spaemann, philosophe de conviction catholique, au sujet de la catégorie de personne. Il en résulte des questions critiques, dans le sens d'une éthique de la reconnaissance et de la reconstruction (Jean-Marc Ferry) et d'une plus grande valorisation du théologique comme tel au sein de l'espace public. The author looks at the thesis of Joseph Weiler, a Jewish American jurist specializing in European law and favouring the idea of a Christian Europe, and juxtaposes it to the ethics theory of Robert Spaemann, a Catholic philosopher, with regards to the category of personhood. There result some critical questions in the direction of an ethics of recognition and reconstruction (Jean-Marc Ferry) and of greater value given to the theological as such in the public sphere.<br>

Abstract: La relation entre spiritualisme et philosophie réflexive peut donner lieu à deux lectures inverses : ou bien la méthode reflexive trouve son fondement dans la reconnaissance de la réalité de l'esprit, ou bien c'est la pratique réflexive qui autorise et au besoin contrôle la portée des affirmations spiritualistes. L'article se situe dans cette seconde lignée. La précession de l'être par l'être qui définit la condition de la conscience ne légitime aucune intuition de l'Absolu, mais bien une affirmation ontologique originaire. L'âme, c'est la passion d'intériorité de cette auto-affirmation manifestante. Quant à l'Esprit, troisième dimension de l'être, c'est un Advenir éthique qui n'est en acte qu'à travers le monde des êtres, dans la rencontre réflexive multilatérale des consciences. The relationship between spiritualism and philosophical reflexivity can be seen in one of two ways: either a recognition of the reality of the spirit gave rise to the reflexive concept, or the practice of reflexivity came first and widened the scope of spiritual affirmations, controlling them when necessary. The article favours the latter view. The ability of a being to form a judgment about itself, and thus create a conscience, does not justify any conclusion about an Absolute, being on the contrary one of the basic statements of ontology. The soul is the result of this active self-judgment emerging from its seclusion. As for the spirit, the third component of the being, this is an ethical by-product which only comes into play through the world of beings, in the multilateral reflexive meeting of consciences.<br>

Abstract: De François Wahl à Jürgen Habermas, la critique de la cratologie de Foucault a beaucoup évolué. Mais si Foucault n'apparaît plus comme un phénoménologue honteux de la volonté de puissance, trahissant ses prétentions structuralistes, il reste quand même un penseur ambigu qui, à la manière de Heidegger, élabore un discours « empirico - existentiel » à l'aide de catégories « historico-transcendantales ». Pourtant, si la critique habermassienne a le mérite d'attirer l'attention sur un trait central de la modernité que Foucault laisse de côté — la « solidification » des structures collectives —, elle ne nous offre pas, comme la critique de Foucault, les moyens de résister au processus d'intégration et de cristallisation des structures modernes, mais semble plutôt entériner la suprématie du savoir moderne de la contrainte par les structures institutionnelles. Pour notre part, nous pensons qu'une philosophie politique doit répondre, à notre époque, au problème relevé par Habermas avec les méthodes de contestation employées par Foucault. Cette philosophie politique devra même tenir compte, en tant que reflet de la situation actuelle, de l'ignorance de Foucault quant au problème crucial de la logique institutionnelle moderne et du refus par Habermas de toute critique qui vise à produire un conflit avec la logique dominante d'intégration. From François Wahl to Jürgen Habermas, criticisms of Foucault's theory of power have evolved considerably. But although Foucault may no longer be seen as a phenomenologist ashamed of his preoccupation about power, thus undermining his structuralist prétentions, he nevertheless remains an ambiguous thinker who, in the manner of Heidegger, elaborates an empirico-existential argument with the help of historico-transcendental classifications. However, if Habermas's criticism has the merit of drawing attention to a basic feature of modernity which Foucault leaves aside — namely the "solidification" of collective structures — it fails to offer, as~<br>

Abstract: Rompant avec la quasi-unanimité de la philosophie occidentale, de Platon à Marx, laquelle a conçu le pouvoir en termes de pouvoir-sur, de domination de l'homme sur l'homme, H. A. propose de le penser autrement, comme expression de l'aptitude d'un groupe à agir en condition de pluralité de façon concertée, et donc comme pouvoir-en-commun. L'A. différencie soigneusement le pouvoir, qui trouve en lui-même sa propre fin, d'avec la violence, d'ordre instrumental, qui n'est jamais légitime, et d'avec l'autorité, qui présuppose la reconnaissance inconditionnelle et le respect. Elle se demande finalement si tout pouvoir peut se passer du facteur de durabilité qu'est l'autorité d'une fondation. In breaking with the near unanimity of Western Philosophy which, from Plato to Marx, had conceived of power in terms of "power over," of a domination of humans over humans, H. A. proposes instead to think of power as an expression of a group's aptitude to act in a pluralistic environment and in concert, thus as power in common. The A. takes care to distinguish power as an end in itself from violence of an instrumental order which is never legitimate, and from Authority which presupposes unconditional recognition and respect, wondering in the end if all power can do without the durability factor that is the authority of a foundation<br>

Abstract: This introduction of the HSR Special Issue on "Critique and Social Change: Historical, Cultural, and Institutional Perspectives" addresses the question of how critique and social change are interrelated. Conflicts and disputes are considered to be a major source of critique. We distinguish three types of conflicts: (1) Value conflicts result from the ongoing process of rationalization and the differentiation of relatively autonomous "value spheres" (Weber) such as politics, economy, science, law, etc. (2) The growth and expansion of these value spheres, e.g. the growth of capitalism, in turn produce new forms of inequalities and leads to distributional conflicts. (3) As questions of distribution and inclusion are closely linked, critique also originates from identity conflicts, which address the social recognition of individuals and collectivities. In order to understand how critique is related to social change, we suggest that critique can be studied either as a condition for or as an effect from social change. Based on this distinction we provide an overview over the contributions of this volume.<br>

Abstract: This study among the Maneo (Seram, Indonesia) focuses on the pragmatics of kinship knowledge. Through an extended investigation of a stranger's arrival, I untangle processes of recognition from those guiding the determination of relatedness. Recognition establishes the continuity of experience; as such, verity is a measure of the adequacy as opposed to accuracy of observation: a fact that contributes to the possibility of misrecognition. By contrast, relatedness is contingent upon the expression and suppression of different, sometimes contradictory historical ties. [kinship, knowledge, pragmatism, Maneo, Indonesia]<br>

Abstract: The field of bioethics has been dominated by the tenets and assumptions of Western philosophical rationalistic thought. A principles and rights-based approach to discussions of moral dilemmas has sustained and reinforced a pervasive reductionism, utilitarianism, and ethnocentrism in the field. Recent explorations of casuistry and hermeneutics suggest a movement toward an expanded theoretical and conceptual framing of medical ethical problems. Increased attention to moral phenomenology and a recognition of the importance of social, cultural, and historical determinants that shape moral questioning should facilitate collaborative work between anthropologists and ethicists. In this article, I examine the philosophical orientation of U.S. bioethics and the relationship of the social sciences to the field of medical ethics. Deterrents to collaboration between anthropologists and bioethicists are explored. Finally, I review past and possible future contributions of anthropology to the field of bioethics and, more generally, to medical ethics.<br>

Abstract: Historical narratives help construct social identities, which are maintained through differentiation between in-groups and “others.” In this article, we contend that Fatima Besnaci-Lancou's texts, as well as her reconciliation work—in which she enjoins Beurs and Harkis' offspring to write a new, inclusive, polyphonic narrative of the Algerian War—are an example of the positive use of textually mediated identity (re)construction. Her work suggests the possibility of implementing a moderate politics of empathetic recognition of the (often migration-related) memories of “others” so as to reinforce French national belongingness.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: In the event, SPEP did seem to be made up of oddballs and outsiders in those early years. In 1964 it was a bit larger than the twenty or thirty souls that Ed Casey describes in his paper, but not by much. The leadership was a diverse bunch: Aron Gurwitsch, gruff and insistent on rigor and clarity, the embodiment of the old-school European professor. His presence made me aware, for the first time, I think, of the existence of the New School for Social Research, that amazing institution where I would later teach and am teaching now. John Wild, with the fervor of the recent convert himself, was eager to convert others. According to one tale, possibly apocryphal, an undergraduate student reported that he kept talking about a place called “Lebensville” and saying we ought to go back there. Herbert Spiegelberg, sweetest of men, had earned the respect and gratitude of all for publishing his two-volume
      The Phenomenological Movement, which had appeared in 1960. George Schrader, slowly abandoning Kant for Heidegger. Bill Earle, a very smooth talker—that's all I remember. Erwin Straus, who in his old age exemplified, every time he stood up to speak, the epic struggle of our species to attain the upright posture. Dreyfus, Todes, Lingus, Schrag, and Edie were the Young Turks in that group. We graduate students, still looking on curiously from the sidelines at that point, slowly got a sense of the great learning and intellectual integrity of our elders and also eventually picked up the excitement of being an embattled minority struggling for survival and recognition.<br>

Abstract: Although the uncanny strangeness of the unconscious may be, as Kristeva says, the “ultimate condition of our being with others” (1991, 192), this haunting togetherness is based niether on Kantian equality as like for like nor on Levinasian unrecognizable radical alterity. Rather, unconscious fears and desires produce others whom we recognize as friend or enemy, loved or hated, human or animal, virtuous or monstrous, having the right to live or deserving to be put to death. While intimately related to the hyperbolic and impossible ethical demand to open ourselves to the unrecognizable, these categorical oppositions are not simply a matter of our inability to recognize others or even the otherness of others. Rather, they are a matter of recognizing them as abject others deserving to be locked up, tortured, and killed. We cannot begin to witness to what is beyond recognition in the singularity of each life until we come to terms with the death drive in ourselves, specifically as it manifests itself in our own fears and desires through which we create both our friends and our enemies, both those who are like us and those who are not, both those who are with us and those who are against us.<br>

Abstract: I noted in the context of SPEP's beginning that “social issues” were usually separated from strictly “academic” ones. Postmodern thought in this country grew in part from the recognition that “modern” sensibility, for all its vagueness, included a type of identifiable Western white male domination that narrowed disastrously the range, perception, styles of thought, and sense of philosophical mission. Philosophers might well be concerned with conceptions of justice, freedom, human dignity, responsibility, and the social self in those early programs, but the gulf between such interest and direct social action was deep and wide. Philosophy had its own demanding and strictly patrolled life that set it apart from the everyday dimensions of existence with its tragic dominations, unquestioned codes of acceptability, and distributions of power. The volatility of emotions—especially those identified as “women's emotions”—and the hopeless messiness and relativity of people's psychological lives placed them in outlying regions of fundamental instability and beyond proper philosophical concern for most phenomenologists. The idea that truth might originate in error and senselessly perpetuate mere lack of the possibility for truth as it is traditionally and philosophically understood was not an operative part of SPEP's transformative vision for philosophy in the United States. Also missing was the sense that disciplined thought, moral values, and wisdom are founded by nothing they resemble. Few philosopher in those early years recognized that Western, white male orientations might be more of a problem that an admirable basis for recognizing and judging civilized behavior. Although SPEP's mission was to disturb the perceived complacency of North American philosophy in the “Anglo” tradition by the vigorous infusion of phenomenological and existential thought into the U.S. academy, it was also unwittingly poised for its own deep disturbance. That disturbance arose from innovative an~<br>

Abstract: The movement from
            thentonow, so far as ethics and philosophy of religion are concerned, can be largely told in relation to five proper names: Ricoeur, Levinas, Kierkegaard, Derrida, and Marion. Paul Ricoeur was already part ofthen, but as he kept writing, so broadly and so deeply, he became more and more an inescapable part of thenow. The problem is that he did this in so many different ways that he could easily take up all my time and space and then some. Not just in such collections asThinking BiblicallyandFiguring the Sacredbut whenever he wrote about virtually anything, be it time and narrative, memory, metaphor, interpretation, translation, ideology, evil, justice, the self (as other), recognition, or whatever, he provoked our thought about either ethics or religion or both. So, with gratitude and apologies, I'll leave him as the one who has shaped ournow, so far as ethics and religion are concerned, in more different but deep ways than anyone else. He is in any case more important for the first revolution than for the second.<br>

Abstract: Such vulnerability to assault raises questions of ethics that are central to the next section, entitled “Ethics and Reciprocity in Heidegger and Beauvoir.” Julie Kuhlken's article, “Heidegger and Aristotle: Action, Production, and Ethos,” considers Heidegger's practical philosophy, as expressed in his “Letter on Humanism,” in relation to his lectures on Aristotle from the 1920s. Through a discussion of Heidegger's distinctions between action and effecting and between ethics and ethos, Kuhlken argues that Heidegger's practical philosophy focuses less on ethics as it is typically understood today and more on the ancient notion of the good life. In “The Other (Woman): Limits of Knowledge in Beauvoir's Ethics of Reciprocity,” Ellie Anderson reassesses Beauvoir's ethics of reciprocity through a reading of her 1943 novel
      She Came to Stay. Anderson argues, against prominent readers of Beauvoir such as Penelope Deutscher and Debra Bergoffen, that central to Beauvoir's ethics is the recognition of the irreducible otherness or radical alterity of the other—and thus of a fundamental epistemic gap between self and other.<br>

Abstract: Discussions of health these days, in both popular and academic discourse, are increasingly turning toward the concept of sustainability. Indeed, interdisciplinary academic programs as well as institutes and foundations dedicated to “sustainability studies” have sprung up around the world, ambitiously seeking to connect global politics, economics, and environmentalism. They proceed from the assumption that the capacity to endure demands a long-range, integrated vision of social justice, economic equity, and ecological health, necessitating cooperation among individuals in the humanities, the sciences, and corporate industry. A recent essay in
      American Literary Historyentreats ecocritics to abjure the “retreat to the bower, the plough, or the graduate seminar, issuing the same familiar jeremiads against science and industrial capitalism, [in] recognition that sustainability studies in the humanities is the natural companion of sustainability science, not its antagonist.”
            While he is guilty at times of stultifying pigheadedness about science, considering the ecological grounding of his wide-view epidemiology, Shaw certainly thought in these epic terms and sought solutions to those very challenges. From27
         Major BarbaratoFarfetched Fables, Shaw displays his attentiveness to a program of health in which scientists, industrialists, political leaders, and scholars commit to (repurposing Andrew Undershaft's line) “looking after the drainage.”<br>

Abstract: Indeed, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health reports that individuals with hope deficits experience a range of enervating feelings that include helplessness, guilt, and despair; and in extreme cases, says the institute, the hopeless may succumb to depression and suicide.
         
               Similarly, the American Psychological Association links hopelessness with helplessness, self-blame and, most notably, depression.7
            
               “People who are depressed,” the association observes, “may become overwhelmed and exhausted and stop participating in certain everyday activities altogether. They may withdraw from family and friends. Some depressed individuals may have thoughts of death or suicide.”8
            
               Clinically speaking, the hopeless are mired in distress, immiserated. They cannot lead fulfilling lives, let alone thrive. In acute circumstances, they may even choose not to live at all. Clearly, when hopelessness metastasizes into depression, it becomes a life-threatening disease. Hence, without the therapeutic restoration of hope, the forlorn remain in grave danger of frantically treading water for a while and then, with no lifeline in sight, eventually drowning from sheer debilitation in a sea of isolation and anguish. Hope, then, is undeniably critical to wellness, and, in my judgment, hope is precisely the quality that best accounts for the buoyancy Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur demonstrated throughout their long and productive lives—lives that included frustration, disappointment, and adversity along with success, satisfaction, and recognition.9<br>
