  Abstract: For the past twenty years, musicology has increasingly merged the study of Western “classical” music with cultural history on one hand and critical-philosophical thought on the other. This development is no longer news, but it is still noteworthy. The field has expanded to take in a wide variety of topics and methods formerly considered peripheral or illegitimate. It has rescinded the exemption from social utility formerly used to separate classical music from popular music and culture, and it has broken both with the nineteenth-century metaphysics of music as a vessel of transcendence and the twentieth century’s reduction of that metaphysics<br>

  Abstract: Few things seem as natural as the multiplicity of vernacular languages used for making sense of life through texts—that is, for making literature. And few things seem as unnatural as their gradual disappearance in the present, especially from the pressures exerted by globalizing English. Literary-language loss is in fact often viewed as part of a more general reduction of diversity in a cultural ecosystem, a loss considered as dangerous as the reduction of biological diversity, to which—in another instance of cultural naturalization—it is often compared. Today’s homogenization of culture, of which language loss is one aspect, seems<br>

  Author(s) O’Donohue John<br>
  Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion’s philosophical project is largely about being true to phenomenology’s supreme principle—the principle that every originary intuition is a legitimizing source of cognition, that everything originarily offered in intuition be accepted as it presents itself.¹ It is by interrogating this “principle of principles,” by unfolding its full consequences, that Marion can posit his “third reduction”—beyond both Husserl and Heidegger—and so unveil the primacy of sheer givenness. In doing so, Marion would claim, any autarchic subjectivity (whether transcendental or existential) is dethroned and dismantled in one and the same act that givenness (
                  donation) is “set free”: accepting<br>

  Abstract: In a series of astute papers over the last fifteen years, Steven Vogel has developed a remarkably compelling social constructivist critique of “nature.” Having drawn on several well-known and widely accepted postmodern worries, he might have appeared vulnerable to the traditional environmentalist’s equally well-known counterthrust: doesn’t the reduction of nature to culture simply efface nature in one last, hubristic and utterly anthropocentric gesture? Yet Vogel’s argument is carefully constructed, the fruit of a thoughtful and sober mind. He carefully avoids the overstatement to which some have been prone. Notwithstanding many excellent arguments, however, Vogel appears not to have carried the<br>

  Author(s) Manolopoulos Mark<br>
  Abstract: Divinity and alterity have haunted phenomenology since its beginnings. At phenomenology’s margins Rudolf Otto described God as the “wholly other.”¹ This otherness of God and the divinity of otherness came into sharp relief in Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology, where God’s transcendence is bracketed as much as the alterity of the other in the reduction of intentional consciousness.² This is a move replicated in Heidegger’s “reduction,” to use the vocabulary of Marion which is employed in this volume by Kearney and Manoussakis, where the question of God depends on the analytic of

This translation of Gegebenheit withdonationand givenness is not uncontroversial, and Marion has been challenged on this.¹ The<br>

  Abstract: As Parts I and II have demonstrated, Nancy conceives Christianity—or more generally, monotheism—as a religion that is marked from the outset by a secular structure. This secular structure consists not in the proposition of a unique God but in the way this God is present in the world. What is most important in the shift from polytheism to monotheism is thus not a reduction in the number of gods but a rearticulation of the relation between God and the world. Whereas polytheism affirms the immediate presence of gods and believes them to inhabit and organize the world, monotheism<br>

Unfortunately, data about analyses adequate for research purposes are difficult to obtain, and much of the data that are available have been so transformed in the process of reduction that investigators cannot be sure of their meaning.

  Abstract: Given the long-term participation by the Historians of Religion in the meetings inspired by Carl Jung, it seems virtually unavoidable that any study of their theories of religion must carefully assess their respective positions in relation to psychology. This, however, is a particularly vexatious area of research, inasmuch as each explicitly opposed the reduction of religious realities to psychological forces. On the other hand, each scholar, at the same time, was accustomed to employing psychological categories—of which archetypes are only the best known—to interpret religious materials.¹<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we analyze the general epistemological conditions for knowability and explicability of the universe as a whole. Both knowability and explicability imply an anthropological dimension in cosmology, for both these requirements have human origin: to speculate about the universe one must experience its presence through the instantaneous synthesis associated with conscious life. It is argued that the cosmological principle acts as reduction of this synthesis to a mental spatial uniformity of the universe. However, the contingent facticity of the cosmological principle leads to the necessity of its explication in terms of generative steps required to grasp the sense<br>

This challenge, perhaps most notably in the work of the French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty, does not consist in the reduction of one of the opposed terms to the other in the manner of a thoroughgoing or ‘eliminative’ materialism but rather rests on a broader critique of both terms.

Issue: ci.2002.28.issue-4<br>
Date: 06 2002<br>
Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: A second lesson might be called inspirational. The idea of resurrection participated in the political functions of hell.
         136Whether it is best considered, with Freud, as a symptom of a universal neurosis or, with Jankélévitch, as a form of the “hopeless optative,” it has played, for those who believe in it, an important existential role.137But political and psychological functions do not exhaust its historical meaning. Two millennia after its initial formulation, the Christian doctrine of the resurrection has a potential to question and to move that is more powerful and profound than considerations of wandering little fingers or hypothetical brain transplants. Resurrection discourses differ fundamentally from philosophical thought experiments.138Indeed, they were not seen as concerning fantastical situations from which apparently relevant conclusions could be extracted but as meaningful matters of momentous real consequences. One of them was the certainty that bodies are essential to humanity and that a disembodied self does not rank as a human being. Thus, while the neuropsychological eschatologies science and philosophy produced since the seventeenth century moved us away from the Middle Ages, our era’s questions and dilemmas about self and body take us back. In its own way, the Christian romance of the resurrection, with its assertion of the ontologically crucial place of body for identity and of community for human existence, may still be an inspiring story for those who, against the neurological reduction of self, would rather live with body, desire, history, and the other than inhabit the solitude of isolated brains.<br>

Abstract: When incorporating a tool, one’s concurrent incorporation by it may have a series of unanticipated results. As Ihde notes, every instrument imposes an “amplification‐reduction” structure on one’s natural capacities. The telephone, while allowing communication through its amplification of voice, in other ways yields a reduced encounter devoid of direct sight and touch. As a result of such transformations, each technology provides a “telic inclination” toward certain modified modes of interaction. [

Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: Another example of objectification occurs when I am defined as an object reduced to the parameters seen by economic theory—when I become the famous “economic agent,” supposedly summed up by the calculation of my needs, by the evaluation of these needs in numbered costs and the balancing of these costs against purchasing power, and finally by the purported rational calculation of a correspondence between the costs of the objects of the needs and this purchasing power. In order to attain even an approximation of rigor, this stage‐by‐stage reduction assumes that choices are made according to the laws of exchange and thus that the economic agent proceeds strictly according to self‐interest, in short, that I only know and practice business, which is to say strict exchange according to the iron law of a selfishness that is no longer moral, but epistemological. Thus there disappears from economic analysis everything that escapes exchange and commerce, but which doubtless makes them possible and flows over them in every direction: the gift and all the forms of social gratuity that have not yet been rendered economic. For if economy economizes on the gift, then more fundamentally, gratuity economizes on economy itself.

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: After this historical, critical section, Robbins develops a more constructive approach toward a philosophical theology that capitalizes on the ontotheological condition. He claims as his models Paul Ricoeur and, ultimately, Jean‐Luc Marion and Emmanuel Lévinas. Understanding Ricoeur’s hermeneutics “according to the model of religious orthodoxy in which faith and practice translate into knowledge” (p. 123), Robbins praises Ricoeur for offering a model of philosophical theology but criticizes this model because, like all orthodoxy, the philosophy remains uncritical of its foundations—that is, of the religion to which it gives conceptual formulation. Another model of philosophical theology is provided by Marion and Lévinas. In Marion, Robbins asserts, phenomenology and theology each pass into the other in such a way that there is not a confusion or reduction but a mutual criticism and modification of each by the other (p. 113). Marion’s supposed embrace of the ontotheological dialogue between philosophy and theology is foreshadowed, according to Robbins, in Lévinas, who first modeled “an alternative strategy for contemporary philosophical and theological thought … a strategy that is
      otherwise than overcoming” (p. 132).<br>

Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: If we return to Ricoeur for a moment, Frei’s emphasis on how the “Christlike pattern” of the literal sense attends to contingency and eventuality may answer some of Ricoeur’s concerns regarding the privilege of narrative in Christian interpretation. For, as Ricoeur describes, the “Christian pattern” of narrative tends to highlight continuity and function as a form of consolation that freezes the polyphony of discourse: “The question, then, is whether the so‐called biblical narrative is not a culturally motivated reduction of the rich interplay of temporal qualities that are displayed by the different literary genres encompassed in the canonical scriptures.”
         28In light of the above comments, and given the further discussions of Midrash that follow below, then one can see that Frei envisages the literal sense of narrative as providing an alternative to the “Christian pattern” that troubles Ricoeur. At its best—perhaps, when practiced with real obedience—the literal sense envisages a scriptural world that is attentive to the temporality and historicity of singularity.<br>

Abstract: The Gen. 1:27 myth can be said in part to represent, from this angle, a narrative of the human narrative capability: a narrative of a capability that lies at the very origins or limits of human narration as such. This capability is here represented by humankind being affirmed as an image of a Creator who creates, precisely, by narrating. That is, the Creator is affirmed to have made the world by speech (“And God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light”; “Then God said, ‘Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness'”) and over a period of time (seven days). Genesis 1 is a story of the world as created by story. As the image of such a Creator, humankind is placed in touch with narration’s ultimate mystery: the impossibility, finally, of narrating our capacity for narration itself. Such can only be mythologized as an image of something invisible and divine: a peculiar form of narration that resists reduction to anything that could ever be understood from actual history. From this angle, human ethical narration is affirmed as an imitation of divine narration. It consists in a primordial capability for simultaneously ahistorical (or free) and historical intentionality over time.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Neuroscience explains in sum individual volition, a mental function or faculty that was traditionally attributed to the transcendental soul, by reduction, that is, in terms of neuronal structures of genetic or epigenetic derivation. Yet, the neuroactivity of these structures is not propositional; that is, it is not lived through affectively in the first person, nor does it display itself in narrative terms; it can only be mapped propositionally from a third‐person perspective. As an example of this sort of descriptive mapping—applied to the simpler process of perception, though, not to volition—Gerald Edelman formulates propositionally a cat’s perceptual map with the following sentence: “Cerebellum and basal ganglia active in pattern [q], premotor and motor regions active in pattern [r], and subcorticalities in visual maps active in patterns x, y, and z.” The specific terminology adopted in this paratactic, third‐person description is irrelevant to our discussion, of course. (But for the sake of correct representation, it is important to emphasize the inclusiveness of the term “pattern,” repeated several times: it is a recent discovery of neuroscience that an external stimulus may pattern the same perceptual output in an individual brain [and
         a maggior ragionein distinct brains] even when it triggers the interaction of different neurons and neuronal groups. In this regard, Edelman defines the termdegeneracyas “the ability of structurally different elements of [the brain] to perform the same function or yield the same output.”)7Relevant to our discussion is the idea that the propositional mapping of a human being’s decision making would have to recur to an analogous, third‐person parataxis and catalogue of patterns, as those adopted in the cat example (admittedly enriched to a degree of inclusiveness—of neuronal clusters pertinent to perception, memory, attention, intention, prediction, mood, etc.—far beyond the threshold of current neurological knowledge).<br>

Abstract: However, a revision is needed for our global times. It is not life qua life that is the norm, the good, for responsible existence. That conception would merely replace one centrism for another: biocentrism for anthropocentrism or theocentrism. It is, rather, the integration of many dimensions of life, the integrity of life, which must orient individuals and social action in our global times. This idea—the integrity of life—is a complex one. Within the work of theological ethics it enables critical reflection across an array of domains of existence and the goods proposed or entailed. It also provides orientation for responsible action. That is to say, the idea of the “integrity of life” articulates a multidimensional conception of the good but also a norm or measure for responsible actions and relations.
         39Responsible existence is a life of integrity formed, personally and socially, through an enduring dedication to the integrity of life. The integrity of life provides the norms for humanizing religion in the full sense of the idea. It moves beyond a merely humanistic or theistic conceptuality or even the deconstruction of that dyad in order to articulate a good that resonates with religious and moral depths in the remembrance of death and the love of life. Keeping our attention on humanizing religion is thus meant to save us from a reduction in a conception of the moral good, to insist on the complexity of goodness. From diverse strands of our cultural legacy—Hellenistic, biblical, modern—there arise the resources to render productive, rather than destructive, the tension between the limit of death and the love of life, a sense of responsibility and the proper object of responsible action, the integrity of life.<br>

Abstract: One cannot deny that Dante adopts the philosophical tradition that asserts human superiority over animals because of the rational intellect and the possession of free will (
         Paradiso5.19–25).35Aristotle'sNicomachean Ethicsdivides the qualities of character to be avoided into three kinds: vice, moral weakness, and brutishness. Explaining brutishness as the reduction of the human to a beast, Aristotle argues that the opposite to brutishness is “superhuman virtue, a kind of heroic and divine excellence.”36Thus, Aristotle posits a continuous line for humans going from brutishness (most like animals) to superhuman (most like gods). In Dante's time, the Dominicans continued this Aristotelian tradition, with Albertus Magnus providing what has been characterized as a theory of zoological anthropocentrism.37Animals' ability to participate in “man's rational way of living” allows Albert to rank animals according to the degree of their resemblance to man, but man, made in the image of God, is the perfect and most dignified creature. However, Albert does not conclude with this simple hierarchy of beings, for in introducing the Aristotelian idea that something marvelous (mirabile) resides in all natural things, he links all natural things as continuous with one another rather than in a binary opposition as man versus nature, animal versus human, and so on.38<br>

Abstract: Gaston Berger, le fondateur des Études philosophiques (1926), a joué un rôle décisif dans l'introduction intellectuelle, mais aussi matérielle et institutionnelle, de la phénoménologie de Husserl en France. À partir de documents inédits et d'une lecture, dès lors renouvelée, de la thèse sur Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, cette étude montre l'originalité de l'interprétation que donne Berger de la phénoménologie husserlienne, ainsi que les réserves qu'il formule à l'égard de certains thèmes: le moi absolu, la tension entre l'intention et l'intuition, sans oublier la réappropriation de la réduction phénoménologique sous le mode d'un détachement. En ce sens, il apparaît, d'une part, que Berger est un représentant typique de la première génération française des « disciples » de Husserl et que, d'autre part, la réception qu'il en fait est déjà révélatrice de problématiques propres à certains phénoménologues contemporains. Gaston Berger, the founder of Études philosophiques (1926), played a decisive role in the intellectual and also material and institutional introduction of Husserl's phenomenology into France. Based on unpublished documents permitting a new reading of his thesis Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, this study shows the originality of Berger's interpretation of Husserlian phenomenology, as well as the reservations he developed with regard to certain themes: the absolute ego, the tension between intention and intuition, not to mention the reappropriation of the phenomenological reduction by means of a detachment. In this sense, it appears, on the one hand, that Berger is a typical representative of the first French generation of « disciples » of Husserl and, on the other hand, that the reception he offered is itself revealing as to the problematics of certain contemporary phenomenologists.<br>

Abstract: The works of Tiryakian, Bruyn and Douglas are examined as representative of "phenomenological sociology." Radical problems are discovered in their use of key concepts in phenomenology: intention, reduction, phenomenon and essence. These problems are shown to arise out of a failure to grasp the nature of the phenomenological enterprise and its relationship to sociology. Turning back to the original formulation of this relationship by Husserl, we discover problems of transcendental intersubjectivity, of type and essence, and of objectivism. We then point out the existence of sociologies which do not share the shortcomings of what is called phenomenological sociology, yet which make use of the perspective and approach of phenomenology. We then focus on one of these sociologies, ethnomethodology in its relation to phenomenology. We find parallels in their methodology and domains of inquiry, and divergency in their approaches to intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: This essay outlines an account of 'theological humanism' as a new form of theology of culture. I trace the connection between theological humanism and an ethics of responsibility dedicated to respecting and enhancing the integrity of life. I argue that without a 'theological' humanism we risk the reduction of values to human purposes, and yet without a theological 'humanism' religious conviction is unconstrained by moral purpose. In our age of religious violence and ecological crisis, what is needed in ethics is a renewed vision of the moral vocation of human beings not against but within the wider compass of life on earth.<br>

Abstract: The proponent of the repeal measure, Leonardo Emo, asserted that the dowry limitation law
had produced 'diminutione honoris et libertatis huius civitatis' ('a reduction of the honour and
liberty of this city') because all Venetians were now 'de sua libertate privatos' ('deprived of their
freedom'). He urged repeal in order that 'omnes cives et fideles nostri' ('all citizens and loyal
subjects') might be restored to 'sua solita libertate in facta nuptiarum et dotium' ('their customary
freedom in matters regarding marriage and dowries'). ASV, Senato, 'Misti', Reg. 53, fol. 94v (30
December 1420). The repeal attempt was defeated by 73 nay votes against 45 yeas, with 8 absten-
sions. The act threatening a fine of 1000 ducats for proponents or supportors of further repeal efforts
was passed immediately after the defeat of the repeal proposal.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the crisis of narrative in contemporary culture. It begins by examining the challenge represented by the mass media for the continuing art of storytelling. Taking up Walter Benjamin's warning that we are moving from an age of narrative experience to an age of instant information, it analyses the implications of the post-modern 'cult of simulation' for education, historiography and ethics. The paper concludes by advocating a critical hermeneutic approach as the most apt response to this contemporary dilemma. Only by means of such hermeneutic retrieval, inspired by the work of Ricoeur and Gadamer, can we avoid the current reduction of temporal experience to a 'depthless present' without past or future, thereby reaffirming the crucial narrative dimensions of historical memory and hope.<br>

Abstract: This is an elaboration of an idea underlying Dooyeweerd's entire theory of individuality
structures, i.e. the idea that many sciences, including biology and psychology, invariably tend
to absolutize their function concept. The modal (functional) perspective is time and again
exchanged for an (ontic) perspective in terms of entities, Dooyeweerd says. Functions are seen
as quasi-entities having a life of their own. The inevitable consequence is that the coherence of
functions becomes a problem. This ultimately results in either dualism (two functions made
independent and placed over against each other) or some kind of monism (reduction of
functions to just one).<br>

Abstract: Literature discussing rhetoric is mainly concerned with rhetoric per se - its structure, and the categorization of arguments by kind. Rarely do rhetorical studies examine the actual effects on audiences, and auditors' reactions. On the other hand, sociological studies of scientific controversies look at rhetoric - or argumentation - in action, but with few references to rhetorical studies. The purpose of this paper is to integrate rhetorical studies into the sociology of technology in order to integrate the concept of action into discourse analysis. I intend to show how the use of discourse to enroll actors in a health technology is intimately linked to action. I deconstruct the promoters' strategy into two discursive components - the utility component and the fear-reduction component - to show how the rhetoric of expectations (utility) and representations (fear) contingently shape the fate of a technology.<br>

Abstract: This article looks at HIV prevention projects in which established stigmatized and stigmatizing roles were actively reversed and manipulated in pursuit of HIV harm reduction. In two Norwegian projects, sex workers and drug users carried out harm-reduction activities with other drug users and sex workers. Although HIV-related harm reduction was the aim of the projects, termination or reduction of drug use or sex work was not. Such changes nevertheless occurred among the sex workers and drug users who took active part in the project. The article considers these changes in order to reflect on the meanings and roles of participation in HIV prevention work. In particular, the discussion theorizes on possible ways in which alteration of roles and subject positions may produce self-reflective effects with transformative potentials.<br>

Abstract: Assessing the limits of evolutionary and cognitive approaches to the study of culture goes to the heart of an issue that tends to divide humanists and scientists. The issue is how far, in dealing with complex cultural texts and the complex transactions we perform as readers, can we advance by scientific reduction? The issue is vexed by the fact that at times the complexity and novelty of humanistic discourse is little more than obfuscation and strained ingenuity. But such failings discredit neither the search for novelty, nor the earned perception of irreducible complexity, nor the immense importance of work that is necessarily, and terminally, speculative.<br>

Abstract: Shaftesbury's deism, widely representative of eighteenth-century liberal theology, may be profitably viewed as a reaction against Puritanism in particular and Pauline theology in general. Seen from this perspective, it implies, without explicitly asserting, a reduction of moral standards from the infinite conception of moral law characteristic of Protestantism. Shaftesbury showed no appreciation of the need for redemption or forgiveness, and changed the emphasis in religion from devotion to God above all else to a purely anthropocentric morality which God merely supported. But, in spite of the crudity of his theology and the dubious implications of his ethics, Shaftesbury sought to combat some of the harmful psychological effects to which Paulinism might lead when received in the wrong spirit, and manifested genuine religious insight in this effort.<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Abstract: Este artigo reflecte sobre o significado critico dos conceitos de tradição e preconceito, noções fundamentias da filosofia hermeneutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer. Visa de forma particular a contestação que o autor faz da moderna redução do sentido da filosofia. Filosofia ou teoria da ciência, eis os termos de uma questão que atravessa o pensamento de Gadamer, desde Verdade e Método, até aos últimos textos. Para o filosofo, na raiz originária do sentido está um modo ôntico de ser, caracterizado pela memória, pelo efeito histórico da tradição e pela necessidade de formação. A razão, que se sabe hoje historica e finita, parte sempre de pressupostos, que marcam a sua basilar inserção na comunidade da palavra já sempre partilhada e nos lembram como é ilusório o sonho iluminista de uma transparência total. /// This article is a reflexion about the critical meaning of the concept of tradition and prejudice in the hermeneutical philosopphy of H.-G. Gadamer. It focuses on Gadamer's protest against the modern reduction of the meaning of philosophy. Philosophy or theory of science are the terms of the question that crosses all of Gadamer's thought, from Wahrheit und Methode until the later works. At the root of meaning is for Gadamer an ontological way of being characterized by memory, the historic effect of tradition and the need of formation. Reason, which we now know as historical and finite, is grounded on presuposed ideas which mark its fundamental insertion in the comunity of the world, already shared, and remind us of how deceptive the iluminist dream of a total transparency actually is.<br>

Abstract: La ciudad habla a sus habitantes. En este artículo se presenta a la ciudad como texto, susceptible de distintas lecturas. Este nivel significativo orienta los comportamientos urbanos, da cuenta de su trama social y contiene las huellas de las decisiones históricas que incidieron en su construcción. En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Abstract: À partir d'un petit corpus de controverses advenues récemment en France à propos de fictions littéraires ou cinématographiques, mettant l'accent sur les fortes restrictions encadrant actuellement la censure, cet article — inscrit dans la perspective d'une sociologie des valeurs dont sont tout d'abord explicitées les règles énonciatives — se propose : premièrement, de comprendre les principes qui poussent les acteurs à limiter l'espace imparti à la fiction ; deuxièmement, d'examiner la façon dont la narratologie a traité cette question des limites, les principes qui s'en dégagent et les instruments qui méritent d'être retenus ; troisièmement, de réfléchir aux raisons pour lesquelles il peut être nécessaire de limiter soit axiologiquement, soit ontologiquement, la fiction; et quatrièmement, d'expliquer pourquoi les chercheurs ont intérêt à en élargir les limites, de manière à éviter plusieurs types de réductions - logiciste, esthète, herméneutique, scientiste. L'article se termine par une tentative de solution aux controverses précitées, en forme d'avis d'expert outillé par cette analyse des limites de la fiction. Using a small corpus of recent controversies in France about fiction in literature or the cinema that have emphasized the tight restrictions now on censorship, this approach in terms of a sociology of values starts by examining the rules governing speech acts about this topic. First of all, how to understand the principles that lead to limiting the room allowed for fiction ? Secondly, how has narratology dealt with this question of limits ? What principles can be identified, and what instruments are worth using? Thirdly, what reasons might make it necessary to limit fiction either axiologically or ontologically ? Finally, the attempt is made to explain why researchers have an interest in broadening these limits so as to avoid several types (logical, aesthetic, hermeneutic, scientific) of « reduction ». The attempt is made to provide a solution to the aforeme~<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical philosophy as developed by Heidegger and Gadamer is not compatible with the classical phenomenological programme elaborated by Husserl. The hermeneutical stress on historicity as a necessary condition for understanding is unfamiliar to Husserl's strictly theoretical approach. However, this does not mean that a hermeneutical philosophy as such cannot be conceived in a phenomenological sense. Whether or not hermeneutical philosophy is phenomenological depends on the paradigm chosen for hermeneutical explanation. A hermeneutics referring to the interpretation of texts may elucidate constitutional elements of phenomenology, e.g. phenomenological reduction and reflection. In this way it even can initiate a modification of phenomenology which, instead of being caught up in its subjective foundation, now appears as elucidating the openness of the correlation between intentional attitudes and their 'objects'. For this correlation the interpretation is a paradigm, whereas the openness of the correlation can be explained in respect of freedom, language, and time.<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Abstract: El interés por la búsqueda de soluciones a los déficits de legitimación del proyecto europeo ha provocado en las ciencias sociales y en la historia un enorme interés por el estudio de la idea de espacio público. Éste ha sido resultado del vínculo establecido por sectores intelectuales cercanos al europeísmo entre el desarrollo de un espacio público europeo con la reducción de la distancia existente entre las políticas públicas, las instituciones y la ciudadanía europea. Desde la perspectiva del historiador, sin embargo, el estudio del espacio público europeo no puede tener como único objetivo apoyar la creación de una identidad colectiva supranacional a partir de la construcción de un «relato europeo», destinado a restituir la ficción de una comunidad histórica de pertenencia, ni tampoco arrogarse la misión de fijar histórica y culturalmente las fronteras de Europa. La utilidad social de su estudio reside en la misma ambición de contribuir a la creación de ese espacio público europeo a partir de la promoción de valores que se asocian con Europa, como la libertad, la tolerancia y la democracia, sin renunciar por ello ni al imprescindible ejercicio de crítica ni al análisis riguroso de nuestro pasado inmediato. The interest in the search for solutions to the lacks of standing in the European project has caused a huge interest in the study of the idea of public sphere in all the Social Sciences disciplines, also in the History. An interest that is a result of to have been linked the development of a European public sphere with a reduction in the distance between public policy, institutions and European citizenship in intellectual groups close to Europeanism. However, from the historian s perspective, the study of the European public sphere can not have the sole aim to support the creation of a supranational collective identity from the construction of a «European story» designed to restore the fiction about a historic community of membership, as well as not to assume t~<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113412<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Stampfl Barry<br>
Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: Quand Suarez aborde la question du sens du mot droit il se réclame de saint Thomas et du droit romain ; en fait l'usage des références et des citations masque un détournement : la réduction, au droit subjectif et à la loi, de l'ancien souci d'attribuer à chacun ce qui lui revient. When Suarez approaches the meaning of the word jus, he refers to Thomas Aquinas and to Roman Law ; in fact his use of references and quotations hides an embezzlement : the reduction of the old care « suum cuique tribuendi » to subjective right and to lex.<br>

Abstract: « Le moment topologique » désigne la référence commune à la topologie faite par de nombreux auteurs dans les années soixante (Merleau-Ponty, Lacan, Deleuze, Foucault, Derrida). Dans le paradigme phénoménologique, il conditionna deux réponses antonymes: d'un côté, chez Merleau-Ponty, il ouvrit la voie vers une nouvelle réduction, d'un autre côté, chez Derrida, il permit une rupture d'avec le cadre méthodologique de la phénoménologie. C'est pourtant le dépassement de cette opposition qui est ici proposé. « The topological moment » denotes the common reference to topology developed by numerous authors during the 1960's (Merleau-Ponty, Lacan, Deleuze, Foucault, Derrida). In the phenomenological paradigm, it created two antonymous responses: on one side, Merleau-Ponty paved the way for a new reduction, on the other side, Derrida facilitated a break from the methodical framework of phenomenology. However, this article proposes to move beyond this opposition.<br>

Abstract: Inquiry in the social sciences is based on theoretical assumptions that are not always clearly articulated in research reports. This article surveys some of the theoretical positions that underlie various qualitative research methods and discusses some of the methodological issues raised by those positions. The four themes that serve as anchor points for the discussion are contextualization, an approach to social-scientific observation that takes into account the environment in which the observational event takes place; understanding, an approach to the problem of knowledge and explanation that addresses the range of what can be learned from observation; pluralism, the proposition that not only social settings but the methods for explaining them resist reduction to a single model; and expression, the problem of conveying the results of research.<br>

Issue: i404682<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Molyneux John M.<br>
Abstract: For most of its modern history library and information science has been governed by the mode of thinking best characterized as positivism. This epistemology, shared with most of the social sciences for some time, features the quest for universal laws and the reduction of all phenomena, including behavioral, cognitive, and so on, to the physical, among other elements. This means to knowledge is unworkable for this field; a proposed replacement for it is hermeneutical phenomenology. This article outlines the elements of a revised epistemological approach that seeks an understanding of the essences of things (such as the library) and that takes into account, among other things, the intentional stances of the human actors within the realm of library and information science. Such a re-formed epistemology allows for a different set of questions asked and a different approach to answering them.<br>

Publisher: Sameeksha Trust<br>
Issue: i397690<br>
Date: 3 21, 1976<br>
Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: At the beginning of this decade, newspapers the world over reported the UN general assembly's declaration of the last segment of the 20th century as the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), beginning January 1, 1990. There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.<br>

Abstract: L'homme déchiffre l'énigme de sa sexualité dans des cadres herméneutiques qui la qualifient ou à la disqualifient. La domination du cadre technoscientifique sert aujourd'hui à qualifier la sexualité dans les mots de l'efficacité (la performance), de la réduction biomédicale (précaution et contagion) et de l'évaluation légale et judiciaire (la déviance). Face à ce premier cadre, peut-on faire valoir ce qui, dans notre culture, initie et invente une interprétation plus riche et plus complexe, susceptible de raconter et de se représenter la sexualité Ne néglige-t-on pas souvent l'importance d'une poétique et d'une herméneutique des images servant une augmentation iconique de la sexualité ? Humans decipher the enigma of their sexuality in hermeneutical frameworks that qualify or disqualify it. The dominance of the techno-scientific framework serves today to qualify sexuality in words of efficiency (performance), bio-medical reduction (precaution and contagion) and legal and juridical evaluation (deviance). In the face of this first framework, can we give value to what, in our culture, initiates and invents a richer and more complex interpretation, susceptible to the telling and representing ofsexuality? Do we not often neglect the importance of the poetical and hermeneutical of images serving an iconic augmentation of sexuality?<br>

Abstract: Dans l'Essai sur le mal, Jean Nabert, poursuivant une démarche déjà engagée dans les Éléments pour une éthique, affronte la question de la possibilité d'une justification de l'existence humaine, L'A. propose une analyse des grandes étapes de cet essai Dans le ch. 1, il décrit les diverses figures d'un mal excédant le champ défini par les normes de la moralité, et recherche les conditions de possibilité d'une telle expérience. Dans les ch. 2 à 4, il poursuit l'analyse de l'expérience d'un mal intérieur au vouloir propre et que dissimule la réduction de celui-ci à la transgression des normes d'un sujet autonome, et il examine la compréhension de soi du sujet de l'expérience impliquée dans cette dimension du mal. Dans le dernier chapitre, il pose la question des limites de ce que permet d'espérer une « approche de la justification » par un moi tel qu'il s'est d'abord compris par réflexion sur ces données fondamentales de son expérience; au sommet de cette approche, il aborde la question de la possibilité du pardon. Pursuing along the same lines as in his Éléments pour une éthique, Jean Nabert, in his Essai sur le mal, tackles the question of the possibility of justifying human existence. The author proposes to analyze the major stages in this essay. In chapter 1, he describes diverse representations of evil that exceed the boundaries as defined by the norms of morality, and researches the conditions in which such experiences are possible. In chapters 2 to 4, he continues the analysis of evil intrinsic to will itself, which is obscured by the reduction of this evil to the transgression of an autonomous subject's limits, and examines the subject's comprehension of self when implicated in this dimension of evil. In the last chapter, the question is asked of the limitations of that which an « approach to justification » may permit to be hoped for by a self such as first understood upon reflexion of the fundamental data of his experience; at the apex of this approach, he ad~<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The most important modifications, however, that Merleau-Ponty tried to develop in his final lecturing and writing were to recast the character of “the transcendental of origins” by retooling phenomenology to become a radically
            nondichotomousdescriptive analysis ofla natureandl'esprit—nature and spirit/mind. Moreover, Merleau-Ponty was trying to fashion a nondichotomous investigative thrust for virtually all the tradition divisions in philosophy's conceptual toolbox, such as “existence” and “essence,” “sensation and intellection,” “necessity” and “contingency.” And this meant that in principle aflexibly dialectical integrative spectrumof lexical terms had to be developed to express the philosophic articulation he was trying to establish. Yet throughout it all Merleau-Ponty's guiding principle remaineddie Sachen selbst, precisely to the extent that careful phenomenological practice in epochē- and reduction-governance is in force. These remarks, however, are hardly adequate to characterize what Merleau-Ponty was doing in his last writings, but they shall have to do.<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: For Levinas, the liberation of God from Being was the definition of “ethics,” which Levinas himself called “metaphysics.” Levinas meant that ethics alone breaks the crust of Being, which he called the sphere of the “same.” The ethical other breaches what we comprehend and pre-have in advance and exposes us to the “wholly other,” by which he meant not God but the “face” of the neighbor or the stranger, which is the “trace” that God leaves behind in withdrawing from the world (Being). Levinas radicalizes the ethics of neighborly love and hospitality in the Jewish Scriptures, by means of which he thought “first philosophy” could be revitalized and ethics returned to center stage in Continental thinking, a project in which he broadly succeeded. Marion's trope, “without Being,” is structurally similar to Levinas's, but Marion really does mean God (the God of the mystical theology of the Christian neo-Platonists), whom he approaches in an ingenious series of three “reductions” in the Husserlian sense: first of transcendental subjectivity (Kant and Husserl), then of existential agency (Dasein), and finally of Being itself. The upshot of reduction is to release the givenness (
            Gegebenheit) of what he calls the “saturated phenomenon.” By this he means the phenomenon untethered from prior limiting conditions, which is free to be given in a flood ofdonationthat overwhelms the conceptual resources of the one to whom it is given (theadonné). Reversing orthodox Husserlianism, the givenness of the saturated phenomenon exceeds the intentional act.<br>

Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: In
      Phenomenology “Wide Open,”Janicaud gets his starting point by noting two competing tendencies within Husserlian phenomenology: first, there is Husserl's “metaphysical” effort to establish phenomenology as a first philosophy; second, there are his patient descriptions leading to the development of various regional ontologies. The former tendency—or what might be called a maximal phenomenology—is the one that inspires the proponents of the theological turn who regard phenomenology as the only conceivable path for metaphysics today. Janicaud, by contrast, develops his notion of a minimal phenomenology in line with the other tendency in Husserl's work. This marks a twofold shift of approach. Terminologically, it means eschewing the pretenses to reach the absolute, to be scientific, and to become a foundation of the new metaphysics. A minimal phenomenology speaks more modestly in terms of testing hypotheses within a larger project, seeking out the morphology of a set of appearances, or dealing with something in its uniqueness. Methodologically, minimal phenomenology follows the lead of Merleau-Ponty and goes directly to the phenomena without a detour through the phenomenological reduction, which is part and parcel of phenomenology's foundational impulses.<br>
