  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: Virtually every aspect of society—from spam to broken relationships—has been curated in the museum field, and such is the case with mourning and death, albeit few and far between. Just a few thematic institutions exist, like the Museum of Mourning Art at the Arlington Cemetery (no reference to animals, as far as my research indicates) and the Museum of Death in Hollywood, California. The latter has a small gallery dedicated to taxidermy and jarred animal bodies, and the owners’ own potbellied pig, now stuffed, greets visitors as they enter the theater.<br>

Sophocles wrote the plays across the span of his career andAntigone, whose dramatic action comes late in the chronology of Oedipus’s family, was likely written and performed a decade beforeOedipus the Kingand over three decades beforeOedipus at Colonus.¹ As a consequence, the plays that comprise the Theban cycle are most often understood to share a familial narrative drawn from myths rather than a single artistic frame of reference.

  Book Title: Memory Work-Anne Truitt and Sculpture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): de Baca Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Memory Workdemonstrates the evolution of the pioneering minimalist sculptor Anne Truitt. An artist determined to make her way through a new aesthetic in the 1960s, Truitt was tireless in her pursuit of a strong cultural voice. At the heart of her practice was the key theme of memory, which enabled her not only to express personal experience but also to address how perception was changing for a contemporary viewership. She gravitated toward the idea that an object in one's focus could unleash a powerful return to the past through memory, which in turn brings a fresh, even critical, attention to the present moment. In addition to the artist's own popular published writings, which detail the unique challenges facing female artists,Memory Workdraws on unpublished manuscripts, private recordings, and never-before-seen working drawings to validate Truitt's original ideas about the link between perception and mnemonic reference in contemporary art. De Baca offers an insider's view of the artist's unstinting efforts to realize her artistic vision, as well as the cultural, political, and historical resonances her oeuvre has for us today.<br>

  Abstract: Scholars of Hindutva have argued that in the context of communal violence in India a heightened sense of vulnerability among members of the Hindu middle and lower middle class is integral to the legitimization of violence, where a “majority” feels threatened by a “minority” (Jaffrelot 1996; Hansen 1999; Nussbaum 2007). In the state of Gujarat, this process includes the projection of a lack of vulnerability onto Muslims, expressed and rationalized by reference to diet, worship, and sexuality.<br>

  Abstract: In her project of revisioning moral philosophy, Edith Wyschogrod takes a decisive turn from moral theory to hagiography, from abstract analysis and argument to concrete life stories. The negative motivation for this turn is a critique of moral theory. Two elements of this critique strike me as especially forceful. First, moral theory depends on arguments that do not persuade those outside the hermeneutic circle within which the arguments occur. Thus she points to “the circularity of standard modes of rationality.”¹ The problem is that “background claims … cannot be agreed upon. If there is no common frame of reference, no<br>

In fact, there is almost no reference to (nonhuman) animals anywhere in his work and a tree is mentioned only once and in that case is listed together with a triangle as a “technical object” and thus a “poor” phenomenon.² Marion has never<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

  Book Title: Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunworth Felicity<br>
  Abstract: "Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage" is a study of the dramatised mother figure in English drama from the mid-sixteenth to the early seventeenth centuries. It explores a range of genres: moralities, histories, romantic comedies, city comedies, domestic tragedies, high tragedies, romances and melodrama and includes close readings of plays by such diverse dramatists as Udall, Bale, Phillip, Legge, Kyd, Marlowe, Peele, Shakespeare, Middleton, Dekker and Webster. The study is enriched by reference to religious, political and literary discourses of the period, from Reformation and counter-Reformation polemic to midwifery manuals and Mother’s Legacies, the political rhetoric of Mary I, Elizabeth I and James VI, reported gallows confessions of mother convicts and Puritan conduct books. It thus offers scholars of literature, drama, art and history a unique opportunity to consider the literary, visual and rhetorical representation of motherhood in the context of a discussion of familiar and less familiar dramatic texts.<br>

  Abstract: The editorial comment in John 2:17 (“His disciples remembered that it was written, ‘Zeal for your house will consume me’”) interrupts the narrative flow between the account of Jesus’s actions in the temple (vv. 14–16) and the inquiry by “the Jews”¹ as to what sign Jesus gives for acting as he does (v. 18). Interpreters disagree about the significance and function of the citation of Ps 69:9 in verse 17, but most agree that “will consume” (καταφάγεται) is a reference to Jesus’s death, and nearly all agree that “zeal for your house” (ὁ ζῆλος τοῦ οἴκου σου) refers to<br>

  Abstract: Edward Schillebeeckx makes no reference in his published works to Papua New Guinea—a nation of seven million people in Oceania. With the exception of those trained in Catholic seminaries, very few people in Papua New Guinea would have heard of the theologian, Schillebeeckx. Yet, his theology, particularly his efforts to find alternatives to dualistic thinking about Christian presence in the world, could contribute to developments in local theologies in a place such as Papua New Guinea. This chapter will focus on Schillebeeckx’s understanding of political holiness and will enter into dialogue with the Melanesian thinking of Bernard Narokobi—perhaps<br>

Church councils, church authorities, preachers, teachers, and so many others contribute to our understanding of the phrase, from literal to highly metaphoric. Leuven professor Msgr Raymond Collins in that most orthodox of reference works,The New Jerome Biblical Commentary,in his article on Inspiration, writes: ‘This traditional formula [the word of God], apparently simple, is extremely complex and polyvalent.’²<br>

This principle underwrites Maxims of Conversation underlying our ability to communicate. One of these, the so-called Maxim of Relation, simply specifies this: Be Relevant.

  Book Title: Facing the Other-John Paul II, Levinas, and the Body<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): de Malherbe Brice<br>
  Abstract: What is the significance of the body? What might phenomenology contribute to a theological account of the body? And what is gained by prolonging the overlooked dialogue between St. John Paul II and Emmanuel Levinas? Nigel Zimmermann answers these questions through the agreements and the tensions between two of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. John Paul II, the Polish pope, philosopher, and theologian, and Emmanuel Levinas, the French-Jewish philosopher of Lithuanian heritage, were provocative thinkers who courageously faced and challenged the assumptions of their age. Both held the human person in high regard and did their thinking with constant reference to God and to theological language. Zimmermann does not shirk from the challenges of each thinker and does not hide their differences. However, he shows how they bequeath a legacy regarding the body that we would overlook at significant ethical peril. We are called, Zimmermann argues, to face the other. In this moment God refuses a banal marginalisation and our call to responsibility for the other person is issued in their disarming vulnerability. In the body, philosophy, theology, and ethics converge to call us to glory, even in the paradox of lowly suffering.<br>

Of the examples of friendship and dialogue in which Wojtyla engaged, an overlooked discourse is that which he held with Emmanuel Levinas, a Lithuanian-born French-Jewish intellectual. This particular dialogue cannot be understood without reference to religion, phenomenology, and postmodernity. Moreover, key publications<br>

As the title indicates, these essays on Bonhoeffer’s social thought are motivated by an anthropological concern: When we consider the rapid scientific advances of genetics and globally recurring human atrocities, does it not become apparent that human dignity requires a transcendent reference point?

  Abstract: As stated in chapter 2, every religious symbol expresses, either explicitly or implicitly, a threefold referentiality: (1) reference to some notion of ultimate reality, the sacred, or God; (2) reference to a concept of the human; and (3) reference to a specific vision of the world. The Christian symbol of divine suffering naturally exhibits that threefold referentiality in both the explicit symbol and its twofold presupposition. Thus, in these two primary presuppositions, the human and God do not relate to one another in some sort of vacuum. The human (Ο άνθρωπος) and God (Ο θεός) relate to one another in<br>

Extensive content analysis of Canadian radio program schedules during the 1930s in Vancouver, Montreal, and Halifax questions some of the long-held historical misconceptions about Canadian radio.

  Book Title: Analogies of Transcendence-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): FIELDS STEPHEN M.<br>
  Abstract: The problem of nature and grace lies at the heart of Christian theology. No dimension of divine revelation can be addressed without implicitly drawing reference to this issue.Analogies of Transcendence focuses on the central role that the analogies of being and faith play in developing a solution to the problem. These link God, as self-manifesting transcendence, to the human person as both fallen and justified, and to the material cosmos. Although the proposed solution draws on the work of Maréchal, de Lubac, Balthasar, and Rahner, it criticizes their approach for its underdeveloped analogies that diminish nature in grace's engagement with it. In redressing this weakness, Fr. Fields adapts its solution to the intellectual struggle of our time. This volume examines the origins and structure of modernity, which, it asserts, has not been superseded and is therefore critical of'‘postmodernism,' as well as of some ambiguous legacies of Thomism.<br>

  Abstract: After the epochal collapse of state-level societies at the end of the Bronze Age, most of the eastern Mediterranean experienced new forms of statehood for which new social identities were essential. The old system’s failure to prevent disaster would have discredited earlier ideologies defining personal achievement and social status through reference to the supernatural (for the Aegean, see Mikrakis 2013, 229–30, with references). Practices revolving around the human body, the handiest tool for survival in periods of hardship such as in the so-called Dark Age that followed the collapse, would have increased sharply, causing tensions and conflicts.<br>

  Abstract: Neurotransmitters and their receptors appeared very early in animal evolution, and their structural genes have not changed much since. We have even found ancestors of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in ancient bacteria! Our understanding of this receptor has progressed greatly in the last few years, and it remains easily the best known of all neurotransmitter receptors and is one of the best reference models.<br>

They correspond to the ways by which human beings experience (or can experience) the world view in the political world. In Jaspers’ picture of the political sphere we find the type of the apolitical man as the political leader, the pure politician as the fanatic of the pure ideal. By presenting different political moods, Jaspers expounds ideas about the world view, about its relationship with the whole and with the individual<br>

During the 2008 presidential election, one of Barack Obama’s campaign pledges was that he would elevate American politics to a plateau of unity beyond the divisiveness of the 1960s. The John McCain campaign, for its part, tried repeatedly to tarnish Obama’s luster by dramatizing his association during the early days of his political career with former 1960s radical William Ayers.

  Book Title: The Spirit of God-Short Writings on the Holy Spirit<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Clifford Catherine E.<br>
  Abstract: Yves Congar was the most significant voice in Catholic pneumatology in the twentieth century. This new collection of short pieces makes his thought accessible to a broad range of readers - scholars, teachers, ecumenists and laity - and thus helps to ensure that an important theological voice, one that influenced many of the documents of the Second Vatican Council, continues to be heard.
      The Spirit of Godbrings together for the first time eight of Yves Congar's previously untranslated writings on the Holy Spirit composed after Vatican II (from 1969 to 1985). Two of these selections offer general overviews of Congar's pneumatology, a pneumatology based upon Scripture and the Tradition of the Church, but articulated in conversation with philosophers, ecumenical partners and non-believers. Other articles make clear the historical context of Vatican II's pneumatology and the Holy Spirit's crucial influence upon the unfolding of history and upon the moral life, the efficacy of the sacraments and, especially, upon ecclesial life.The writings inThe Spirit of Godhave been translated and edited by a team of scholars familiar with the work of the French Dominican theologian. An introduction situates each of the writings historically and highlights its theological significance. A bibliography lists Congar's publications on the Holy Spirit, the major articles and books written about his pneumatology, and the major scholarly resources to which Congar made reference in the notes that accompanied these writings. An index of biblical references and of personal names is also included.<br>

  Abstract: Whatever disagreements there may be among historians about the provenance, nature, and scope of the intellectual innovations originating in Israel, Greece, Iran, China, and India during Karl Jaspers’ “Axial Age,” the emergence of critical reflection on the source and use of political power by reference to some transcendental ethical standard marks a major transition in human cultural evolution. How does it come about where and when it does? And what accounts for the different forms that it takes?<br>

  Abstract: Part I suggested the theory of time which underwrites Marcel’s philosophy to be problematic, for although he plainly declares his lack of interest in its ontology, he nevertheless is concerned with human Being. Owing to the temporal character of human existence, time is thus necessarily bound up with Marcel’s ontological investigations. The conclusions he draws from his phenomenological
                  approches concrètes, which make reference to both an experience of finitude and of eternity, therefore (indirectly) reify what Marcel only intended to be a phenomenological distinction between time and eternity. As such, Marcel’s philosophy of time emerges as paradoxically concerned, and unconcerned,<br>

It can also enable us to dispense with the traditional beliefs in original sin, the Fall, and redemptive atonement, or propitiatory sacrifice, along with the inherent historical and intellectual difficulties that have been raised by these beliefs.

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

  Abstract: The development of explicit hermeneutical reflection bears the signature of modernity. As shown above with reference to Nietzsche and Habermas, what distinguishes the modern world-picture is its consciousness of being perspectival. As soon as it becomes evident that worldviews do not merely duplicate reality as it is in itself, but are instead pragmatic interpretations embraced by our language-world, then hermeneutics comes into its own. Only with the advent of modernity has this occurred. For this reason, it is hardly accidental that the Latin word
                  hermeneuticafirst emerges in the seventeenth century. Yet modern insights can be traced back to antiquity,<br>

If so, is primary awareness regionally localized?

  Abstract: Michel Tournier is a writer who explores complex philosophical questions in the guise of concrete, imagistic narratives. This comprehensive study privileges the notion of literary reference, by which the world of text is understood or experienced in metaphorical relation to the world outside of it. Metaphor, in the context of Tournier’s fiction, shows how the fantastic merges with the real to provide new perspectives on many diverse aspects of the modern world: the Crusoe myth, Nazism, the value to society of art and religion, and the nature of education. This book elucidates an aesthetic of Tournier’s fiction that encompasses the writer’s stated ambition to ‘go beyond literature’.<br>

Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy. However, according to Jacques Derrida’s deconstructive practice, the philosopher’s discourse is itself shot through with metaphor. It<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

Miles Davis’s music, too, can be interpreted as a counter-discourse. The literature of the Caribbean and jazz music in the United States belong in fact to areas of cultural activity which have comparable histories despite their dissimilarities. A comparative approach to Glissant’s writing and the trumpet player’s improvisations can therefore allow us to reflect on the connections between strategies of resistance and, on the other hand,<br>

Pointing to a particular thing, Adam declared it to be, I assume, an animal and, as a particular instance among animals, a cow. Figures of speech and figures of thought were not required; the name covered everything, literally, that needed to be said. Anything in the world<br>

  Book Title: Japanese Philosophy-A Sourcebook<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Maraldo John C.<br>
  Abstract: With
      Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook,readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time.TheSourcebookeditors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition-not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics.An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index.Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use,Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebookwill be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come. It will be an essential reference for anyone interested in traditional or contemporary Japanese culture and the way i~<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hatten Robert<br>
  Abstract: Based on the assumption that music cannot be described without reference to its meaning, Raymond Monelle proposes that works of the Western classical tradition be analyzed in terms of temporality, subjectivity, and topic theory. Critical of the abstract analysis of musical scores, Monelle argues that the score does not reveal music's
         sense.That sense--what a piece of music says and signifies--can be understood only with reference to history, culture, and the other arts. Thus, music is meaningful in that it signifies cultural temporalities and themes, from the traditional manly heroism of the hunt to military power to postmodern "polyvocality."<br>

During the 2008 presidential election, one of Barack Obama’s campaign pledges was that he would elevate American politics to a plateau of unity beyond the divisiveness of the 1960s.

  Book Title: Touching the World-Reference in Autobiography<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAKIN PAUL JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Paul John Eakin's earlier work Fictions in Autobiography is a key text in autobiography studies. In it he proposed that the self that finds expression in autobiography is in fundamental ways a kind of fictive construct, a fiction articulated in a fiction. In this new book Eakin turns his attention to what he sees as the defining assumption of autobiography: that the story of the self does refer to a world of biographical and historical fact. Here he shows that people write autobiography not in some private realm of the autonomous self but rather in strenuous engagement with the pressures that life in culture entails. In so demonstrating, he offers fresh readings of autobiographies by Roland Barthes, Nathalie Sarraute, William Maxwell, Henry James, Ronald Fraser, Richard Rodriguez, Henry Adams, Patricia Hampl, John Updike, James McConkey, and Lillian Hellman. In the introduction Eakin makes a case for reopening the file on reference in autobiography, and in the first chapter he establishes the complexity of the referential aesthetic of the genre, the intricate interplay of fact and fiction in such texts. In subsequent chapters he explores some of the major contexts of reference in autobiography: the biographical, the social and cultural, the historical, and finally, underlying all the rest, the somatic and temporal dimensions of the lived experience of identity. In his discussion of contemporary theories of the self, Eakin draws especially on cultural anthropology and developmental psychology.<br>

  Abstract: THE SYSTEM of classification long in place in our libraries and bibliographies posits the kinship of autobiography and biography, ranging them both under the aegis of history as categories of the literature of reference, kinds of writing determined by their presumed basis in verifiable fact. Yet it is precisely with regard to this central identifying feature of reference to a world beyond the text that theory of autobiography today differs from the practice of biography. Thus it has become commonplace for students of autobiography to assert that the past, the ostensible primary reference of such texts, is a fiction. As<br>

  Abstract: In writings by the French post-structuralists, rhetorical tropes such as speechlessness, fragmentation, and deflection testify to the writer's difficulty in broaching the subject of love. Similarly, Cook shows that love poetry proceeds out of a profound failure of language resulting from the opacity of discourse, its lack of neutrality, or the fugitive transparency of reference. Writing Lovers also explores race, ethnicity, age, and sexual identity within the context of the passionate excesses of amatory discourse.<br>

  Book Title: Poetics of Reading-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMMERS INGE CROSMAN<br>
  Abstract: What happens when we read novels and how do we make sense of them? Inge Wimmers explores these questions by developing a flexible poetics of reading that generously opens up the interpretive space between reader and text, while drawing on current theories of reading and combining rhetorical, pragmatic, and phenomenological approaches. "Poetics," here, is extended beyond the study of purely textual features to structures of exchange between text and reader. In a discussion of four major French novels from the seventeenth century to the present, the author not only sets up a broad-based poetics but also makes important contributions to contemporary issues in the study of narrative. Wimmers introduces the concept of multiple, interlocking frames of reference that allows for the integration of diverse critical perspectives. Analyzing La Princesse de Cleves, Madame Bovary, A la recherche du temps perdu, and Projet pour une revolution a New York, she shows how texts provide some frames of reference, while others are produced by the reader's disposition and cultural milieu.<br>

Readings differ depending on the kind of novel being read and the reader’s purpose, interests, and ideology. By opening the interpretive space between reader and text to include both text interpretation and self-interpretation, the frames of reference that come into play are multiplied. Moreover, the emphasis in recent theories of reading on emotional response—in particular the enjoyment readers get from taking an active part—opens up new directions for a<br>

  Abstract: When raising the question of the reader’s status in the text, we may have in mind two sets of problems. According to one approach, the reader is thought of as an end conceived by the writer, whose work, accordingly, may be read in reference to the idea we have of that reader. A certain number of studies have enriched the history of literary criticism in this way, showing that the expectations of a particular public aimed at by the writer were determinative down to the most secret strata of the text (Jauss’s

More precisely, purposive ambiguity is that for which reference to a hypothetical intention has explanatory force.

The verifying structure can be briefly summarized. Beginning with a distinction between flesh and spirit, it was deduced, ultimately, from Plato, and, in various guises, it posited an ironic tension between archetype and image, on the participation of the image in the archetype, and on the actual presence of the archetype in the image of likeness.

But Oakeshott’s point is worth repeating: as a learning process deeply rooted in the particular historical circumstances of a people, ordinary politics is a matter of intimations. It is the activity of translating and inscribing the allusive fluctuations of everyday collective existence into familiar and routine terms of reference. Politics,<br>

  Abstract: When we return from resignation to the world of society, we turn to a certain tradition of justice and injustice, though the principles by which people attempt to derive laws from claims of reason often obscure the idea that justice itself may be a tradition. But what does it mean to say that there is a tradition of modern justice? And what are its insufficiencies? Kafka’s question might not even be posed in reference to justice but only in reference to punishment, which surely must be something different, even metaphorically. Our most banal and common metaphor of justice is the<br>

  Author(s) Taiana Cecilia<br>
  Abstract: FOR ANYONE, ARTIST OR NOT, the experience of exile is bound to be upsetting to their happiness and well-being (if such things really exist). It matters little whether such an uprooting is the result of voluntary emigration in search of a better world or forcible banishment from one’s homeland. The loss of points of reference, of the feeling of belonging, combined with an abrupt break in the continuity and evolution of a person’s life, are overwhelming and can lead to an acute sense of disorientation and chaos, especially if the person is a writer.<br>

  Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, artists have explored the status of documentary reference and the material trace in the gallery with increasing frequency. In part, this line of investigation stems from a situation in which the power of documentary images has been met with a widespread cultural uncertainty about their trustworthiness. As Hito Steyerl and Maria Lind write: ‘The double bind is strong: on the one hand documentary images are more powerful than ever. On the other hand, we have less and less trust in documentary representations’ (2008: 1). In response to this uncertainty, artists and filmmakers alike have turned increasingly to<br>

  Author(s) Horton Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The question of the Brechtian quality of Angelopoulos’ political period might initially appear outmoded and obsolete given that a number of scholars have already acknowledged Brecht’s influence, predominantly in the filmmaker’s historical tetralogy. None of the scholars in question, however, have attempted to approach the Brechtian aspect of Angelopoulos with reference to the former’s writings on film, nor from the perspective of the Brechtian concept of

The problem in grasping what is at stake in these relations and the differences that animate them lies in the fact that the only way to approach them is through the inherited concepts themselves: word, thing, idea. Couplings like form and matter, form and meaning, syntax and semantics, signifier and signified all owe their senses (we must not I suppose exclude sense and reference) to this ancient framework.

  Abstract: I want to outline some of the main developments in the philosophy of mind in the last half of the twentieth century. Behaviorism dominated psychology during approximately the same period that logical positivism dominated philosophy. The principles of behaviorism are less easily stated than those of logical positivism. It is perhaps better seen as a method that eschewed use of mentalistic vocabulary in favor of terms that made reference to dispositions to behavior. Both movements aimed at banishing nonscientific speculation, and forcing theory to hew as closely as possible to methods of confirmation. Both methodological doctrines came to be seen<br>

The urge that prompts this investigation is not only abstract, but also very practical. Nomadic philosophy mobilises one’s affectivity and enacts the desire for in-depth transformations in the status of the kind of subjects we have become. Such in-depth changes, however, are at best demanding and at worst painful processes.

Protest over the war in Vietnam stirred recollections of these earlier debates about the historical context and social function of both literature and criticism, but masked the simultaneous and more enduring infusion of European theory into American criticism. While Paul de Man contributed a quite orthodox essay to Reuben Brower and Richard Poirier’s New Critical collection

  Abstract: In analyzing any ideological discourse, we are struck by its ambiguity and fuzziness; both Chatterjee and Hobsbawm have pointed this out in reference to the discourses of liberalism and nationalism, as we have seen in chapter 3.¹ The same indeterminacy applies to discourses of gender, for they also operate within an ideological field intersected by a multiplicity of discourses. Consequently, there can be no essential gender discourse, only gender discourses in articulation with other discourses, like those of nation, race/caste, religion, family, class, and sexuality, all of which articulate with one another and generate a variety of social identities.

The matter continues to be of central importance in Habermas’s discussions of “late capitalism,” where he seeks to offer a political-sociological diagnosis of the times.

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas-Fogiel begins with postphilosophical claims such as scientism, which she reveals to be self-refuting, for they subsume philosophy into the branches of the natural sciences. She discovers similar issues in Rorty's skepticism and strands of continental thought. Revisiting the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century philosophers, when the split between analytical and continental philosophy began, Thomas-Fogiel finds both traditions followed the same path-the road of reference-which ultimately led to self-contradiction. This phenomenon, whether valorized or condemned, has been understood as the death of philosophy. Tracing this pattern from Quine to Rorty, from Heidegger to Levinas and Habermas, Thomas-Fogiel reveals the self-contradiction at the core of their claims while also carving an alternative path through self-reference. Trained under the French philosopher Bernard Bourgeois, she remakes philosophy in exciting new ways for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: In Kant, the dual question of reference and self-reference is left to be read from his terms “representation” and “reflection”—representation embodying the mind’s movement toward what is not itself, namely, the object; reflection, the mind’s questioning of its own structures. And yet, in the Kantian system, the conjunction of these two notions turns out to be, in the final analysis, impossible. This impossibility is expressed in a strange oxymoron, the use of which causes the entire framework to implode. To demonstrate the incompatibility between these two orientations, I must first bring out the meaning of the term “representation” and<br>

  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

In the preceding two chapters we dealt with the question of the role to be assigned to reference and truth in (historical) representation. We found that representations cannot be said to refer to the world in the way proper names and sentences do, though they can be characterized as self-referential. Similarly, the notion of truth can meaningfully be used in the context of representation, not in the sense of propositional truth but in the quasi-Heideggerian sense of truth as a revelation of a past reality.

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world. Genese Grill holds a PhD in Germanic Literatures and Languages from the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br>

When inquiring whether a new claim fits within the substantive range of the Due Process Clause, the U.S. Supreme Court sets course to explore whether the right or liberty interest asserted by the petitioner is “deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition.” It was in 
                  Bowers v Hardwick² where the U.S. Supreme Court, per Justice White, sought evidence to establish whether the “history and traditions of the Nation”<br>

Abstract: The “stamen” is the organic germ out of which the body develops. “It is very well known,” writes Nieuwentijt, “to those that are versed in the Inquiries of the present Age,” that plants, animals, and humans “consist of a first Principle or
            Stamen,which may therefore be denominated theownBody” (
                  , 3:1054). Nieuwentijt does not mention authors but makes clear his reference to contemporary embryology and, in particular, to the observations on the formation of the chick in the egg that Marcello Malpighi had reported to the Royal Society in 1672. In Malphighi’s vocabulary, the latin wordRP
               stamen(filament, thread) designated the earliest detectable traces of the embryo. The filaments were supposed to be preformed within the egg and to constitute the rudiments of the entire mature organism (figs. 2aand2b).91

In the center there is a “cinereus saccule” or “follicle” (B) floating in a “colliquament” (C) that resembles molten glass and is surrounded by circles of solid (D, F, H) and fluid (E, G, I) matter. The fetus (L), wrote Malpighi, is enclosed in the saccule “as if in an amnion; and its head, with thestaminaof thecarina[first rudiments of the spinal cord] appended to it, was clearly evident.” From: Howard B.

Abstract: The group did depend on institutional reference points in a way—they served as a backdrop for enacting an anti‐institutional stance. Buffaloes viewed the social landscape as hostile; they often talked about who was trying to rip off whom and who was charging too much for what and about the bargains they had gotten. They assumed that commercial and other institutions were trying to fool them or steal from them. But they assumed that that was the institutions’ job, just as it was the consumer’s job to outsmart them. In other words, at least market institutions were
               honestin theirself‐interestedness. But when anyone made a speech or propagandized for a cause or a product at the club, members made a strenuous effort to avoid being fooled.<br>

Abstract: Linguistic anthropology is not a unified field, but it does have some commonly held theoretical views and practices. Many have been consistent over time. Two obvious ones are the importance of learning a field language and the importance of collecting language data, understood broadly as anything from eliciting text to recording naturally occurring speech, for a variety of research aims. As for a general model of language as culture, there is a clear shared sense that language is structured and structuringthat it is a cultural practice both deriving from and helping to constitute society and culture. Linguistic phenomena have unconscious character (as Boas argued) as well as regularities of communicative practice and certain persistent features of reference (Sapir
         1949:104) that function in the production of shared meaning or some approximation of it. Well before the linguistic anthropologists of Durantis third paradigm started thinking about practice theory and performativity, Sapir articulated this view: While we often speak of society as though it were a static structure defined by tradition it is only apparently a static sum of social institutions; actually it is being reanimated or creatively reaffirmed from day to day by particular acts of a communicative nature which obtain among the individuals participating in it.b[1931]<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Although an influential figure within German social theory for decades, Luhmann has never been an especially popular figure in American circles, perhaps because his theory is in actuality what many sociologists have accused Parson’s of being: a theory reducing social actors to nothing more than epiphenomena of their social system. Hence, Luhmann’s book consists of his application of concepts such as system/environment, medium/form, first‐ and second‐order observation, self‐reference and external reference and above all the distinction between psychic systems (systems of consciousness) and social systems (systems of communication) to the realm of art, thereby conceptually transforming it into the “art system.” One of the ironies in Luhmann’s analysis is that his claim for the “autonomy of art” is seemingly refuted by his own, wholly social, assessment of it. Indeed, reading Luhmann’s book is a little like watching Frankenstein at work: his conceptual apparatus renders the ostensibly organic associations we might have of art as being instead mechanical and clinical. For all of Parsons’s own romance with systems theory and cybernetics, his central concern was always with the cultural product of those systems, which he referred to variously as “instrumental activism” and “institutionalized individualism,” that is, the way in which differentiation led to the production of a more complex and sophisticated individualism within the societal community. This constituted Parsons’s standard for the evolution of societies. Luhmann, meanwhile, consistently held that social systems operate “behind the backs” of actors, operating to reduce complexity for such actors, on the one hand, while furthering systems imperatives, on the other. This contrast between mentor and student becomes most obvious in their respective views of culture: while Parsons never fully unpacked the concept of culture in his own work, his emphasis on values and norms opened the door to what today is known as t~<br>

Abstract: Just as North Africa provided a defining perspective that turned his thinking upside down, teaching in Brazil and captivity in German prisoner‐of‐war camps also gave Braudel important reflective distance. Brazil provided a different kind of colonial perspective to look across the ocean at the Mediterranean as through a distant mirror. For Braudel, Brazil’s stark class divisions resembled an earlier stage of European economic development and a way to look back in time at the origins of modern capitalism in the Mediterranean. “Brazil is the same civilization [as ours], but not at the same age. It is true that Brazil allowed me to arrive at a certain conception of history that I would not have had if I had remained round about the Mediterranean.”
         115Prison camp, in contrast, brought enforced solitude to contemplate the whole, away from the jumble of details in Braudel’s notes. Prison was a “long time of testing … a good school. It teaches patience, tolerance.” The Mediterranean “distracted me in the true etymological meaning of the word,” and Braudel wrote his book. “Only my memory permitted this tour de force. Had it not been for my imprisonment, I would surely have written quite a different book.… Far removed from our persons and our daily misery, history was being made, shifting slowly, as slowly as the ancient life of the Mediterranean, whose perdurability and majestic immobility has so often moved me. So it was that I consciously set forth in search of a historical language—the most profound I could grasp or invent—in order to present unchanging (or at least very slowly changing) conditions which stubbornly assert themselves over and over again.”116Braudel’s memory juxtaposed the repetition of the routines of daily life amid a sea of imperceptible change with the retelling of the same events during the reign of Philip II from different frames of reference in the three parts of his book, so that the temporal linkage between structure‐conjuncture‐event woul~<br>

Abstract: So Hotchkiss, Kilduff, and Janis,
            Handbook of Business English,p. 25: “All this is because the prime purpose of the letter is to transmit a business message. If the reader understands it as the writer intended, and acts favorably upon it as the writer wishes, it has done its work.” Similar strictures on indulgence in rhetorical techniques can be found in another important statement in the field of business English, McDonald,English and Science,pp. v–vi, 1–5. Although it might appear that a similar characterization can be made of scientific writing, which refrains from certain conspicuous rhetorical strategies, scientific writing is different in crucial respects from the mode of information genres, principally in the fact that information does not have the same argumentative sufficiency in science it does for the informational genres. Kinneavy’s discussion is suggestive on this point. He argues that for “reference discourse,” which is roughly (though not exactly) equivalent to what I call informational discourse (Kinneavey includes journalism in his category), “the logic of subject matter rather than the logic of proof frequently provides the matrix of organization” (TD, p. 152).<br>

Abstract: The Christocentric requirement can best be understood in terms of the first of the above‐mentioned interpretive movements. The world of contemporary experience is interpreted in light of the claims of the tradition. Thus, for example, the human predicament (for which Tillich asserts Christianity provides the answers) will itself be cast in terms of the Christian message; contemporary questions will be formulated in light of Christian answers. Theologians like George Lindbeck (building on the work of Hans Frei) and Tracy appeal to contemporary theories of literary reference to understand this capacity of a religious tradition to shape human experience.
         16According to such theories, the reference of a text stands in front of it, namely, in the world this text opens up for the reader. Thus the Christian “text”—consisting of the classic texts of the Christian tradition, founded upon, but not restricted to, the Christian Bible—projects a domain of meaning in which Christians are to locate—and thereby to redefine—their own experiences of reality.17The traditional notion of the imitation of Christ, for example, can be fruitfully understood in terms of this concept of “intratextuality.” Personal suffering acquires redemptive significance for a Christian when it is experienced as an imitation of Christ’s suffering; to suffer as a Christian is to be imaginatively present with Christ in his agony.18According to George Lindbeck, the primary task of the theologian is to extend the domain of meaning projected by the Bible to the whole of reality.19<br>

Abstract: Arriving at this synthesis and then going beyond it, Gare shows how process philosophy both acknowledges the achievements made by the so‐called idealists, including the difficulties in their project, and yet still manages to give prominence to nature or the physical world, rather than to consciousness, as the primary reference point for making the world intelligible [
         5]. Having made this move, process thinkers can then allow for the emergence of consciousness: “Much bolder than the ‘idealists’, these are the philosophers and scientists who have argued that whatever its achievements, the mainstream tradition of science must be fundamentally wrong, that nature must be such that consciousness, fully appreciated as such, can be conceived as part of nature. This requires that at least some of the central characteristics of consciousness must be central characteristics of all that exists, including non‐living physical entities. Accordingly, they have called for a transformation or revolution in science on the basis of a new conception of nature from which consciousness could evolve” [5, p. 5].<br>

Abstract: But it is precisely because universalism seems undone by the inclusion of racial difference that the terms of this incorporation need to be carefully scrutinized. In a remarkably prescient analysis of sexism and racism, with particular reference to black women, Elizabeth V. Spelman refers to the critical practice of seeing as extra the racial burden that black women had to bear as “additive analysis.” Spelman writes, “An additive analysis treats the oppression of a black woman in a sexist and racist society as if it were a
      furtherburden than her oppression in a sexist but non‐racist society, when, in fact, it is adifferentburden” (1982, 43). Additive analysis, in other words, seeks to incorporate particularities and differences as additions to a common universalist narrative. Two decades since the publication of Spelman’s essay, additive analysis still continues, albeit in different forms. By examining the terms of racial incorporation in two essays published in the mid‐1980s—Gayle Rubin’s “Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality” (1984) and Donna Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist‐Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century” (1991; this essay first appeared inSocialist Reviewin 1985)—I argue that these essays offer the dominant paradigm for the imperialist incorporation of women of color in contemporary gender and sexuality studies: incorporation by analogy. This strategy denies primacy to the voices of the colonized that have proclaimed the preeminence of the racial difference, so memorably articulated by Frantz Fanon inBlack Skin, White Masks: “‘Dirty nigger!’ Or simply, ‘Look, a Negro’” ([1952] 1967, 109).<br>

Abstract: In order to recognize another's worth bona fide, one has to make an assessment in light of some standard of evaluation, and, in the absence of a genuinely global culture with a horizon or perspective more comprehensive than and inclusive of the perspectives of the individual communities, one cannot help having recourse to one’s parochial point of view and treating it as somehow universally relevant and applicable. The inevitability of a particular perspective in recognition of worth is all the more the case for religious communities that make universalistic and ultimate truth claims, such as the Christian assertion of the centrality and universality of the salvation achieved by God in and through Jesus Christ. For Christian communities their recognition of other ways of life cannot avoid being given—or not given—in reference to the divine will and practice which they believe have been disclosed for all people in Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection.<br>

Abstract: To conclude, the frequent reference to Midrash within Frei’s work shows its importance in its connection with the central tenets of his work: its intertextuality, grammatical sense, focus on self‐description, pluralism, and particularity all illuminate these dimensions of the literal sense and thereby help Frei to articulate how the literal sense, from a Christian perspective, exceeds the grasp of modern hermeneutics. Simultaneously, its focus on verbal typology, as opposed to narrative ascription, clarifies via contrast the distinctive typological practice of reading that Frei envisages as central to Christian community. The similarities and differences, together, demonstrate that the literal sense, on Frei’s view, always remains something that exceeds the grasp of any one community or reading. Ultimately, perhaps, one should say that the identity of the literal sense would be the conjunction, or reconciliation, of the communities rooted in these two intertextual approaches to reading, as well as their parabolic engagement with the broader world.<br>

Abstract: The first number of volume four, for example, contains six essays, totaling a little over 100 pages, of unfootnoted text. To further confuse matters, for reasons yet to be determined (whether originating with the authors or with the journal’s editors or staff) two essays in volume 4, number 4, and a few others as well, contain imbedded footnotes, that is, reference material in the text, and no footnotes. The first issue that was completely, thoroughly, unabashedly footnoted was volume 5, number 2, winter 1978. Sheldon Sacks died in early 1979; as far as we can tell, the date of the first issue without an unfootnoted essay is entirely arbitrary.<br>

Abstract: To foster this relationship, the teachers in the school typically stand at the front of their rooms, and from a very young age, their students are taught to learn by listening. In almost every grade in the school, the children’s desks sit in neat rows facing the blackboards. Reference to the Bible occurs during every subject, not only in religion classes, and it is typical for prayers to begin class sessions. Moreover, a strict dress code is enforced; the students wear khaki pants or skirts and solid colored jerseys every day except Wednesdays, when the students dress more formally for weekly chapel sessions. Wide banners adorned the main school hallways, proclaiming “God, protect us” and “Expand our providence.” Eternal Grace aims to foster the characteristics of good fundamentalist Christian children: they are to be strong in their faith, obedient to their religious authorities, humble in their human relationships, and dedicated to Christian salvation. Like the school‐wide policies, the teaching of all school subjects at Eternal Grace serves the same purpose—that of elucidating for students what a “proper relationship to God” entails.<br>

Abstract: This is not easy, because the point at issue in the dialogue model has two pairs of perspectives: first, the participant and observer perspective, and second, the perspective of self and other. The importance of these two pairs of perspectives has already been alluded to. I have indicated that both pairs entail epistemic angles; they merely differ in regard to their regulatory principles. The observer versus participant perspective is regulated sociospatially in terms of distance and proximity (distancing and belonging), whereas the self‐perspective versus other perspective has an interpersonal regulatory principle. But both self‐perspective and other perspective are participant perspectives and are aimed at mutual participation. It is essential to distinguish between the two sets of contrasts lest one ends up in conceptual confusion. A further point is that, while the self‐perspective versus other perspective is more important for interreligious dialogue, a lesser but nonetheless essential role is reserved for the other pair, participant versus observer perspective. I shall not confine myself to these general comments but will explicate them with reference to three conditions for interreligious dialogue: information exchange, perspective exchange, and perspective coordination.

Abstract: It is appropriate at this point to go back and “recall” the opening reminiscences of this text. This recollection is no longer the same as the initial experience, of course; it is inflected by the thoughts that have come in between. Strictly speaking, only the statues in front of the university would correspond entirely to the notion of
         lieu de mémoireas utilized and defined by Nora. For the generations who were part of the institution‐building efforts of the young state and for whom the figures of the “pre‐Liberation period” were an important component of their immediate childhood memories, and not just textbook entries, the monument to the Brothers Georgievi (placed in 1934) used to be a veritablemilieu de mémoire.
            95To didactic historians, probably the most widely distributed breed among the species, these figures stand as symbols of genuine patriotism and selfless charity to be admired and emulated. To contemporary students, their names mean very little, and few actually know anything about their lives and other exploits. If not entirely forgotten, their huge bronze images, “like seashells on the shore from which the sea of living memory has retreated,” tease the historical memory of college students who pass by them every morning. There is nothing exceptional or unexpected in this. As Reinhart Koselleck has remarked: “Memorials, like all works of art, have a surplus potential to take on a life of their own. For this reason, the original meaning of countless memorials is no longer recognizable without recourse to inscriptions or other empirically comprehensible reference signals.”96<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: This is a thoughtful, wide‐ranging, and ambitious study by an author well established as an insightful cultural historian. Drawing on close and sensitive readings of a number of nineteenth‐ and twentieth‐century novels of homicide and detection, Stephen Kern charts a paradigmatic shift in the nature of fictional causality. Crime novels were chosen for the insight they might offer the historian into “new ways of rendering the causes and motives for human action,” and Kern traces a movement away from the “clear and strongly deterministic causal factors” (p. 4) favored by nineteenth‐century authors in the explanation of transgression toward greater complication and confusion in modernist representations of causal connection. He argues that a chronological reading of murder novels across his chosen period reveals a “multifaceted shift” in five interrelated ways—“namely, that causal understanding moved in the direction of increasing specificity [as a consequence of developments in forensic science, for example], multiplicity, increasing complexity, probability and uncertainty” (p. 6). In the eight chapters that follow, Kern marshals an enormous amount of evidence to trace these shifts in our understandings of the factors that may influence violent action—our ancestral inheritance, our childhood, the ways in which language or education construct our sense of the real or the actual, our sexuality, our emotions, our intellect, our interaction with society in a wider sense, and our ideological commitments. Kern’s range of reference is impressive, and he moves comfortably from the scientific to the literary, the prosaic to the poetic. He is well acquainted with contemporary developments in the ideas of chance, probability, and determinism, and, in particular, he writes knowledgeably of the consequences for fiction of the emergence of quantum theory in the first half of the twentieth century.<br>

Abstract: Derrida asks: “Is the reference to this abyssal dissymmetry that occurs when one is exposed to the gaze of the other a motif that derives firstly and uniquely from Christianity, even if it be from an inadequately thematized Christianity? Let us leave aside the question of whether one finds something that at least represents its equivalent before’ or after’ the Gospels, in Judaism or in Islam” (
            GD,p. 28).<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: As for the JST, one need not look far for its source, nor be concerned with Smith’s knowledge of ancient languages. It is true that, during a brief hiatus between internecine and external battles, Smith established a “school of the prophets” in the frontier town of Kirtland, Ohio, at which English and Hebrew grammar were studied; the latter because of the serendipitous proximity of Joshua Seixas, author of the 1833
         Manual Hebrew Grammar for the Use of Beginners.Whatever mastery Smith achieved over his native tongue, the consensus is that his command of Hebrew was rudimentary. More to the point, his use of it has been deemed more imaginative than expert. “I simply do not think he cared to appear before the world as a meticulous Hebraist,” concluded a modern scholar. Rather, Smith “used the Hebrew as he chose, as an artist, inside his frame of reference, in accordance with his taste, according to the effect he wanted to produce, as a foundation for theological innovations.”27It is unnecessary to speculate on Smith’s linguistic capacities, however, because Smith’s translation of the Bible is based on an 1828 edition of the KJV, printed by H. and E. Phinney of Cooperstown, New York. As a source document for Smith’s translation, the Phinney edition was not only in Smith’s native tongue, but already cured of many obsolete words, as well as archaic spellings and pronouns.28Nevertheless, as indicated above, the JST was titled and uniformly referred to by Smith as a “translation of the scriptures.”29As such, the JST constitutes Smith’s most obvious transgression of the common understanding of what it means to translate.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: What I am contending, then, is that as books become commodities, marketability plays an important role in the emergence of re‐vision as a popular literary genre. Whereas for feminist writers, rewriting is a literary form that combines narrative strategy with feminist praxis, for publishers, re‐vision is a means of selling books with low risks and low marketing costs. Rewritings can be marketed according to the mechanics of branding. This we see clearly in the strategies devised to sell re‐visions on the basis of the prestige that is to be gained from their being associated with canonical names, as when Aiken’s
         Jane Fairfaxis dubbed “a companion volume toEmma.” In the bookstores, text and rewrite are juxtaposed or presented in boxed sets—Gone with the Windand its sequel,Scarlett, by Alexandra Ripley; or Daphne du Maurier’sRebeccaand Susan Hill’sMrs. de Winter.14Book covers and flaps explicitly refer to the precursor text, while layout and lettering reinforce the connection established between text and rewrite. For instance, the mass‐market paperback edition ofRebeccapublished, like Hill’sMrs. de Winter(1994), by Avon Books, states on its back cover:
               Similarly, the November 1994 Avon Books edition ofREBECCAONE OF THE BESTSELLINGNOVELS OF ALL TIMESand don’t miss the exciting and long‐awaited conclusionMRS. DE WINTER
            Mrs. de Winterstates on its back cover:
               On the former book cover, no reference is made to the author of this “exciting and long‐awaited conclusion,” nor is there any indication it might not be the same asMRS.deWINTERThe breathtaking, long‐awaited sequel to
            Daphne du Maurier'sclassic tale of romantic suspenseREBECCARebecca’s. In contrast, on the latter, the name of the author ofRebeccais not only given but also emphasized, while leaving out the name of the author of the book at hand altogether. Clearly, the name of the author ofMrs. de Winteris secondary to what we might call theRebeccabrand. Alt~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: The suspension of truth becomes a methodology for the practice of librarianship, not only in collection development, preservation, and provision of access to information but also in reference services. With the historicist perspective that propositions are affirmed or denied within a spatial‐temporal continuum, librarians working in reference and information services can better understand what underlies knowledge and how that knowledge is transmitted. For example, a patron has just read Dan Brown’s
         The Da Vinci Code[68] and expresses an interest in understanding where the ideas about Jesus and Mary Magdalene as presented in this work of fiction originated. Besides showing the patronHoly Blood, Holy Grailby Michael Baigent and Henry Lincoln [72], the reference librarian can direct the patron to information about the Gnostic tradition in early Christianity through primary and selected scholarly secondary sources. The patron would then learn from these other materials how Gnosticism originated and how it reemerged in various periods of history as heresies opposing the beliefs of traditional Christianity. Using the historicist perspective, reference and information services can better understand the ideas and concepts that underlie knowledge and how that knowledge is transmitted.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Another problem is the book’s unrelenting abstractness. As noted above, issues of nonviolence, solidarity, and dialogue seem to be hovering in the background, but never once does Reynolds mention any actual situation where real communities have confronted these issues. His argument stringently avoids any reference to concrete historical examples. Reynolds also exhibits the dismaying tendency of using simple declarative sentences like these: “The other is a presence who solicits my response by signaling a promise precisely in its distance. Its call is not anonymous, but signifies the trace of something that invites recognition and bids me to pay attention to it. I respond. My world is adjusted. I am transposed, tilted toward the exterior” (113). Where, when, and how are these things actually happening? Only in a vague, theoretical stratosphere? Or in real life? If the latter, why not dwell on a few specific examples? Jargon and underdefined catchphrases further obscure matters: “Thus, meaningful vitality is the constitutive affirmation of being‐with, an affirmation that reflects a presentiment of surplus value intrinsic to the we‐relation” (123).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: Jean Santeuil, the protagonist of Proust’s eponymous and second aborted novel, may be considered a predecessor of Marcel in
         À la recherche du temps perdu.48The narrator ofJean Santeuilrefers to Jean’s “contemplation” as the practice, superior to “pleasure, thought, and memory,” which, willfully embraced, and fueled by imagination, gives us back our “soul” as an aggregate of the “relics of our life.”49In this novel already, as he will later do inÀ la recherche du temps perdu, Proust postulates imagination as a faculty that, unable to apply itself directly either to present circumstances or to past memories,50“floats” around those past realities that are “captured” (prise) by present experience via the mediation of memory.51Although it adheres to Bergson’s principle of “harmonization” between present impression and analogous recollection,52Jean’s contemplation contradicts Bergson’s advocacy of a constantly transformative, hands‐on intervention on reality. When one talks of contemplation in Proust, in fact, obligatory reference must be made to Schopenhauer, whose influence on the French writer was certainly not inferior to Bergson’s.53<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Seen in these terms, just‐war morality can mediate civic virtue and, along with it, civic memory and the quest for meaning in the res publica by disposing citizens to evaluate public policy and public sentiment regarding war along with practices according to which war will be recalled in the future.
         76Such assessments are valuable for citizens across generations, bound as they are in political community. We do well to recall that as a political ethic, just‐war morality presupposes the fact that political communities extend over time. They are, as Benedict Anderson famously argued, transgenerational imaginative structures in which past, present, and future members are conceived in solidarity.77Just‐war morality thus includes virtues that dispose us to assess not only the sentiments of current citizens but also how public history will teach future generations to remember war in the formation of political identity and public culture.78Understood as providing a framework for social criticism, just‐war morality provides a set of objective reference points that enable us to ask whether war is memorable for the right reasons and if the desires evoked by war were desirable and worthy of being transmitted to future citizens.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This multidimensional idea of knowledge bears its fruit in a reconstruction of theological ethics. In very different ways the religions provide guidance for human living, not simply with reference to a center but by answering a range of questions as well as the complex interactions among these questions. The questions demarcate a “space” or environment of human existence determined by the problem of how one ought to live, say, as a Protestant Christian or a Reformed American Jew, a Shiite Muslim or a Tibetan Buddhist. “Morality” is a name for the placement and right conduct of human existence, an outlook and way of life marked by sensibilities and orientations. “Ethics” is the critical, comparative, and constructive thinking about this moral space by answering the question, how should one live a good life? and the various subquestions that problem poses. The validity of an ethics is determined by the scope and intensity of its ability to intersect with other outlooks and disciplines and redeem the pertinence of its claims. An ethics that can intersect with and engage a wider scope of outlooks and positions will attain relatively greater validity than rival options for guiding human lives. That criterion is, actually, what dictated the shape of this lecture. It is why I probed the structure of current lived reality and engaged various thinkers around the question of the formation of responsible existence.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: Such diversity inevitably generates interpretive contradictions and makes the author's stated goals—to compare the films' thematic content and form with those of the colonial cinema that preceded it and to use postcolonial film as a barometer for assessing how French collective memory has come to terms with its imperialist history—difficult to achieve. While Eades's painstaking analysis of the continuities and ruptures between colonial and postcolonial cinema is impressive, her contention that the latter “forced recognition of a reality grudgingly accepted by political authorities and the general population” (22) until the mid‐1990s and “called into question imperial ideology in all its dimensions” (203) is less convincing. While the majority of these films do at some level acknowledge the failures and abuses of French imperialism, most also avoid explicit reference to controversial issues and events (most notably, the French army's practice of torture in Algeria) and ignore the subjective experience of colonized peoples, highlighting instead the plight of colonizers caught in morally untenable situations because of the corrupt system that surrounds them. The result, as Eades recognizes, is that the colonized tend to remain little more than stereotypes while audiences are encouraged to identify with the European perspective. In so doing, postcolonial cinema implicitly perpetuates the epistemological prejudices of overtly imperialist films from the 1920s and 1930s.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This is not Ricoeur at his most accessible, and I would not recommend the work as an entrance point for engaging his corpus. The essays are tough going, and the essays in the second section are particularly difficult. The essays do deal with important themes in Ricoeur’s work, ones especially visible in his later writings. Many of the essays are introduced with footnotes that indicate a debt to previous works, and nearly all the essays make some reference to the “little ethics” of
      Oneself as Anotherbut suggest that knowledge of these works is not necessary. This is not completely true in my estimation; it is difficult to discern where Ricoeur is headed in this volume if one knows little or nothing of where he has been. Some understanding may be gained without previous knowledge, but grounding in previous works is essential for a thorough understanding of this volume.<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Now, Derrida holds that Marion has elided the distinction between praise and prayer, which represent two nominally separable traits. For Derrida, the only language that truly respects distance is, in a formulation that recalls Kant, pure prayer, or the “act of addressing oneself to the other as other.”
         57However, praise, or encomium—even “praise as”—violates the purity of this first trait by compromising the absolute alterity of the Other and bringing reference to bear across address. Thus, “the encomium qualifies God, anddeterminesprayer,determinesthe other.”58Marion held that “praise as” did not attempt to qualify or determine God, but Derrida argues that it “entails a predicative aim, however foreign it may be the ‘normal’ ontological predication.”59However, there is no real question of being able to pray without encomium, for “there would be no prayer … [without] writing, the code, repetition.”60The letter of the prayer, as in Kant, is always impure: how do you address the Other without determining who the addressee is? True prayer is actually impossible. As Hent de Vries puts it, “Prayer is from the outset and forever divided in and against itself.”61<br>

Abstract: William Franke elucidates the theological nature of poetry and the poetic nature of theology. The range of reference is impressive and a challenge to any reviewer. Franke engages the tradition of Christian epic poetry—beginning with scripture, developing through Dante Alighieri, John Milton, and William Blake, and culminating with James Joyce—as well as the modernist poetry of Paul Celan, Wallace Stevens, and T. S. Eliot, and he does so in conversation with negative theology, philosophical hermeneutics, critical theory, and postmodernism. The book’s stated objective is “a postmodern negative theology of poetic language” (ix) that is both theoretical and practical, contributing to both literary theory and theology and promoting peace through radical openness to dialogue, and it is to Franke’s credit that the result is both challenging and accessible.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: In ritual performances in general, the line between suspended literal reference and embraced figurative reference is delicate. Johan Huizinga, Adolf Jensen, and Pierre Smith, among others, have hinted that one must cultivate a ludic appreciation of the events on the ritual stage, whereby one suspends one’s ordinary perspective on the ritual action in order to allow the ritual drama to emerge and to flourish.
         87The reiteration of sanctifying models and exhortations in the last instructions suggests that the 9/11 actors successfully embraced the ludic dimension of the ritual (revival of an ancient war on infidels) quite alongside the ritual’s apparent purpose (to kill passengers and harm the United States).<br>

It is nevertheless clear that the relationship between “man” and the “nomad” mirrors the relation of the anti-Semite to the Jew, as the “nomad” is presented as tied to technology and as such represents a threat to “man.” At the same time that it generalizes Lévinas's text, the opening of Blanchot's essay nonetheless manages to parallel the first paragraph of Lévinas's, even alluding obliquely to Heidegger's critique of flight in “Das Ding.” Within the body of the essay, Blanchot does take up specifically the category of the pagan, declaring that Gagarin's space flight is a threat to the pagan in all of us: he who is tied to enrootedness, to tradition, to his biological race, he who consoles himself among the trees over the evil of mankind. The Jew, however, is not mentioned. Even when Lévinas is paraphrased in the essay it is without specific citation, and he is referred to not as someone who speaks in the name of Judaism but as “the man with no fixed abode,” as a representative of the nomads (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 269). In repeating Lévinas, Blanchot has insisted on resisting the move back to the proper, which Lévinas's essay performs in its emphasis on Judaism's message. Lévinas uses Gagarin's flight to lead back to the truth of Judaism, concluding his own essay with the claim that, like technology, Judaism “has demystified the universe” and, moreover, “has discovered man in the nudity of the face” (“H,” p. 259; “HGU,” p. 234). Blanchot uses Lévinas's essay to remind us that Gagarin tears us away from the proper in
         every sense. His omission of both Lévinas's name and of Judaism underscores the point that deracination as a moral concept would prohibit reappropriation of any kind. The message of Gagarin's speech from space is for no one to claim and for no one to own, that is, that “truth is nomadic” (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 271). Blanchot has thus doubly displaced Lévinas'~<br>

Abstract: Once again the tense is the present for the actions of the bird, emphasizing its eternal action, while the imperfect is the narrative time for Dante's memory of Beatrice's actions. With the echo of Richard of St. Victor's discussion of birds and contemplation,
         64here Beatrice becomes the nonhuman creature, a bird, pregnant with love, waiting so she can feed her brood. In eternal animal anticipation and delight, she expects the dawn, an allegorical reference to resurrection and new life, as the bliss of animal being renders this mystical anticipation.<br>

Abstract: If we wish to express the principle of temporality in
         Ulyssesin terms of a formal concept, we could say with Augustine: within the continuous flux of unarticulated consciousness, everything is only to the extent that it is present; the past aspraesens de praeteritis[the present of the past], the present aspraesens de praesentibus[the present of the present], the future aspraesens de futuris[the present of the future]. All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly: the past without any distance, modified and often also deformed, as a mere mirror; the present in a state of absolute contingency, a-causal and without any specificity (without any reference to a hierarchy of meanings), as mere perception; the future entirely as empty projection, in the mode of expectation, of mere intention or of passive desire, but never in the guise of a causal act of the will that would create a future for itself.

Abstract: Second, what is the relation between practical “reflection” (or decision) and practical reasoning? While no one can choose or avow for me, my reflective avowal must respond to what I take to be reasons, as Larmore’s argument about grounds of commitment contends—and so it cannot “dispense” entirely with reference to others (65). Thus, the authenticity found in practical affirmation or attestation cannot be an experience of complete independence from others (my choice must in principle be intelligible). And so the “irreplaceable nature of each individual life” seen in authentic self-relation (55) cannot be defined negatively as an exclusion of other perspectives: it must instead depend on the energy, effort, or initiative in avowal.<br>

Abstract: This parallel is noted by J. Milgrom (
         Leviticus 1–16, 776), though his interpretation that this term implies either a demonic attack or “contact with the pagan sphere” (following K. Elliger,Leviticus, HAT (Tübingen, 1966], 180) is unwarranted and contradicts his subsequent statement: “In the Bible, God is always the author ofnegaʿ.” In P and D, this term is used exclusively in reference to “leprosy.”<br>

Abstract: Question six raises the issue of whether the cultural systems that Geertz discusses—religion, ideology, aesthetics—are in fact any more systematically coherent than morality, extending this to the methodological relation between spiritual and moral and between spiritual and evil. Crapanzano is correct to identify the anthropological effacement of both spiritual and evil, though one might refer to both as insistent discursive shadows, rather than actual absences. In question seven, I agree that the reification and gothic characterization of evil may blind us to and add power to the rhetoric of evil. This is part of why anthropologists intuitively avoid evil, and precisely why I insist on the thematization rather than the reification of evil, and avoid the gothic characterization of evil to bring in the ethnology of witchcraft instead. Crapanzano’s attribution of evil to demons and devils in question nine plays into such a gothic characterization. In question eight, I am not certain that the identification of structural/symbolic oppositions qualifies me as a dualist in the usual sense, but certainly the specter of dualism that haunts the category of evil supports my argument for a need to rethink the category. This leads directly to the final question about the amoral and moral indifference. Thematizing evil rather than reifying it allows a distinction between saying “I don’t give a damn,” which is in fact a moral stance, and really not giving a damn, which is truly outside morality—this is related to the distinction between a criminal and a sociopath. Finally, Crapanzano’s reference to the bleaker side of human consociation prompts us to reiterate that evil is better examined not for its own sake but as integral to morality. Certainly amorality and moral indifference have moral and cultural consequences.<br>

Abstract: Historiography, too, was part of the larger process. Memory turned into history is traceable in written form from the beginning of the third century BC onward. We have evidence of honorific funerary inscriptions, increasing in scale with the sarcophagi and
         elogiaeto the Scipiones. The earliest known funerary oration (laudatio funebris), which survives in fragmentary form and was presumably a speech recorded in writing, dates from 221 BC; it concerns the twice consul—although this information is absent from the textual fragment—andpontifex maximusL. Caecilius Metellus. Religious data were included in historiography, which took shape in different generic forms, following or modifying Greek models.
               By the middle of the third century BC, the16
            pontifex maximusTiberius Coruncanius began to record pontificalcommentarii, protocols of changes in memberships, prodigies observed, decisions taken. Ascription of agency to actors, and hence the situating of specific priesthoods within a network of ever more formalized and differentiated authorities, seems to have been the dominant function. Thus we know that in 275 or 274 BC Lucius Postumius Albinus was the priest called therex sacrorum.
               In that capacity he witnessed the introduction of a new divinatory practice: the17
            haruspicesstarted to pay attention to the heart of the sacrificial victim in their scrutiny of entrails.
               Evidently, reference to the office of the18
            rex sacrorumhad been used as a form of dating, supplemented by Olympiads, in the underlying source.<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>

Abstract: In the traditional model of a universe that is metaphysically grounded in a supernatural world, the intervention of grace occurs when the transcendent reality impinges on our own. Even though grace thus comprehended may have immanent effects, it has, nonetheless, a supernatural locus.
            
                  To overcome this difficulty the novel difference produced by grace must be thinkable as a difference proper to immanence itself.66
               
                  Drawing on the reflection of Paul, Jean-Luc Marion, and Alain Badiou, Miller argues that “it is possible to think grace as an immanent novelty that is actually infinite, that is to think it in terms of both immanence and actuality.” The reason why Paul’s writings break ground for the thought of an immanent grace is that the resurrection of Jesus puts Paul in a peculiar conceptual position: he is forced to think about grace given the fact that the Messiah has already come and actually accomplished our redemption. “Though Paul’s thought does not proceed without reference to a supernatural order beyond our own, he still must account for how God’s grace can be both immanent (it is already here) and actually given (it is not simply latently potential)—all despite the fact that the world has not ended but continues on as if nothing has happened.”67
               
                  Badiou follows in Paul’s steps, as it were, freeing his “theory of truth” from unnecessary reference to transcendence.68<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: The final chapter, which considers the
      Lex Mercatoria(1622) of the merchant Gerrard de Malynes, can stand for what is most distinctive about Anderson’s book. Like all that precedes it, it is the product of equal parts intense close reading and deep research. (The endnotes, fully a third again of the book’s length and set in smaller type, are a rich mine both of reference and reflection.) She unfolds Malynes’s body-soul-and-spirit allegory of “the three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke” (177) — commodities, money, and exchange — in order to show how he argues for the overriding economic importance of monetary policy. Malynes has his critics, both on account of his metaphors (which were disparaged by contemporaries such as Thomas Mun) and his theory (Mun again, and most modern economists). What Anderson is ultimately concerned to show, however, is how, for all of the potential intricacy of the relations between body and exchange, Malynes’s conceit is sterile, never transforming or vitalizing what I. A. Richards would call its economic tenor. His book had little power to change the way his contemporaries talked about money. Critics mostly celebrate the discovery of metaphorical overplus: here is a valuable lesson in how metaphor might fail.<br>

Abstract: Maybeck was accused of uncritical use of various elements found in d'Espouy's album (see Cardwell,
               Bernard Maybeck, 146). A number of his tracings as well as the design of vases show that d'Espouy was indeed a major source of his reference. I believe that d'Espouy's renderings of the Temple of Mars Ultor was among Maybeck's prototypes because of a surviving drawing showing a very close tracing of d'Espouy's original. The drawing could be seen on the website of Online Archive of California, Maybeck Collection,http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf7h4nb2zp/?brand=oac4(accessed 29 June 2010).<br>

Abstract: Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market" (1862) has garnered seemingly limitless critical interpretation — the goblins' remarkable fruit inviting allegorical readings of the poem that reference, most popularly, Christianity, sexuality, and capitalism. In this essay I read fruit simply as food, situating the poem within the context of food adulteration contemporary with its 1859 composition. Food adulteration was a widespread problem in Victorian England, as increasing numbers of merchants cut flour with alum, doctored curry with mercury, and enhanced the appearance of potted fruits and vegetables with copper and lead. Public alarm regarding this form of fraud reached its height in the 1850s, largely due to the work of an independent Analytical Sanitary Commission, which published its findings in
         The Lancetbetween 1851 and 1854. While Parliament responded to these reports with the formation of a Select Committee in 1855, the popular press responded with articles, tracts, and ballads addressing this pandemic problem. Manuals that instructed consumers how to protect themselves by acquiring the accoutrements of home laboratories proliferated, as did references to adulteration in popular literature. In this essay I read Rossetti's poem as an example of this type of reference. The market of the poem's title, I argue, references a literally contaminated marketplace in which the numbers of people who ate ostensibly nutritious food, only to wither and die in consequence, provoked both governmental and popular alarm.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263715<br>
Date: 3 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Windisch William A.<br>
Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Author(s): Wheelwright Eugene F.<br>
Abstract: Since the language of political inquiry seems to be inescapably metaphorical, the question necessarily arises as to how metaphors of various types, including models, enter into the composition and expression of political knowledge. The solutions that have been most influential in contemporary political science can be called the verificationist and constitutivist views of political metaphor. While both views contain important elements of truth, there are fundamental difficulties in each that require the search for a more satisfactory view. An alternative view of metaphor and political knowledge is developed by reference to four main problems: Why is political speech metaphorical? How do metaphors make political things manifest? How are political metaphors tested? and Are metaphors indispensable to political expression and political knowledge?<br>

Abstract: Rawls's recent modification of his theory of justice claims that political liberalism is free-standing and "falls under the category of the political. It works entirely within that domain and does not rely on anything outside it." In this article I pursue the metatheoretical goal of obtaining insight into the anthropological assumptions that have remained so far unacknowledged by Rawls and critics alike. My argument is that political liberalism has a dependence on comprehensive liberalism and its conception of a self-serving subjectivity that is far more binding as well as undesirable than it has been so far acknowledged. I proceed with a heuristic approach that introduces us to the possibility that political liberalism presupposes tacitly the Occidental metanarrative of reason harnessing rampant self-interest and subordinating it to a higher-order interest. As the presuppositions of political liberalism emerge, I draw from the debate between Rawls and Habermas in order to illustrate my argument for the existence of a dependence on these presuppositions. I outline some implications of the anthropological basis of political liberalism and conclude by exemplifying them with reference to Rawls's comments on the division of a cake.<br>

Abstract: Francisco Ayala's creative dimension gives his literary criticism and theory an immediacy and relevancy both absent from and obscured by the academic emphases of the Theoretical Era. Since Ayala spent more than twenty years teaching in colleges and universities of the United States, including the theoretically-oriented University of Chicago, his Hispanic-tradition theory and criticism is contextualized by reference to Chicago School contemporaries and contrasted with Theoretical Era tendencies.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20099867<br>
Date: 6 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Bird Robert<br>
Abstract: Aleksej Losev's definition of myth centres on the concept of detachment. In modern times detachment has most often figured in the context of philosophical aesthetics, where it is a cognitive category akin to Kant's "disinterestedness" or the Russian formalists' "estrangement." However Losev's usage also makes reference to the ontological sense of detachment as contemplative ascent (cf. Meister Eckhardt's "Abgeschiedenheit"). Thus, Losev's concept of myth combines both senses of detachment, binding perceptual attitude and being together in a double movement of resignation from the world and union with meaning; this movement literally makes sense out of reality. It therefore bears comparison to the treatment of distanciation in contemporary hermeneutics, where detachment is a key condition of understanding. By investigating Losev's connections to other Russian thinkers, the author makes a case for a distinct Russian tradition of hermeneutic philosophy (V. Ivanov, G. Shpet, A. Bakshy, A. Losev).<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i20108002<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Prendeville Brendan<br>
Abstract: Painting is a mute art, abstract painting conspicuously so; how might its meanings be constituted in acts of painting and looking, respectively, without explicit and articulate guidance, always assuming that such meanings are not arbitrary? How might we identify these meanings, other than through 'reading' or decoding? Agnes Martin's work of the New York years suggests particular ways of answering such questions. Crucial factors are: the practical rather than axiomatic or geometric character of Martin's grids; the perceptual instability of her work; the 'dissonance' between rectangle and square, field and frame; the bodily address of the work; Martin's aspiration to make a new American art. Circumstantially important are the close friendships among the artists at Coenties Slip, as interpreted in photographs by Hans Namuth, and the marginal and temporary status of the loft community, set in the shadow of Wall Street, as viewed in the context of urban development. The argument is that the ethos of friendship and temporary community was particularly important in the formation of Martin's work, and helps in understanding the terms of our encounter with it. Here it is essential to recogn3ize the difference in historical situation between painter and viewer -- these indeed being works in respect to which situatedness is acutely felt. The argument is sustained with reference to: the phenomenology of embodied perception and tacit understanding (Todes and Merleau-Ponty); the dialectic between self-definition and subjection to power (Foucault); Gertrude Stein's modernism and "The Making of Americans".<br>

Abstract: In this introduction to a selection of case studies on the theme "the past in music" I offer a few thoughts on the nature of the past and the role of memory in constructing historical narrative, with reference to the way in which these concepts have been theorized by historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and ethnomusicologists. In reviewing the different ways in which echoes of the past can still be heard in the music of the present, I consider the capacity of music to evoke, embody and transform the past and, by so doing, to act as a medium for history and its interpretation.<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i20184615<br>
Date: 11 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Iguchi Kawori<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Issue: i210419<br>
Date: 7 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Klausner Samuel Z.<br>
Abstract: The ways in which values are assimilated to social research differ according to the theoretical frame of reference informing the research. An example from the writings of E. Digby Baltzell illustrates how a moral commitment shaped his assumptions about the nature of the social matrix and his research strategies. A Western moral rhetoric fares well if the researcher chooses a methodologically individualist framework. The framework assists a moral rhetoric by providing it with concrete rather than abstract social actors and with a basis for explanation in terms of motive rather than situational forces. Along the way moral statements can appear in the form of empirical generalizations and historical laws. Should sociologists deem ethically neutral social research desirable, this study suggests that concentration on scientific method, without exploring the value bases for selecting a frame of reference, is not a promising approach. A value analysis, especially around Weber's "value relevance," may function propaedeuticly.<br>

Issue: i210405<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Hall John R.<br>
Abstract: Conventionally, proposals to improve working relations between sociology and history have been interdisciplinary. The present essay advances an alternative approach-consolidation of sociohistorical inquiry as a transdisciplinary enterprise. All socio-historical inquiry depends on four elemental forms of discourse: discourse on values, narrative discourse, social theoretical discourse, and the discourse of explanation. Though inquiry is transdisciplinary in the problematics of these discourses, concrete methodology typically is oriented either toward theorization in relation to cases (historical sociology) or toward comprehensive analysis of a single phenomenon (sociological history). Varying the articulated relations among the four forms of discourse once for historical sociology and again for sociological history yields eight ideal typical strategies of inquiry. The four strategies of historical sociology include universal history, theory application, macro-analytic history, and contrast-oriented comparison. The parallel strategies for sociological history are situational history, specific history, configurational history, and historicism. These ideal types offer standard reference points that help clarify the underpinnings of a diverse range of scholarly practices.<br>

Abstract: Although the Thai-Lao peasants living in rain-fed agricultural communities in northeastern Thailand have experienced some improvements in their socioeconomic situation as a consequence of the growth of the Thai economy since the mid-1950s, these peasants still constitute the poorest sector of the population of Thailand. Moreover, the socioeconomic position of the rural northeastern Thai populace has actually declined relative to that of the urban populace and that of the rural populace living in central Thailand. The economic disadvantageous position of Thai-Lao peasants is linked with a sense of being an ethnoregional minority within a polity that has been highly centralized since reforms instituted at the end of the nineteenth century. Much of the social action of Thai-Lao peasants with reference to the political-economic constraints on their world can be understood, as long-term research in one community reveals, as having been impelled by rational calculation aimed at improving the well being of peasant families. The ways in which peasants have assessed in practice the justice of these constraints as well as the ways in which they have assessed the limits to entrepreneurship must be seen, however, as being rooted in moral premises that Thai-Lao villagers have appropriated from Theravada Buddhism as known to them in their popular culture.<br>

Abstract: Depuis les années 1980, la littérature de voyage a retenu l'intérêt des historiens et des littératures. Mais quels regards ont-ils portés sur le statut générique de ces textes? Plus précisément, comment ont-ils envisagé les relations entre récit de voyage et fiction? Des différentes approches proposées, que l'on comprendra ici dans une évolution des paradigmes en sciences humaines, on retiendra la méfiance générale sur le genre viatique et le monolithisme théorique, témoins d'une définition insuffisante du récit de voyage. Le présent article, faisant appel aux récents débats autour du statut ontologique et anthropologique de la fiction, cherche à distinguer, sur la base d'un corpus de récits de voyage circonstancié (le voyage français au Tibet au tournant du XXe siècle), la diversité des phénomènes fictionnels au sein du récit de voyage, au loin d'une conception figée de leurs relations. Si les définitions « locales » et les usages multiples de la fiction plaident pour un traitement au cas par cas, il ressort également de l'analyse que, dans le contexte propre à la situation interculturelle que présente le récit de voyage, la fiction demande à être envisagée dans ses vertus heuristiques. Since the 1980s, travel literature has attracted the interest of historians and students of literature. What view have they adopted of the generic status of such texts? How have they conceived of the relation between travel accounts and fiction? In the different approaches proposed (understood herein as a shift in the paradigms of human sciences), we notice a general mistrust of travel narratives and a « theoretical monolithism », this being evidence of an inadequate definition of the genre. A reference to recent debates about fiction's ontological and anthropological status serves to discern the diversity of fictional phenomena in a corpus of detailed French accounts of travels in Tibet at the turn of the 20th century. The « local » definitions and multiple uses of fiction call for~<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of interpreting the concepts of tradition and traditionalism with specific reference to the tradition of the Anatolian house and the recent erosion of place quality in Turkish towns. The Anatolian house provides a remarkable example of cultural diffusion and transformation. During the reign of the late Ottoman, a variety of cultures impinged on one another, giving rise to autochthonous traditions that were shared by different religious and ethnic groups. But during the Republican Period the process of Westernization interrupted the continuity of historic traditions, resulting in the emergence of a peculiar contemporary tradition. The majority of Turkish housing today displays characteristics of a "vernacular modernism" conditioned by the moral and technical orders of a market economy. The worldwide spread of such cultural mediocrity has often been attributed to the corrosive influence of a single world civilization. A number of recent attempts have been made to search for a national idiom in Turkey. But these attempts, often promoting a "vernacular historicism," have yet to account for any distinct revision of urban house-form. Argument today revolves around an old rhetorical opposition between universal civilization and national culture. Should a post-traditional society sustain its cultural tradition to attain universal values, or vice-versa? The conservative in this debate is more involved in the revival than in the preservation of tradition. The progressive, though an ardent defender of preservation, resists revivalism because of its chauvinistic connotations and pastiche effects. This paper attempts to resolve this argument by suggesting a simultaneous unfolding of the historical problems of the Anatolian house tradition and the theoretical problems of presumed dichotomies such as "traditional vs. modern." Finally, the paper advocates the development of research strategies to facilitate correct readings of cultural tradition and~<br>

Abstract: Freud's metapsychology, although it is not identical with the whole field of psychoanalytic psychology, originated under the controlling influence of a questionable positivistic model of science. The analysis begun in a previous study (Gregorianum, 61 [1980] 97-136) continues in this study of the relationship in Freud's thought between theory and empirical observation. We also treat the attempts by Freud and by the later neopositivist schools of classical ego-theory to articulate psychoanalytic insights about the person in terms taken from neurophysiology, biology, and classical mechanics. Such terms pervade the terminology used to express the metapsychological viewpoints, albeit in disharmonious juxtaposition with more specifically psychological terms. Freud's whole work was affected by his desire to propose psychoanalysis as a natural science on the model of the positivistic outlook of late nineteenth century Viennese physicalism. Opposition arose in the 1950s and 1960s to understanding psychoanalysis as a natural science, especially because of problems of conceptual definition, language, and verification or validation. Orthodox Freudians themselves were troubled by the problem of psychic energy and the discussion finally led to critical doubts about Freud's whole metapsychology. One reason was the dependence on a physical and mechanical model of science and on a neurophysiology no longer tenable. Other frames of reference in the exact sciences were sought, such as cybernetics and information theory, in an attempt to remain to some extent in harmony with the original epistemological ideology. There are those today who remain convinced that psychoanalysis is an exact science, and who in turn reject the different psychologies of understanding and the hermeneutical sciences. In the context of a basic-level discussion, this contribution explores, in their context, the principles of the worldview found at the most theoretical level of metapsychology. Among these, the p~<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: Nel complesso terreno della filosofia contemporanea, Hannah Arendt e Maurice Blondel si distinguono per aver posto entrambi l'azione al centro della propria riflessione. Il confronto delle loro posizioni filosofiche è facilitato dal comune e costante riferimento ad Aristotele, particolarmente alle sue indagini sulla praxis. Più in particolare, entrambi citano e commentano Ethica Nicomachea IX 7, ove Aristotele discute dei rapporti tra benefattore e beneficato. Mentre la Arendt sfrutta questo testo per mostrare come Aristotele abbia svalutato la praxis confondendola con la poiesis, Blondel ne trae spunto per una fenomenologia dell'opera che trova nell'amico la sua inafferrabile perfezione. Within contemporary philosophy, both Hannah Arendt and Maurice Blondel are distinguished for situating action at the centre of their reflection. Investigation of their philosophical positions is facilitated by their common and constant reference to Aristotle, especially his findings on praxis. More particularly, both cite and comment on Nicomachean Ethics IX 7, where Aristotle discusses the relationship between benefactor and beneficiary. While Arendt uses the text to show how Aristotle undervalued praxis, through confusing it with poiesis, Blondel exploits the passage for his phenomenology of action, which finds its elusive perfection in a friend.<br>

Abstract: Rosenzweig e Levinas pensano la Rivelazione di Dio nella storia richiamandosi su diversi aspetti, anche se con sottolineature specifiche. Per la tradizione ebraica il problema di Dio e della possibilità della sua rivelazione è di sapere come Egli agisca nei confronti dell'uomo. Per Rosenzweig, il riferimento alla vita vissuta apre la possibilità di un pensiero nuovo, dove il tempo diventa l'altro del soggetto. Allo stesso modo, per Levinas il soggetto e il suo potere richiamano, nell'incontro con l'altro, ad un Altro. Entrambi gli autori mettono quindi in risalto la centralità della chiamata dell'uomo all'obbedienza. Per Rosenzweig però, la Rivelazione di Dio è legata al comandamento dell'amore del prossimo, che è legato all'amore di Dio. Per Levinas invece, il rapporto con Dio si riduce al suo aver donato la legge agli uomini. Rosenzweig and Levinas reflect on the revelation of God in history drawing on different aspects of the question and offering different emphases. In both of these authors we recognize how it is central to Jewish tradition to reflect on the problem of God and on the possibility of his revelation by reflecting on the question of just how it is that he acts towards man. For Rosenzweig, a reference to life as lived opens the possibility of a new way of thinking where time becomes the 'other' that confronts the subject. Similarly, for Levinas the ability that the subject has to recall an encounter with the 'other' enables an openness to an encounter with the 'Other'. In each of these authors we witness a stress on man's call to obedience. However, for Rosenzweig, the revelation of God is linked to the commandment of love of one's neighbor, which is tied to God's love for us; for Levinas the relationship with God is reduced to his having given the law to men.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo consiste numa análise da noção zubiriana de mentalidade. Começa por descrever a razão como busca para descobrir a estrutura da realidade. Esta busca requer um método que inclua um sistema de referência, que é o seu ponto de partida no sentido de sugerir hipóteses e teorias que expliquem a realidade. O sistema de referência deriva da transformação do campo de realidade. Esta transformação, que não segue uma via única, depende da "mentalidade" dos que procuram a realidade profunda. Em Zubiri, o conceito de "mentalidade" é polissémico. Existe uma "mentalidade estrutural e intrínseca", uma "mentalidade situacional extrínseca" e um "horizonte mental". Neste artigo estudam-se as três mentalidades e a sua relevância na constituição do sistema de referência e na elaboração de hipóteses e teorias. Finalmente, o artigo analisa a relevância destas mentalidades para compreender os contributos da investigação interdisciplinar e os seus desafios. The following paper is an analysis of Zubiri's notion of mentality. It starts by describing reason as a quest to uncover the structure of reality. This quest requires a method that includes a system of reference, which is its point of departure in the sense of suggesting hypotheses and theories that explain reality. The system of reference results from a transformation of the field of reality. This transformation, which does not follow a unique path, depends on the "mentality" of those who seek to deepen reality. In Zubiri the concept "mentality" is polysemic. There is a "structural and intrinsic mentality", an "extrinsic situational mentality" and a "mental horizon". The three of them and their relevance in the constitution of the system of reference and the elaboration of hypotheses and theories are studied. Finally the paper analyzes the relevance of these mentalities to understand the contributions of interdisciplinary research and its challenges.<br>

Abstract: Nos inúmeros estudos sobre a natureza humana, a referência à deficiência intelectual é muito escassa. No entanto, assumi-la, além de acabar com uma marginalização injusta, poderia ensinar-nos muito. Com esta convicção, neste estudo analisa-se como essas pessoas são colocadas nas várias teorias sobre o ser humano e como, por sua vez, essas teorias são interpeladas por elas. Depois de propor um mapa das concepções mais influentes da natureza humana, estuda-se o lugar das pessoas com deficiência em propostas que destacam como chaves estes traços do humano: a subjectividade moral da dignidade, a linguagem e o pensamento, a natureza (animal), a cultura. Como resultado desta análise conclui-se a necessidade de repensar estas concepções, tanto a partir de critérios estritamente cognitivos como éticos. There is almost no reference to intellectual disability in the many studies about human nature. The incorporation of intellectual disability into those studies would help to overcome the unfair marginalization of affected people and would provide us with important insights into the human nature. This study examines the place of intellectually disable people in diverse philosophical anthropologies and how the incorporation of this human condition challenges them. After mapping the most influential conceptions of human nature, the paper reviews how intellectually disabled people are taken into account in theories that highlight the following key human features: moral subjectivity of dignity, language and thought, (animal) nature, culture. The study concludes that taking into account intellectual disability provides cognitive and moral reasons for rethinking current conceptions of the human nature.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur connects the philosophical concept of 'recognition' to the ethnological analysis of ceremonial gift exchange by focusing on the term 'gratitude'. Particularly by means of a content analysis of the French word 'reconnaissance' (recognition) Ricoeur demonstrates that the term 'reconnaissance' is closely linked with the notion of gratitude. Thus Ricoeur broadens the philosophical concept of 'recognition', that is mainly defined in reference to the influential idea of an endless 'struggle for recognition' (Kampf um Anerkennung) as Friedrich Hegel puts it. Ricoeur outlines the interesting idea that gratitude binds donor and recipient together and that the ceremonial gift exchange symbolises the mutual recognition of donor and recipient. Hence the experience of the gift should be understood as the experience of being recognised. I wish to pursue these considerations by arguing that the gift exchange can only then be considered as establishing a mutual recognition if the gift itself is also recognised and acknowledged as such. As Marcel Mauss demonstrated this is the case in traditional societies.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of narrative as a basic linguistic form in communication. It is suggested that what clients say, and the case histories that emerge, can be understood in terms of 'fictional' genres. Reference is made to their role in the construction of social work accounts. The author indicates the complex nature of description, the need for increased sensitivity to different kinds of descriptive account and to the part of language and imagination in the making of accounts.<br>

Abstract: Objective: Traumatic memories are characterized by not being accessible to intentional recall nor being integrated into the matrix of autobiographical memory. Based on this description, the authors discuss the process of narration as a central means of regaining a sense of self-coherence after traumatic experiences. Formally correct narratives are characterized by three functions: orientation, reference and evaluation. Through so-called "memory talk" with socio-culturally competent partners, children learn how to reconstruct memories and to represent experience by narration. It is therefore suggested that narratives are the basic ingredient of autobiographical memory. The process of re-establishing a sense of coherence after trauma relies on the capacity for coherent narration. The latter is often not possible with traumatic experiences. Method and Result: We conducted a literature search in multiple databases for linguistic analyses of trauma narratives empirically correlating narrative style and posttraumatic psychopathology. Discussion: It is recommended that research in psychopathology and psychotherapy should take issues of language into account more systematically. Fragestellung: Ein zentrales Merkmal traumatischer Erfahrungen besteht darin, dass sie nicht als episodisch strukturierte, bewusstseinsfähige und erzählbare Erinnerungen in das autobiographische Gedächtnis integriert sind. Hiervon ausgehend wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit diskutiert, inwiefern der Prozess der Narrativierung als eine integrative Funktion der Gedächtnisrepräsentation aufgefasst werden kann. Dabei wird das narrative Format als zentraler „Baustein“ des autobiographischen Gedächtnisses postuliert. Kohärente Narrative sind durch drei Funktionen gekennzeichnet: Orientierung, Referenz und Evaluation. Diese werden in der Sprachentwicklung durch „memory talk“ mit soziokulturell kompetenten Partnern erworben. Mit der Überführung autobiographischer Erfahrungen in ein kohärentes Narrativ kann Se~<br>

Article Title: "Money is the Filial Child. But, at the same time, it is also the Enemy!": Korean Shamanic Rituals for Luck and Fortune<br>
Publisher: Institute for the Study of Religion<br>
Issue: i23942764<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Park Jun Hwan<br>
Abstract: In the world of Korean shamanism, there is a particular god, called taegam, which is allegedly famous for its love of money and its abundance of greed for material wealth. During the shamanic ritual of chaesu-kut, the rites for good fortune and luck, this god is popularly worshipped as the Deity of Wealth and is typically symbolized by money placed all over its face and spirit costumes. Nonetheless, as money has the two sides of heads and tails, taegam also has two very different faces—so-taegam and taegam. This article explores the ambiguity of the two taegam gods, focusing on the symbolic action of money-offerings and how its meaning is taken from the perspective of the ritual actors, in the hope of shedding light on the place of Korea's traditional popular religion of shamanism in today's transformed urban landscape. By discussing the semantics of "money is the filial child" (a remark made by so-taegam) and "money is the enemy" (as remarked by taegam), statements I often heard during my fieldwork in Seoul, I suggest that the ambivalent symbolic nature of taegam should be seen as an indispensible vehicle for understanding ritual life, as well as everyday life, of urban Korean people since it is closely related to both normative orientations and the contradictory aspects of the material culture of contemporary urbanites inhabiting the borderless, globalized, and fluctuating modern capitalist market. This conclusion is reached partly with reference to existing sociological theories of money and anthropological inquiries into the ambivalent aspects of taegam.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2015<br>
Author(s): Weiland Marc<br>
Abstract: This paper analyzes the different types of narrative self-reference employed in the autobiographical works of Felicitas Hoppe and Péter Esterházy. It argues that these texts illustrate and reflect an anthropological condition which can be described as ›eccentric positionality‹, a term coined by Helmuth Plessner, or ›constitutive homelessness‹. Self-narrating is both the expression of and compensation for that condition. According to Paul Ricœur it can be seen as an attempt to understand what is essentially indefinable: the individual self. Narrative configurations place different events, actions and perceptions in a (mostly) coherent order. By doing so, they configure the individual self as a being that changes in time. The novels by Hoppe and Esterházy display and simulate different modes of self-narrating between historicization and fictionalization, namely self-discovery (Selbstfindung), self-invention (Selbsterfindung), and self-determination (Selbstbestimmung). As these modes are confronted with different types of problems, they reflect the complex relationship of a person to herself as both the narrator and the protagonist of her life story.<br>

Abstract: The ledger's collocation is ASV, Avogaria di Comun, 'Balla d'Oro', Reg. 162. In their studies of
the Serrata, Lane and Rösch state that lists of applicants for admission to the Greater Council man-
dated in a law of 1315 constituted rosters of the nobility, and as such were forerunners of the Libri
d'Oro begun in 1506. Crouzet Pavan, following the older interpretation of Maranini, makes a similar
statement. However, the requirement of the 1315 law, which is reproduced verbatim by Rösch, ap-
plied not to men actually admitted to the Greater Council but only to applicants; its purpose was to
provide the electors, who in 1315 still chose Council members, with a record of each year's self-
nominees to which they could refer during their secret deliberations. The lists, which have not sur-
vived, therefore did not constitute a record of the nobility's membership but only of men who aspired
to it. See Rösch, Der venezianische Adel, 178-9; Lane, 'The enlargement of the Great Council', 258;

Abstract: Although Ricoeur and Taylor are often grouped together, their conceptions of language, literature, and practical reason are very different. The first half of this essay focuses on Ricoeur's theory of triple mimesis and narrative, showing how his attempt to synthesize Kant, Husserl, and structuralism results in a formalism that blocks out the ontological, hermeneutical, and historical dimensions of literature and practical reason. The second half of the essay develops Taylor's ontological conception of public imagination and illustrates the dynamics of this conception of language and interpretation by showing how literary works debate with each other over language, subjectivity, and reference. Narrative does not just order; it argues.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire quantitative aujourd'hui n'est plus à la mode. Pendant une génération, aux lendemains de la seconde guerre mondiale, elle a constitué pour les historiens français une pratique dominante, et la référence par rapport à laquelle furent longtemps jaugées les manières de faire de l'histoire. La tendance aujourd'hui s'est inversée. Le doute s'est répandu quant à la capacité du chiffre à rendre compte des compartements les plus fondamentaux. En examinant certaines manières de faire de l'histoire quantitative toujours fructueuses et en se gardant de certaines impasses, on cherche à montrer que la démonstration historique ne peut se ramener ni à une logique de la persuasion, ni à une logique de la narration. Les critères de sa pertinence doivent s'apprécier à l'articulation de la définition d'une problématique, des modalités de sa mise en oeuvre expérimentale, et de la confrontation au démenti des données empiriques des propositions historiques. Quantitative history is no longer in fashion. For a generation after the Second World War, it was the usual practice for French historians and the reference for judging work in history. This frame of trend has now been reversed. Doubt has spread concerning the capacity of numbers to explain the most important behaviours. While taking in consideration different styles of research in quantitative history which are always fruitful, and being aware of certain kinds of types of deadlocks, one wants to show how historic demonstration must never be pure persuasion nor pure story. The criteria of its pertinency must be appreciated adequately between the definition of problematic and of testing ground, and in confrontation between empirical data and historical assertions.<br>

Abstract: Cf. George Steiner, A/ter Babel, Aspects of Language and Translation (Oxford Univer-
sity Press, 1975), for perhaps the best comparative analysis of state-of-the-art in translation
theory. George Steiner himself seems to prefer a special sort of interlinear literalist
option (but not 'a word-for-word' transference) that has the translator remain selflessly
submerged within the original tongue, producing a centaur idiom in which one's own
longue takes on a 'deliberate strangeness', and the product becomes virtually an unknown
tongue 'which can transcend the constraints of imprécise objective reference' (pp.307-33).
Steiner approves of Hölderlin's approach, and crédits Chesteron on Du Bellay and Leyris
on Hopkins as superb approximations of the true translation (pp.407-13).<br>

Abstract: Kearny (2007, 198) refers to the idea of zimzum (tzimtzum) in Jewish kabbalistic

pursue this link, see Dalton (2006). For parallel influences, see the 'theology' of the Frankfurt
School: contractio Dei was the topic of Habermas's doctoral dissertation; the theme is also very
much present in Hansjonas's theology: see Valk (2009).<br>

Abstract: Fieldwork is sometimes marked by experiences of frictions and frustration. Fieldwork with mobile street vendors in an African city may confront the fieldworker with the problem of locating the 'field' and attaining access to it, both spatially and temporally. As I will show by reference to my fieldwork with a group of shoe vendors on the streets of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the frictions that occurred at the beginning of my fieldwork nevertheless ignited a process of ethnographic knowledge-gaining that led me to understand the importance of temporality and rhythmicity for the shoe vendors' practices. In their active engagement with the spatio-temporal landscape of the city, the street vendors organised their practices as an experiential rhythm that unfolded as sequences of rising and subsequently declining cognitive and corporeal tensions. These rhythms did not flow smoothly, but were necessarily interspersed with disturbances and frictions by the rhythms of other pedestrians in the streets, whose attention the street vendors tried to attain.<br>

Abstract: These generalizations can be supported by reference to a vast literature, but I particu-
larly recommend two of Christopher Thome's last books, Border Crossings; and The Issue of War:
States, Societies, and the Far Eastern Conflict (London, 1985). The opening pages of Thomas G.
Paterson's On Every Front: The Making of the Cold War (New York, 1979) still provide a wonder-
ful glimpse of the devastation and dislocation wrought by World War II.<br>

Abstract: While there is much writing on the nation as the subject of linear history, considerably less attention has been paid to the dimension of the nation as the always identifiable, unchanging subject of history. This unchanging subject is necessitated by the ascendancy of the conception of linear time in capitalism in which change is viewed not only as accelerating, but can no longer be framed by an ultimate source of meaning such as God. Ostensibly, linear history is the falling of events into the "river of time," but national history also posits a continuous subject to gather these changes. Such a subject is recognizable only by the spiritual qualities of authenticity, purity, and sacrality. The nation-state and nationalists stake their claim to sovereign authority, in part, as custodians of this authenticity. A range of figures, human and non-human, come to symbolize a regime of authenticity manipulable to some extent by nationalists and state-builders. This essay focuses on the instance of women in early twentieth-century China. Nationalists and cultural essentialists tended to depict women as embodying the eternal Chinese civilizational virtues of self-sacrifice and loyalty and to elevate them as national exemplars. The essay also examines cases of how women themselves may have perceived this role as exemplars and concludes that while there was considerable subversion in their enunciation of this role (to their advantage), there was sufficient reference to the prescriptive code of authenticity in their self-formation to sustain the regime of authenticity. The essay ends with some thoughts about the changing relationship between authenticity and intensifying globalization in the contemporary world.<br>

Article Title: Ankersmit's Postmodernist Historiography: The Hyperbole of "Opacity"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342994<br>
Date: 10 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Mink John H.<br>
Abstract: Ankersmit's articulation of a postmodern theory of history takes seriously both the strengths of traditional historicism and the right of historians to decide what makes sense for disciplinary practice. That makes him an exemplary interlocutor. Ankersmit proposes a theory of historical "representation" which radicalizes the narrative approach to historiography along the lines of poststructuralist textualism. Against this postmodernism but invoking some of his own arguments, I defend the traditional historicist position. I formulate criticisms of the theory of reference entailed in his notion of "narrative substance," of his master analogy of historiography with modern painting, and finally of his characterization of historical hermeneutics. In each case I find him guilty of the hyperbole which he himself cautions against. While it is true that historical narratives cannot be taken to be transparent, in taking them to be opaque Ankersmit puts himself in an untenable position. Finally, Ankersmit seeks to buttress his theoretical case by an interpretation of the new cultural historical texts of authors like Davis and Ginzburg. While this is a concreteness heartily to be welcomed in philosophers of history, I cannot find his construction of this new school's work plausible.<br>

Article Title: Reception Theory and the Interpretation of Historical Meaning<br>
Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342974<br>
Date: 10 1, 1899<br>
Author(s): Bosanquet Martyn P.<br>
Abstract: The paper examines the very different insights of theorists into the interpretation of the historical meaning of literary reception (especially recent German theorists of Rezeptionsgeschichte) and Anglo-American theorists of the "new" history of political thought (especially Quentin Skinner and J. G. A. Pocock). Among the former, readers create meaning; among the latter, authorial intended meanings are fundamental. Both perspectives are valuable, but one-sided. The differences between them arise from different perspectives on the character of a text. But those perspectives are not as incompatible as has been supposed, especially by reception theorists. By examining the incoherences of literary reception theory when viewed from the perspective of the intentionalists, and by examining the one-sidedness of intentionalist theory in the light of a modified version of the reception perspective, it is shown that an understanding of historical meaning requires both insights. The argument is illustrated by reference to the history of political thought, a history which might more usefully be conceived as the history of political literature.<br>

Article Title: The New Annalistic: A Sketch of a Theory of History<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342990<br>
Date: 10 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Nipperdey Lucian<br>
Abstract: This article argues for the establishment of a new, "annalistic" model of history and historical investigation. This implies a new concept of historical event: instead of being seen as an element within a historical narrative, the historical event is defined as the common reference point of many narratives that can be told about it. The annalistic model also implies a new concept of historical change: instead of being defined as the change of an "object" within a set of given historical parameters, historical change has to be perceived as the change of parameters related to a given historical object. A new concept of history follows from the annalistic model: instead of history being a metaphysical unity of space and time (the destiny of mankind, the positivist's world of facts), in which everything is linked to everything, it is instead the product of historical judgment carried out by those who design stories about their own past, present, and future. To the "annalist" a world is imaginable in which no history has existed, exists, or will exist. The article analyzes three aspects of the concept of historical time: it demonstrates the huge variety of temporal structures in history; it argues for the foundation of the representation of historical time in linguistic concepts; and it discusses the relationship of fictionality and reality in historical discourse. Finally, the annalistic model is compared to the traditional concept of history established by historicism in the nineteenth century.<br>

Abstract: Alberto Guerreiro Ramos's intellectual trajectory is analyzed to show his permanent concern with the condition of contemporary humanity. Two moments in his trajectory are specifically addressed. In the first, under the strong influence of Christian intellectual thought, the category of human person was most important to him. In the second moment he sought to demonstrate autonomy from those earlier influences, secularized his thought, and coined the expression Parenthetical Man, which was central to his criticism of the social sciences and especially of organizational theory. From this he proposed his theory of social system delimitation. From this point of view, it is possible to affirm that Guerreiro Ramos's sociology is predominantly antropocentric, in other words, Ramos takes man as the main reference in his design of social systems.<br>

Abstract: Regido por la subjetividad, el universo contemporáneo del creer es en todas sus partes de circulación fluida, inmediatamente refractario a cualquier referencia estructurante a estabilidad alguna, excepto cuando postula esta estabilidad como puramente operatoria. El objetivo del creer contemporáneo no consiste en alcanzar una "identidad religiosa" (que se concibe como "estable"), sino demostrar que puede ser un creer dentro del movimiento. En realidad, el concepto de "religión", como también los de "secularización" y de "laicidad" que se le asocian, pasan a ser, en situación de plena legitimidad social de la individualización radical de la construcción de una relación con el sentido, conceptos cada vez más indeterminados y en consecuencia de sobra inutilizables, al menos mientras se persista en reconocerles una pertinencia que les sería propia. La "religión", por ello, no es sino el indicador de recomposiciones más amplias, en las cuales participa, por otra parte, como instrumento de gestión. Así, sólo tiene sentido como objeto de intermediación, un analizador que, contextualizado, puede por lo demás resultar muy precioso. /// Ruled by subjectivity, the contemporary universe of belief is in all its parts of fluid circulation, immediately impervious to any structuring reference to any stability, unless this stability is posited as a purely operating principle. The aim of contemporary belief is not to achieve a "religious identity" (which would be conceived as "stable"), but to show that it can be a belief within movement. In fact, the concept of "religion", as well as the related concepts of "secularization" and "laicism" that are associated to it, happen to become, in a situation of total social legitimacy of radical individualization in constructing a relation with meaning, increasingly indeterminate and consequently utterly useless concepts, at least as far as there persists the will to grant them a pertinence of their own. "Religion", for that reason, is nothing m~<br>

Abstract: Social scientists who study peasant groups in Brazil have come across some unfamiliar expressions. In searching for an explanatory analogical key which would make a translation possible, economic and political referents have commonly been used. The author argues that one must take seriously the existence of a 'biblical culture' that cannot be simply reduced to other codes. This is illustrated by the notion of captivity which has usually been taken as refering to authoritarianism, capitalism, expropriation, proletarianization, etc. The author suggests that although contextually all this may be true, the main reference has to do with what Paul Ricoeur has termed the symbolism of evil. Empirical material drawn from his own and other social scientists' researches in the Amazon is used to illustrate this possibility, which seems to bear significant theoretical and political consequences. Symbolism, the notion of text as regards the relation between cultural phenomenon and social conditions, the relation between autonomy and dependence, different notions of time and history are some of the themes that come up either as new perspectives regarding old issues or as subproducts of this line of reasoning. Los científicos sociales que estudian grupos campesinos en Brasil han descubierto expresiones poco usuales para ellos. Buscando una clave explicativa analógica que hiciera posible una traducción, se han usado generalmente ciertos referentes de naturaleza económica y política. El autor argumenta que es necesario tomar en serio la existencia de una 'cultura bíblica,' que no puede ser simplemente reducida a otro código. Eso se ilustra con la noción de cautiverio, que normalmente se entiende como referencia al autoritarismo, al capitalismo, a la expropiación, a la proletarización, etc. El autor sugiere que, aunque todo eso pueda ser verdad contextualmente, la referencia principal tiene que ver con lo que Paul Ricoeur denominara simbolismo del mal, lo que a su vez se articula con ~<br>

Abstract: Twelve years after the genocide, nothing has been forgotten in Rwanda. The country resembles a multiplicity of experiences, words and silences. The aim of the article is to reflect on the representations – or absence of representations – of the past. The approach is based on the ambivalence of any reference to the past. It is not a question of making a judgement in the abstract about the more or less legitimate character of the attitudes observed, but to understand the dynamics at work. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part recalls the specific aspects of the case under study. The second examines the silences that weigh upon Rwandan society. The third notes the main accounts of the past.<br>

Abstract: According to recent analyses, we are said to be witnessing in the West a « naturalisation » of filiation. The present article challenges this hypothesis, based on anthropological and historical analyses of old “parallel” kinships and the new forms of family configurations. It recalls the longstanding reference to nature in the representations and uses of kinship and the existence of a metaphorical and symbolic world characterised both in the past and today by the plurality of meanings given to kinship relations.<br>

Abstract: How can we conduct cross-cultural inquiry without reproducting the ethnocentric categories that prompt critique in the first place? Postcolonial and comparative political theorists have called into question the "universal" applicability of Western liberal political norms, but their critiques are drawn most often from competing Western discourses (e.g., poststructuralism) rather than from the culturally diverse traditions of scholarship whose ideas they examine. In contrast, I suggest attending to these culturally situated traditions of scholarship, especially their methods of inquiry, in addition to their substantive ideas. This method-centered approach reinterprets cross-cultural engagement, not as a tool for modifying existing parochial debates on the basis of "non-Western" cases, but as an opportunity to ask new questions through alternative frames of reference. Examining the interpretive methodologies of two classicists, I show how their methods offer not only new ideas but also new methods for the practice of political and cross-cultural theory.<br>

Author(s): DiCenso James<br>
Abstract: This paper engages Freud's relation to Kant, with specific reference to each theorist's articulation of the interconnections between ethics and religion. I argue that there is in fact a constructive approach to ethics and religion in Freud's thought, and that this approach can be better understood by examining it in relation to Kant's formulations on these topics. Freud's thinking about religion and ethics participates in the Enlightenment heritage, with its emphasis on autonomy and rationality, of which Kant's model of practical reason is in many ways exemplary. At the same time, Freud advances Kantian thinking in certain important respects; his work offers a more somatically, socially, and historically grounded approach to the formation of rational and ethical capacities, and hence makes it more compatible with contemporary concerns and orientations that eschew the pitfalls of ahistorical idealist orientations.<br>

Issue: i27719445<br>
Date: 8 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Boyd K. M.<br>
Abstract: Medical ethics, principles, persons, and perspectives is discussed under three headings: "History", "Theory", and "Practice". Under "Theory", the author will say something about some different approaches to the study and discussion of ethical issues in medicine–especially those based on principles, persons, or perspectives. Under "Practice", the author will discuss how one perspectives based approach, hermeneutics, might help in relation first to everyday ethical issues and then to public controversies. In that context some possible advantages of moving from controversy to conversation will be explored; and that will then be illustrated with reference to a current controversy about the use of human embryos in stem cell therapy research. The paper begins with history, and it begins in the author's home city of Edinburgh.<br>

Article Title: Why the Responsible Practice of Business Ethics Calls for a Due Regard for History<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27749757<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Bird Frederick<br>
Abstract: Typically people make ethical judgments with reference to unchanging principles, standards, rights, and values. This essay argues that such an ahistorical approach to ethics should be supplemented by a due regard for history. Invoking precedents by authors such as Jonsen and Toulmin, McIntyre, Niebuhr, Weber, De Tocqueville, Machiavelli and others, this essay explores several important ways in which a due regard for history can and should shape the practice of business ethics. Thus a due regard for history helps us both to cultivate fitting appreciation of cultural mores and to understand how current problems and issues have developed as they have; it helps us to gauge current responsibilities with respect legacies of problems inherited from the past; it helps us to develop a lively sense of what is possible in the present, given current contingencies and past experiences; and it moves us to rethink the practice of ethical auditing: not just as a backward-looking effort to gauge compliance but as a forward-looking way of learning from actual experiences and developing fitting responses.<br>

Issue: i330167<br>

Author(s): Messick Brinkley<br>
Abstract: Muftis are literate scholars who specialise in Muslim legal-religious interpretation. They provide an example of a higher level of systematic indigenous interpretation than the common sense, everyday constructions of reality that have been discussed in anthropological accounts. I discuss the institutional form of the muftiship, and contrast it with the judgeship, with reference to indigenous ideal-types found in several categories of written Muslim social thought. This ideal form is then compared with the identities of historical and contemporary muftis in Yemen. The interpretive method employed by muftis joins a Greek-derived concept of analogy with recitation and hermeneutics. While their method is structurally similar to scriptural interpretation, muftis are worldly interpreters who address practical life problems posed by lay questioners.<br>

Article Title: Rereading the Book in Henry James's The Ambassadors<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Daniel<br>
Abstract: Most analyses of developments in the religious discourse in Calvinist circles of Languedoc after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) have stressed its basic continuity. The expert comparison of sermons before 1685 with subsequent homilies at the end of the 17th century proves this "continuist" hypothesis to be false. Between the two periods, not only did the speakers change but also the structure of the discourse (transitive/intransitive) was modified as well as its relation to the text of reference (compromise on the meaning/ fundamentalism) and the function of speaking itself (intersocial saturation/intracommunity fragmentation). The pacified public discourse became a private one in a zone of textual violence.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first and third person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue into texts. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that focuses on reference, and results in "representing" dialogue. This obscures dialogue in the larger sense of constituting social reality. An indexical, rather than a referential approach to dialogue is developed through examination of indexing of social distance, discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications are traced out for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life.<br>

Abstract: In 1957, Francis Bacon rapidly painted a series of five numbered paintings after van Gogh's "Self-Portrait on the Road to Tarason," to fill an exhibition. They are exceptional in his work, both as to subject and in the way they are painted. A painter who regularly took reproduced images as his sources, he chose in this unique case the self-portrait of another artist, and used -- also uniquely -- methods evidently akin to those of 'action painting'. So selfhood and the practice of painting come into unusual conjunction in these works. Paul Ricoeur's attempt, in "Oneself as Another," to overcome the perennial self--other opposition, and his account of a constitutionally unstable self, lacking a 'core', are suggestive for discussion of the relationship between viewer and painting, specifically with reference to portraiture. He presents an alternative to the antinomial theories of the self which have long dominated criticism of visual art, theories according to which visual images mirror, and so crucially help to construct, an ego enclosed against the other; such a model is presumed in Ernst van Alphen's "Francis Bacon and the Loss of Self." Admittedly, this series of paintings is itself bound to invoke what Ricoeur terms 'hyperbolic' concepts of selfhood: van, Gogh, through his biographers, became the type of artist-as-genius; Minelli's biopic "Lust for Life," which Bacon probably saw, came out in 1956, and in the same year Jackson Pollock, prototypical 'action painter' died in a way that contributed to a comparable mythology. Against that, it is important to consider what Bacon does, and to notice the kinds of action, or interaction, tended to us as viewers. In context, the link with cinema assumes a different importance. Also crucial is Bacon's process of variation. Unlike philosophy, as Ricoeur shows, art can engage in play, freely varying all terms without a view to conclusion -- art experiments with the self. Bacon takes selfhood apart, recombines its elements; he~<br>

Abstract: This essay serves to introduce Jasper Johns' most recent series of paintings and, in particular, "Catenary (Manet-Degas)" of 1999 (Private collection). It does this with reference to the use that Johns made of a note from Marcel Duchamp's "Green Box" when, in 1959, he had to provide a statement about his art for inclusion in the catalogue that accompanied the 'Sixteen Americans' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Johns' use of this note is considered with regard to seeing and understanding "Flag" of 1954-55 (Museum of Modern Art, New York), "Souvenir" of 1964 (Collection of the artist on loan to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and "Catenary" (Manet-Degas). The essay insists on the distinction that can be made between the 'art object' and the 'work of art' and between the 'ordinary' or 'everyday self' of the artist who makes the former and the 'extraordinary self' of the artist that comes in place by way of the latter. In the work of art the human being tries 'to reach the Impossibility of a different way of being-in-the world and of being-at-one-with-itself'.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i370173<br>
Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Walkerdine Valerie<br>
Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Author(s): Malraux Vincent<br>
Abstract: Inspiré du récit de Joseph Kessel, "L'Armée des ombres," film de Jean-Pierre Melville, semble à bien des égards symboliser ce qu'a été l'engagement résistant. Mais s'agissait-il de représenter la Résistance ou de réfléchir sur les termes de sa figuration? Retour sur un film - mal reçu à sa sortie - qui constitue un cas d'école. Film inspiré du récit de Joseph Kessel, L'Armée des ombres ne constitue pas un film sur la Résistance, mais présente une réflexion sur les termes de sa figuration. Melville n'était sans doute pas mal placé pour proposer cette réflexion, comme cinéaste, bien sûr, mais comme résistant également - encore que son itinéraire, durant les années sombres, soit difficile à retracer. Le film, à sa sortie, fut mal reçu, en raison notamment d'une approche jugée gaulliste. Le décalage temporel nous montre pourtant que cette œuvre reste rebelle à toute classification. Tout en étant largement fidèle au récit de Kessel, elle élimine toute référence au politique, choisit de présenter la Résistance dans la variété de ses membres - qu'unit toutefois la mort qui les attend. Elle se caractérise surtout par une sobriété proche de l'épure qui évite, notamment, de transfigurer les résistants en héros. Melville, au demeurant, préfère filmer les hommes dans la délibération plutôt que dans l'action - une approche qui tranche avec les partis pris retenus par Claude Berri dans Lucie Aubrac. Les acteurs - connus - n'en sont pas moins devenus, aux yeux des spectateurs, l'incarnation symbolique mais vivante des résistants qui forgèrent l'armée des ombres. /// Le visage de l'histoire. A film inspired by Joseph Kessel's accounting, "The Army of the Shadows" is not a film on the Resistance, but presents thinking on the terms of its representations. Melville was undoubtedly in a good position to propose this thinking, as a filmmaker of course but also as a resistant, even though his itinerary during the dark years was hard to follow. When it came out the film was not well recei~<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i291342<br>
Date: 4 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Žižek Sergei<br>
Abstract: The literary epic Lāčplēsis, written in the nineteenth century, was a conscious attempt to create a cultural frame of reference for the emerging Latvian nation. In this article, which examines how poet Andrejs Pumpurs imagined his community, Kruks compares the Latvian epic hero with his Estonian counterpart, Kalevipoeg, who was invented at the same time under similar conditions of domination by Russians and Baltic Germans. Kruks's narrative analysis demonstrates the different frameworks through which social bonds are constructed for the heroes. Kalevipoeg is a pragmatic actor with an explicitly formulated duty; he errs, but he recognizes his personal responsibility. The Latvian hero Lāčplēsis, on the other hand, is not given a clearly formulated duty; he is simply a hero by destiny and definition. As a resource of symbols that feed contemporary discourses, the epic impedes the construction of a modern national identity capable of engendering a civic society through active pragmatic participation. For past generations, Lāčplēsis explained unjust foreign domination. Kruks argues that contemporary Latvian society now seeks a new frame of cultural reference that will permit the construction of a future-oriented national identity.<br>

Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Abstract: O presente estudo constitui um ensaio crítico de reflexão sobre a questão dos limites da linguagem em Wittgenstein. A perspectiva deste estudo observa, numa primeira parte, o próprio procedimento do método wittgen-steiniano e segue um modelo de discurso plural, a partir de várias perspectivas que, não só permitem desconstruir a aparente unidade da razão, como indagar interiormente do próprio limite da análise wittgensteiniana. Retomando a caracterização da linguagem e do pensamento nos seus traços fundamentais, desde o "Tractatus" até às "Investigações Filosóficas", chama-se a atenção para os pontos de dificuldade, da indefinição e da cons-trutividade do modelo de Wittgenstein. A plena lição do "autómaton" da linguagem face a uma possível diferenciação dos signos e aprofundamento lógico, constitui uma parte desta reflexão que se complementa pela referência aos horizontes de resíduo do não-linguístico, ou até do indizível, numa dupla maneira de estabelecer os limites da linguagem. Enfim, e a título conclusivo, apontam-se, não apenas os contornos do que se entende como uma moral retórica da linguagem em Wittgenstein, mas para perspectivas originais de um reaprofundamento em termos etioló-gicos de diferenciação de escala da lógica e da linguagem, e de recuperação de uma intencionalidade psico-lógico-linguística superando aquela indiferen-ciação do dizer no automático da fala estatuída na "ordinary language". /// La présente étude constitue un essai critique qui réfléchie sur la question des limites du langage dans la philosophie de Wittgenstein. Dans une première partie la perspective de cette réflexion analise les procédés que Wittgenstein lui-même utilise dans sa méthode, et pour cela se sert d'un modèle de discours pluriel, lequel permet non seulement la déconstruction de l'apparente unité de la raison, mais aussi faire une enquête au dedans des limites de l'analyse wittgensteinienne.

Issue: i40014488<br>
Date: 12 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Carr Thomas K.<br>
Abstract: In recent years, frequent reference has been made to philosophical hermeneutics by scholars working in theology. This is not surprising, for not only is Gadamer conversant with many historical and contemporary sources of Christian theology, and defends key theological concepts as integral to philosophical hermeneutics, there is also much in philosophical hermeneutics, especially when read as an ethics, that lends itself to the concerns of theologians. This essay argues first that Gadamer's project ought to be read as such, and then illustrates ways in which an iteration of Gadamerian hermeneutics as an ethics might be received by theologians, especially those wanting to trace the development of human self-understanding in its relations to religious traditions. /// No âmbito da teologia contemporânea fazem-se referências frequentes à hermenêutica filosófica. Isto não nos deve surpreender, já que, por um lado, Gadamer está amplamente familiarizado com muitas das fontes, tanto históricas como actuals, da teologia cristã, defendendo mesmo a proximidade de algumas noções centrais da teologia com a hermenêutica filosófica; por outro lado, no entanto, verifica-se que muito daquilo que faz parte da hermenêutica filosófica, sobretudo na medida em que a lermos como uma ética, se adapta perfeitamente a várias das preocupações metis distintas recentemente manifestadas por parte de alguns teólogos. O artigo começa por defender este modo de ler o projecto de Gadamer, procurando em seguida ilustrar modos segundo os quais uma iteraço da hermenêutica gadameriana enquanto etica deve ser acolhida por parte de todos quantos em teologia desejem relacionar o processo de desenvolvimento da autocompreensao humana com as grandes tradições religiosas.<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies. To the attacks on the atheist's side correspond, according to the theologian's side, either some resentement related to God or their excuse by means of calling in question God's omnipotence.

Abstract: No presente ensaio trata-se da relação entre filosofia e cristianismo no século XX a partir da consideração de uma problemática comum a estas experiências: o eclipse do sentido, ou seja, a perda de referênda a um horizonte a partir do qual o ser humano pode orientar-se na vida. Esta problemática, diferentemente declinada nas formas do excesso do mal, do niilismo e da indiferença religiosa, é uma das heranças com que hoje tanto a filosofia como o cristianismo têrn de se debater. O presente artigo reconstrói uma "genealogia filosófica" da atitude de indiferença e oferece deste fenómeno uma análise articulada. A partir daqui apresentam-se duas soluçõoes possíveis, capazes de unir ainda filosofia e cristianismo e que estão em posição defavorecer novas formas de co-implicação entre Deus, homem e mundo: a referênda aos aspectos "positivos" da indiferença e a atenção à esfera do emocional, na qual as motivações têrn ainda espaço. /// The present essay deals with the relation between philosophy and Christianity in the 20 th Century in relation to the eclipse of meaning, i. e., the lack of a horizon that constitutes a point of reference by which one might orient his/her life. This problematic, affected differently by excesses of evil, nihilism, and religious indifference in the last century, is at the heart of the debate. In view of this, the present article offers a "philosophical genealogy" of the attitude of indifference. On the basis of an analysis of this phenomenon, it proposes two possible solutions that might bring philosophy and Christianity together by reformulating the ways that God, man, and the world may be seen as co-implicated and by considering how this indifference can have positive aspects.<br>

Abstract: Dentro de los estudios de etnicidad —de otredad— que no son muy analizados por antropólogos, están los de migración, que este artículo retoma. Reconoce aspectos de la construcción de la otredad en la práctica cientifica, y sugiere formas de acercarse a los fenómenos étnicos, considerando la necesidad de ubicarlos históricamente y de enfocar las dimensiones cultural y politica de nuevos términos. A lo largo de todo el artículo se hace referencia al riesgo que representa la etnicidad —sobre todo la que "migra"— que se reafirma y se transforma en el mundo actual en constante cambio. /// Among ethnicity studies —about otherness— that are not much analyzed by anthropologists, are the ones about migration, which this article retakes. It recognizes aspects qn the construction of otherness in scientific practice, and suggests ways of approaching ethnic phenomena, considering the need of situating them historically and of focusing on the cultural and political dimensions of new terms. All along, reference is made to the risk an ethnicity that reaffirms and transforms itself in a present world in constant change, represents —above all, one that "migrates".<br>

Abstract: La ciudad habla a sus habitantes. En este artículo se presenta a la ciudad como texto, susceptible de distintas lecturas. Este nivel significativo orienta los comportamientos urbanos, da cuenta de su trama social y contiene las huellas de las decisiones históricas que incidieron en su construcción. En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds Anthony<br>
Abstract: This essay analyzes the role of the "dead metaphor" within deconstruction and neopragmatism in an attempt to elucidate some of the surreptitious affinities between the two discursive formations that would constitute what Derrida has called a "pragrammatology (to come)." On the basis of a thorough metaphorological rereading of philosophical thought that extends from Vico, Nietzsche, and Heidegger to Blumenberg, Derrida and Rorty, this essay argues that deconstruction continues to generate new contexts of meaning and reference in the form of a pragmatism that has long been integral to its discursive identity. /// Este artigo analisa o papel da "metáfora morta" em meio à desconstrução e ao neopragmatismo em uma tentativa de esclarecer algumas das afinidades subreptícias entre as duas formações discursivas que viriam a constituir aquilo que Derrida chamou de "pragramatologia (a vir)". Por meio de uma revisão metaforológica do pensamento filosófico que parte de Vico, passando por Nietzsche e Heidegger até Blumenberg, Derrida e Rorty, este artigo defende que a desconstrução continua a gerar novos contextos de sentido e de referência sob a forma de um pragmatismo que integra já há muito a sua identidade discursiva.<br>

With reference to Elyn Saks's memoir of her schizophrenia, we question the coherence ofStrawsons conception of the Episodic self and show why the capacity for narrative integration is important for a flourishing life. We aho argue that Scú< s's case and reflections on the therapeutic role of u illness nanatives }> put pressure on narrative theories that specify unduly restncúve constraints on self-constituting narratives, and chrify the need to distinguish identity from autonomy.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40027959<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Augustyn Leszek<br>
Abstract: The article deals with the philosophy of Nikolai Berdjaev (1874-1948), which he formulated between The Philosophy of Inequality (written in 1918, but published in 1923) and The New Middle-Ages (1924). Berdjaev's philosophy is analyzed in the context of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and its aftermath. The other point of reference is the crisis of culture and civilisation, which affected the West in the inter-war period. Berdjaev's position has been interpreted in view of the archetypal myth of the struggle of the two principles, the principle of order (cosmos) and the forces of destruction (chaos). This myth is tied to the millenialist world view. Berdjaev took an anti-utopian stance. He juxtaposed the utopianrevolutionary principle with the hierarchical-creative one. From this position he criticized among others democracy, liberalism and socialism. In the midst of the crisis of the 1920s he remarked the possibility of spiritual rejuvenation putting forward the concept of the New Middle-Ages. One can say that at that time Berdjaev's philosophy evolved within the conservative-creative framework, from the utopia of conservatism to the utopia of 'free creativity'.<br>

Abstract: A partir des réflexions de Paul Ricœur sur la temporalité et la narrativité, l'auteur envisage les processus discursifs de construction identitaire chez les jeunes gens en fin de scolarité obligatoire. L'identité en construction est appréhendée à travers le récit qu'ils donnent de leurs projets d'avenir et de leur histoire familiale. La présentation de soi, perçue dans cette double dimension, est soumise à un ensemble de schemes ou de modèles narratifs culturellement ancrés et socialement véhiculés. Elle prend forme et se constitue en une totalité cohérente et intelligible par une « mise en intrigue » de la diversité des péripéties vécues ou imaginées. The discursive processes that form young people's identities at the age when they leave school are discussed in reference to Paul Ricœur's notions of temporality and narrativity. The identities in formation are observed through these young people's accounts of their future plans and family histories. The presentation of the self — perceived in this two-dimensional way — fits into a set of schémas or nanative models rooted in culture, conveyed by society and forms a coherent, intelligible whole by « bringing into the plot » the diversity of imagined or actually experienced events.<br>

Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
Abstract: Given World and Time is a collection of essays that summarizes much of the recent work on the theory of time, including cultural, political, and social conceptualizations of temporality. The grounding narrative of this collection, roughly stated, leads from the German and German-Jewish ideas of a temporality of crisis developed in the 1920s, to the French poststructuralism of the 1960s and 1970s, and concludes with the American syntheses of the 1980s and 1990s. Methodologically, the book weaves together different historical narratives with a new emphasis on their temporal dimension, all seen from the perspective of critical theory and recent cultural critique. However, it is interesting to point out that the majority of the articles do not challenge the classic critical tools of modernism, in spite of the frequent reference to poststructuralist critique. The volume editor has also not acknowledged more recent work that treats similar topics and themes through the application of a radical political critique, most significantly the work associated with biopolitics and the so-called theological turn.<br>

Abstract: Lately, the concept of experience, which postmodernist theoreticians declared dead, has seen renaissance. The immediacy of experience seems to offer the possibility of reaching beyond linguistic discourses. In their attempt to overcome the "linguistic turn," scholars such as Ankersmit, Gumbrecht, and Runia pit experience against narrative. This paper takes up the recent interest in experience, but argues against the opposition to narrative into which experience tends to be cast. The relation between experience and narrative is more complex than is widely assumed. Besides representing and giving shape to experience, narratives are received in the form of a (reception) experience. Through their temporal structure, narratives are crucial to letting us re-experience the past as well as to representing the experiences of historical agents. This potential of narrative is nicely illustrated by Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War in which "side-shadowing" devices restore history's experientiality. Through "side-shadowing," narrative can challenge the tendency toward teleologies inherent in merely retrospective histories and can re-create the openness intrinsic to the past when it still was a present. However, the "side-shadowing" devices used by Thucydides are fictional. To conceptualize the price and gain of "side-shadowing" in historiography, the paper advances the concept of a "narrative reference" (a concept analogous to Ricoeur's "metaphorical reference"). Introspection, speeches, and other "side-shadowing" devices sacrifice truth in a positivist sense, but permit a second-level reference, namely to history's experientiality. In a final step, the paper turns toward modern historians—most of whom are reluctant to use the means of fiction—to briefly survey their attempts at restoring the openness of the past.<br>

Abstract: Différence, référence, communicabilité : trois mots-clés pour dessiner la structure originaire et élémentaire de la signifiance. Or, l'interrogation change de nature quand on la déplace du signifié vers le sens, puis vers la signifiance. Il ne s'agit ni d'une action, ni d'un événement, mais d'un processus. Trois conditions nécessaires : présence d'un matériel signifiant (sonore, graphique, électronique) ; aptitude à se référer à une réalité extérieure ; énonciateurs en relation binaire entre lesquels et pour lesquels les énoncés signifient. L'auteur examine les conséquences de leur considération groupée en philosophie du langage. Difference, reference and communicability are three key-words to outline the original and elementary structure of« signifying ». Now, the nature of philosophical interrogation changes when it shifts from the saussurian « signifié » towards the meaning, a fortiori towards signifying. It is neither an action nor an event but a process. Three conditions are necessary : the presence of specific material (whether acoustic, graphic or electronical) ; an aptitude to refer to an outside reality ; speakers standing in binary relationship. The writer examines the consequences of considering the constraints as gathered in a philosophy of language.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport qu'entretiennent histoire et mémoire à l'école est complexe et ambigu. Jusqu'aux années quatrevingt-dix, il a surtout été posé comme la relation, légitimée ou dénoncée, entre savoirs historiques, histoire scolaire et mémoire nationale. Dès les années soixante, le débat prend en compte le rapport entre le récit national et des histoires régionalistes qui revendiquent une place dans la culture scolaire, au nom des identités et du droit au passé. Cette dernière acception prévaut largement à l'heure actuelle mais cette fois au nom des minorités dépossédées de leur histoire, dès lors qu'elle n'a pas d'expression publique. Dans ces débats, la mémoire serait la forme d'une histoire parallèle, occultée et clandestine ; de leur côté les historiens tendent à distinguer histoire et mémoire. L'histoire scolaire, elle, admet l'histoire mais non les mémoires comme savoir de référence légitime ; pourtant les commémorations et le « devoir de mémoire » s'y invitent de plus en plus fréquemment. De telles évolutions interrogent les composantes de la discipline scolaire : au premier chef les finalités et les contenus mais aussi les pratiques, inégalement connues dans ce domaine et, finalement, les apprentissages souvent plus espérés qu'avérés. The connection that exists at school between history and memory is complicated and ambiguous; it is source of debate and demands which recently intensified with public and political uses. School history accepts history but not memories as good legitimate reference. And yet commemoration ceremonies and the "duty to remember" are more and more in the schools. Such changes question the elements of that school subject: its purpose of building identity and citizenship, its contents and their changes, its teaching practices, not really evenly known in this field, and finally the learning that is more often wished for than actually delivered. La relación que mantienen historia y memoria en la Escuela es compleja y ambigua; alimenta debates y ~<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions f~<br>

Abstract: Theodore Abel belonged before Talcott Parsons to the pioneers of "Weberians"' kind in America. In his Systematic Sociology in Germany the first systematic exposure of Max Weber's ideas in English appeared. Abel was the first to use Verstehen and Verstehende Soziologie in English literature. Abel also pioneered the research on the Nazi phenomenon. The manifestations of nazism and communist totalitarianism in the 20th century put the sociological theory and methodology to a critical test. Examining Abel's work as a case study, it is possible to see more clearly the ethical and methodological problems of the humanistic sociology—the "understanding" or interpretative one. The sense and implications of understanding in sociology still require greater clarity in order to better understand the understanding. Abel's diary sheds light on the methodological problems of his understanding research of nazism. The source of danger and ethical dilemmas of that discipline lies in the tradition of understanding sociology and Weber's method of ideal types connected with the principle of freedom from valuation. Also in that very tradition there are beginnings for development of its rightful cause and vocation. Provided, just like in Znaniecki's concept of humanistic coefficient, not only meanings but also valuations and social sentiments given in people's experience are taken into account. Full understanding cannot imply complete tolerance if meanings and values of individuals and groups are coupled with hate and other hostile feelings. Social feelings—hate and love (altruism)— constitute a sociologist's axiological system of negative and positive reference.<br>

Abstract: The French philosopher and intellectual historian Pierre Hadot (1922-2010) is known primarily for his conception of philosophy as spiritual exercise, which was an essential reference for the later Foucault. An aspect of his work that has received less attention is a set of methodological reflections on intellectual history and on the relationship between philosophy and history. Hadot was trained initially as a philosopher and was interested in existentialism as well as in the convergence between philosophy and poetry. Yet he chose to become a historian of philosophy and produced extensive philological work on neo-Platonism and ancient philosophy in general. He found a philosophical rationale for this shift in his encounter with Wittgenstein's philosophy in the mid-1950s (Hadot was one of Wittgenstein's earliest French readers and interpreters). For Hadot, ancient philosophy must be understood as a series of language games, and each language game must be situated within the concrete conditions in which it happened. The reference to Wittgenstein therefore supports a strongly contextualist and historicist stance. It also supports its exact opposite: presentist appropriations of ancient texts are entirely legitimate, and they are the only way ancient philosophy can be existentially meaningful to us. Hadot addresses the contradiction by embracing it fully and claiming that his own practice aims at a coincidence of opposites (a concept borrowed from the Heraclitean tradition). For Hadot the fullest and truest way of doing philosophy is to be a philosopher and a historian at the same time.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo explora cuestiones relacionadas con la nueva diversidad y complejidad de la cultura europea, y procura hacerlo con referencia a debates contemporáneos en torno al cosmopolitismo. Un argumento central es que las ciencias sociales "dominantes" permanecen inadecuadas, en tanto que tratan estas cuestiones de forma abstracta y de manera superficial -sin tocar a nadie. El artículo propone una aproximación más concreta y sustantiva a la agenda cosmopolita -incluso poética-, ofreciendo sugerencias en términos de discursos alternativos relevantes -aquellos que han sido marginados a través de la elaboración histórica de lo que ha devenido la versión hegemónica de la cultura y tradición europeas. Se presenta una exploración de términos como "asombro" y "metamorfosis" (aparentemente obsoletos y quizás excéntricos), así como de la importancia comunicativa del pensamiento metafórico. Se argumenta que, al abordar el dilema cultural europeo contemporáneo, la finalidad es desarrollar un evocativo, y por lo tanto significativo y comunicativo, discurso en torno ai cosmopolitismo -en efecto, otra manera de narrarlo. This article explores issues relating to the new diversity and complexity within European culture, and seeks to do so with reference to contemporary debates on cosmopolitanism. A central argument is that the "mainstream" social science remains inadequate, in that it deals with the issues in an abstract and formulaic way -touching no-one. The article argues for a more concrete and substantive (and even poetic) approach to the cosmopolitan agenda, putting forward suggestions as to relevant alternative discourses -discourses that have been marginalised in and through the historical elaboration of what has become the hegemonic version of European culture and tradition. There is an exploration of such (seemingly obsolete, and maybe eccentric) terms as "wonder" and "metamorphosis", and of the communicative significance of metaphorical thinking.

Abstract: El artículo pretende responder a alguno de los interrogantes abiertos en la historiografía internacional ante una actualidad saturada de memoria y las implicaciones político-sociales derivadas del «uso público de la historia». Desde esta perspectiva, se rastrean los conceptos utilizados para explicar el tratamiento propiamente histórico de los problemas, subrayar las polémicas esenciales y derivarlas hacia el espacio público en el que se celebran las ceremonias de la consagración memorial. El artículo continúa con una rápida visión panorámica del desarrollo de la historiografía contemporánea en las últimas décadas del siglo xx, distinguiendo tres grandes espacios/momentos de convergencia y enfrentamiento de la memoria con la práctica historiográfica. Y termina con una afirmación acerca de la posición del historiador, de su condición histórica y sus implicaciones con el mundo vertiginoso del presente donde la memoria y el olvido aparecen como dos puntos de referencia irrenunciables para el conocimiento de la historia contemporánea. The article pretends to give an answer to some of the open questions in the international historiography: a present time overloaded with memory and the social and political implications derived from the «public use of history». The concepts used to explain the historic treatment proper are investigated from that perspective; the essential polemics are underlined and directed towards the public space in which the ceremonies of the memorial consecration are celebrated. The article continues with a fast panoramic vision of the development of contemporary historiography in the last decades of the XXth century following three important moments / spaces of confrontation of the memory with the historiographie practice. It ends dealing with the position of the historian, his historical condition and his implication in the rapid world of the present where memory and oblivion appear as two unrenounceable reference points for the knowledge of the con~<br>

Author(s): Casler Kenneth<br>
Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Abstract: To refer to reality in literature has often been incorrectly understood as the fact that the author designates elements of the real world of his time, term for term as it were and as if everyone would agree on what constitutes "the real world of his time"; from this point of view, an author such as Proust is cut off from reality... This is to miss the degree to which Proust's practice of language asks the relevant questions about reference as it tries to refer to reality, namely the phenomenological question of the way we dynamically construct at least the reality we perceive.<br>

Abstract: This paper considers the communitarian critique of the method of economics, especially in regard to its methodological individualism, with reference in particular to cultural economics. It asks whether cultural goods can be modelled in a meaningful way under the usual assumptions in neoclassical economics about individual economic agents. Special attention is paid to Charles Taylor's critique of "atomism", and his suggestion that some goods are "irreducibly social". The implications of the critique for (1) public funding of the arts, and (2) copyright policy, are considered.<br>

Abstract: Norbert Elias never presented his views regarding collective memory in a systematic manner. However, his approach may be reconstructed on the basis of such works as The Civilizing Process, Time: An Essay and The Symbol Theory. The most important tenet of Elias is that human memory can only be explained by the symbol theory. Human ability to use socially created symbols in communication is applied in activities in which symbols are used (speaking, thinking, knowing and remembering), which makes memory a part of general process of symbolic communication. Memory research needs to account for the interactive and communicational origins of both individual and collective remembering. One of the crucial issues related to remembering is collective forgetting. According to Elias it operates by three main mechanisms: (1) elimination and creation of fantastic notions (fantasy being a substitute and subsidiary for experience), (2) modification of social canons of reference as a result of power struggle in social figurations, and (3) delegitimization of alternative imageries by means of marginalization or elimination of groups acting as their social vehicles. I discuss these mechanisms and the dynamics of memory they entail in the broader conceptual framework of the theory of civilizing processes referring to Central and Eastern European examples in order to demonstrate the productivity of Elias's interdisciplinary and multidimensional analysis in social memory studies focusing this region.<br>

Abstract: From the work of Weber onwards charisma has been primarily explained in terms of its relationship to underlying social structural and psychological environments. The paper redresses this imbalance and examines the cultural structures that operate as preconditions for the attribution of charisma to political and religious leaders. Drawing on Weberian, Durkheimian and semiotic theory the paper argues that charisma arises in conjunction with salvation narratives. The internal structure of these narratives requires binary oppositions contrasting good and evil. The model is exemplified with reference to case studies of Hitler, Churchill and Martin Luther King.<br>

Abstract: This article deals with the problem of text and ¡ mage in contemporary art, as exemplified in a photograph by Jeff Wall called The Storyteller (1986). This image is analysed, taking as reference Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe as well as Walter Benjamin's essay of 1936 on the subject of the narrator. The main points in this comparative analysis are the role of the narrator both in text and image, oral tradition versus visual space, the concept of the picture and the tradition of story representation. The author proposes the idea that modernity introduced a major change in the art of storytelling and in the narrative function of image.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le Sakuteiki (Notes sur l'arrangement des jardins, XIe siècle) jusqu'aux jardins de daïmyôs de l'époque d'Edo (1603-1867), le jardin japonais est empreint d'une tendance marquée à référer les formes de ses constituants à des sites et à des paysages modèles dénommés « sites de renom » (meisho). Ce système de référence est appelé mitate, ce qui signifie littéralement « instituer par le regard ». Cela se rapporte, d'une part, au principe de la métaphore, et, d'autre part, au dynamisme fondamental des localisations dans l'écoumène, tel que l'illustrent le couple topos/chôra dans le Timée et la distinction que fait Nishida entre logique d'identité du sujet et logique d'identité du prédicat. Fron the Sakuteiki (Notes on the making of gardens, XIth c.) to daimyos gardens of the Edo period (1603-1867), the Japanese gardens display a prominent tendency to refer its material forms to paradigmatic places and landscapes, called « places with a name » (meisho). This system of reference was called mitate, which literaly means « instituting by seeing ». It is here related, on the one hand, to the principle of metaphor, and on the other hand to the fundamental dynamics of place in the ecumene, as illustrated by the couple topos/chôra in the Timaios and by Nishida's dictinstion between a logic of the identity of the subject and a logic of the identity of the predicate (or logic of place).<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the attitude of the Czech literary critic Václav Černý to his fellow critic and compatriot F. X. Šalda, that is to say, Černý's self-stylization, which was defined in polemical reference to Šalda, and also the way Černý 'broadcast' it or concealed it - the primary feature of his technique. Concerning the question of whether literary criticism is a science or an art, the author does not state that Šalda was correct in his Stance against Černý nor, for that matter, that Černý was correct in his against Šalda: the construct of Černý's 'Co je kritika, co není a k čemu je na světě' [What Criticism Is, What It Is Not, and Why It Exists at All] is just as valid as Šalda's claim. The article seeks to demonstrate that in particular it was in his conception of literary criticism that Černý needed to distance himself from Šalda. The fact that Černý could argue for his own method only thanks to Šalda's not having declared criticism a science is only seemingly a paradox. The article also points out parallels between Šalda’s Boje o zítřek and Černý's Osobnost, tvorba a boj, which are interesting particularly for the way the narrow correspondence between the two works then stands out and how Černý in fact barely discussed Šalda at ali. The affinity of the two critics emphasizes how important it was for Černý to stress the difference between himself and his predecessor in the very area in which he was in fact most similar to him.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Abstract: In the late twentieth century two conceptions of text in a literary work followed from the original distinction between Sinn (smysl, sense) and Bedeutung (význam, reference), which was made by Gottlob Frege in 1892 - namely, those of Wolfgang Iser and Paul Ricoeur. For us, they are interesting for their direct or indirect affinity to Czech Structuralism. The article presents a detailed comparison of the two conceptions: Iser's 'act of reading', culminating in the 'play of the text', and Ricoeur's proposal of 'productive reference', which heads towards the references (Bedeutungen) of a world that is irmagined, without actually being, and announces itself through the creative power of language. The article concludes by returning to the question of the game and reference in the work of Iser and Eugene Fink. Play and art guard the vitality of sense.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40110325<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Gavey Nicola<br>
Abstract: Academic interest in applications of rhetoric to social issues is undergoing a revival. This paper develops a rhetorical analysis of discourse generated by men who have been recently violent towards women. The texts have been drawn from transcribed interviews with 14 men who had recently begun or were about to attend stopping violence programmes. Each 90-minute interview prompted the men on their views towards women, violence and relationships. A range of rhetorical devices within the texts were identified and their effect was analysed. This paper focuses on five devices: reference ambiguity, axiom markers, metaphor, synecdoche and metonymy. The strategic effects of each device are discussed with close reference to sample passages from the transcripts. The paper explores how these rhetorical devices resource discourses of male dominance and entitlement to power, and how these in turn resource men in their violence towards women. Increased sensitivity to the nuanced effects of the rhetoric is seen to improve understanding of how men justify, camouflage and maintain positions of dominance within relationships with women.<br>

Abstract: "Empathy" and "contagion" are semantically related in their common reference to the suffering of infectious disease, spiritual and physical. How exactly do they differ as interpersonal phenomena? René Girard establishes a link between mimetic behavior and the contagious transference of emotion that spreads through groups of people, resulting in victimage. Jewish philosophers Edith Stein and Simone Weil distinguish such an emotional transference from genuine empathy, which involves a different, ethical stance and a saintly imitation. Empathy for the afflicted individual, in fact, makes one immune to the contagion that too often results in scapegoating.<br>

Author(s): van Alphen Ernst<br>
Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Author(s): BARTLETT Steven<br>
Abstract: An attempt is made to suggest an alternative approach to certain of the problems central to transcendental philosophy. In particular, it seems that the present understanding of pre-reflective awareness, of reflection, and of their interrelation can acquire a greater degree of rigour and clarity. To this end, attention is paid to preconditions of reference that are entailed by the phenomenological distinction between implicit experience and explicit reflection. L'auteur propose un accès alternatif à certains problèmes centraux de la philosophie transcendentale. En particulier, il paraît que la compréhension des idées de conscience préréflexive, de réflexion, et de Jeurs relations mutuelles, peut être précisée et élucidée. A cet effet, l'attention est attirée sur les préconditions de référence qui sont impliquées par la distinction phénoménologique entre l'expérience implicite et la réflexion explicite. Der Autor versucht, eine alternative Untersuchungsmethode zu bestimmten Hauptproblemen der transzendentalen Philosophie darzustellen. Insbesondere könnte das gegenwärtige Verständnis der vorreflexiven Bewusstheit, der Reflexion, und ihres Zusammenhangs strenger aufgeklärt werden. Zu diesem Zweck wird Aufmerksamkeit auf die Beziehungsvorbedingungen gerichtet, die in der phänomenologischen Unterscheidung zwischen impliziter Erfahrung und expliziter Reflexion miteinbegriffen sind.<br>

Abstract: La personnalité, l'activité et l'œuvre de Gonseth peuvent être interprétés organiquement dans une instructive pédagogie de dialogue. L'auteur évoque a) la structure dialogale intime de Gonseth, b) les dialogues peu fructueux qu'il a entretenus avec le Cercle de Vienne, puis lors des Entretiens de Zurich, c) les dialogues qu'il a imaginés dans Les mathématiques et la réalité entre trois personnages: Parfait, Sceptique et Idoine, auxquels vient s'ajouter à la fin le Nouvel Idoine, d) les rencontres avec les néo-scolastiques à Rome, e) la «doctrine» explicite du dialogue exposée dans La loi du dialogue. L'auteur s'interroge aussi sur les conditions d'un dialogue fécond et sur les obstacles qui peuvent s'y opposer, (en particulier: l'incompatibilité des référentiels). Gonseth the man, his life and his work can be interpreted organically in an instructive account of dialogue. The author treats the following topics: a) Gonseth's intimate dialogical structure, b) the fruitless dialogues he had with the Vienna Circle and then at the Entretiens de Zurich, c) his imaginary dialogues in Les mathématiques et la réalité between the characters Perfect, Sceptic and Appropriate, and finally New Appropriate, d) his contacts with neo-scholastics at Rome, e) the explicit 'doctrine' of dialogue presented in La loi du dialogue. The article is also concerned with conditions for a fruitful dialogue and with obstacles that can stand in the way (in particular, the incompatibility of reference systems). Die Persönlichkeit, die Aktivitäten und das Werk Gonseths können im Rahmen einer lehrreichen Pädagogik des Dialogs einheitlich interpretiert werden. Der Autor erörtert a) die intime Dialogstruktur Gonseths; b) die wenig fruchtbaren Dialoge, die er mit dem Wiener Kreis und während der Zürcher Gespräche führte; c) die Dialoge dreier Figuren, die er in Les mathématiques et la réalité in Szene gesetzt hat: Perfekt, Skeptiker und Geeignet, zu denen sich am Schluss der Neue Geeignete hinzugesellt; ~<br>

Author(s): MALHERBE Jean-François<br>
Abstract: Dans le prolongement de la philosophie de Wittgenstein, les contributions récentes de Quine et de Searle invitent à modifier la manière de poser la question de la signification des termes théoriques : ne faudrait-il pas substituer à une préoccupation principalement ontologique (que désignent les termes théoriques ?) un souci plus praxéologique (quel rôle les termes théoriques tiennent-ils dans l'articulation des discours et des pratiques scientifiques ?). C'est ce renversement qu'il s'agit d'opérer ici. Starting from the philosophy of Wittgenstein, more recent works of Quine and Searle are presented. This reflexion leads to a modification of the way of considering the meaning of theoretical terms. It is suggested that, in place of a mainly ontological point of view (what is the reference of theoretical terms), a more praxeological point of view is more appropriate (which is the use of theoretical terms for the building of sciences and for scientific work). The goal of this article is to consider this change of perspective.<br>

Abstract: Au début des années 70 P. Ricœur travaillait à un rapprochement entre sémantique et herméneutique, projet qu'il n'a pas, semble-t-il, repris ultérieurement. Dans sa défense de la référence au monde contre les attaques des sémioticiens français, il était conduit à généraliser le rapport de référence à tout discours, y compris la poésie. Refusant autant le relativisme que le positivisme, il tentait d'unifier en une conception tensionnelle les termes des distinctions tranchées de la théorie classique. Dans cette perspective la logique du jugement accueille la créatitivé de la métaphore ; l'épistémologie des sciences reconnaît la valeur des modèles heuristiques ; et l'ontologie du discours s'adapte au pluralisme de notre rapport au monde à travers les œuvres littéraires. Tous ces déplacements d'accent devaient assurer une transition continue de la sémantique à l'herméneutique sans quitter le terrain du monde pour les abîmes de l'interprétation infinie. At the beginning of the seventies P. Ricœur was working upon the possibility of bringing together semantics and hermeneutics, although he did not, apparently, follow this line of concern thereafter. In his defense of the reference to the world against the French semiotician's attacks, he was driven to generalize the relation of reference to all kinds of discourse, poetry included. Rejecting relativism as much as positivism, he tried to unify in a tensional view the terms of the clear-cut distinctions of classical theory. From this point of view, the logic of judgement turns out to welcome the creativity of metaphor ; the epistemology of the sciences recognizes the worth of heuristic models ; and the ontology of discourse fits the pluralism of the relation to the world opened up to us by the literary works. All these shifts of emphasis were intended as securing a smooth transition from semantics to hermeneutics, without leaving the firm ground of the world for the depths of infinite interpretation.<br>

Abstract: L étude veut montrer que l'individualité n'appartient ni aux êtres inanimés, ni aux espèces biologiques mais qu'elle est une propriété de chaque être vivant au sens du langage courant. L'ontogenèse de l'individu est analysée sous trois aspects: 1. morphogénétique ou formatif, à partir du moment où le nouveau vivant se distingue de ses procréateurs tant chez les organismes à reproduction végétative que chez les organismes à reproduction sexuée ; 2. immunologique, par lequel l'organisme constitue son « soi » et discrimine entre le « soi » et le « non-soi » ; 3. psychologique, où entre en compte toute l'histoire relationnelle du vivant avec le monde extérieur. Chez tout vivant, de l'unicellulaire à l'homme, l'individualité acquise est complémentaire de l'individualité innée, déterminée par le matériel génétique. Mais la racine même de l'individualité doit être cherchée dans la dimension ontologique de l'être vivant qui est à l'origine des propriétés du système biologique : unité, subsistance dynamique, autonomie, indépendance, capacité d'auto-organisation, etc. L'évolution de l'individualité, coextensible à l'évolution de la vie, elle-même coextensible à l'évolution de l'être et de l'unité, témoigne de son caractère analogique. Définir l'individualité comme l'unicité propre à un système biologique nous paraît respecter son caractère analogique et cerner les éléments fondamentaux qui la constituent. The scope of this study is to show that individuality does not belong either to inanimate bodies or to biological species but is an attribute of the « living being » as commonly understood. The ontogenesis of the individual is analyzed with reference to three aspects : 1. morphogenetic or formative, from the time a new living being becomes distinct from its progenitors, in both cases of vegetative and sexual reproduction ; 2. immunologital, from which an organism establishes its « self » and distinguishes between « self » and « non-self » ; 3. psychological, in which the ent~<br>

Abstract: « Le moment topologique » désigne la référence commune à la topologie faite par de nombreux auteurs dans les années soixante (Merleau-Ponty, Lacan, Deleuze, Foucault, Derrida). Dans le paradigme phénoménologique, il conditionna deux réponses antonymes: d'un côté, chez Merleau-Ponty, il ouvrit la voie vers une nouvelle réduction, d'un autre côté, chez Derrida, il permit une rupture d'avec le cadre méthodologique de la phénoménologie. C'est pourtant le dépassement de cette opposition qui est ici proposé. « The topological moment » denotes the common reference to topology developed by numerous authors during the 1960's (Merleau-Ponty, Lacan, Deleuze, Foucault, Derrida). In the phenomenological paradigm, it created two antonymous responses: on one side, Merleau-Ponty paved the way for a new reduction, on the other side, Derrida facilitated a break from the methodical framework of phenomenology. However, this article proposes to move beyond this opposition.<br>

Abstract: Le langage de la poésie appelle une attention particulière, car son ètrangetè même témoigne d'un rapport au réel fort différent des pratiques de la langue, dans la vie quotidienne ou dans le travail scientifique. En s'aidant de la référence au Vide et aux perspectives puisées dans la tradition chinoise, Maldiney développe cette philosophie propre à la poésie à partir des oeuvres d'André du Bouchet et de Francis Ponge. Son analyse donne ainsi à l'art poétique une responsabilité rarement mise en valeur par rapport au réel: un rapport à la fois d'intimité et de proximité. The language of poetry calls for special attention, since its strangeness itself verifies a very different way to relate to real for the practices of language — in everyday life or in the scientific work. With the help of reference to Emptiness and to perspectives from Chinese tradition, Maldiney develops that philosophy peculiar to poetry from the works of André du Bouchet and Francis Ponge. Thus, his analysis gives a rarely highlighted responsibility to poetic art regarding the real: both an intimate and a close relationship.<br>

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Abstract: Aristote accorde une importance telle à la prudence qu'elle est le véritable lien de la politique et de l'éthique à travers toute sa philosophie de l'action. Pourtant, et à cause de cette importance, il ne peut guère la définir. Il ne la cerne pas par approximation comme une vertu morale ni par classification comme un régime politique. La prudence est la vertu intellectuelle, le concept imposé par le fait que la politique et l'éthique ne sont jamais entièrement liées et jamais entièrement déliées. La prudence machiavélienne radicalise cet enseignement; elle ne le rompt pas : là où la prudence aristotélicienne indique que politique et éthique ne peuvent être très séparées, l'habileté machiavélienne indique qu'elles ne peuvent être très liées. Ce n'est qu'avec Hobbes qu'on est en présence de la construction systématique d'une théorie dans laquelle la politique l'emporte entièrement sur l'éthique. Kant renverse cette priorité au seul profit de l'éthique. La recherche aristotélicienne fait finalement figure de moins mauvaise solution. Elle sort l'éthique du purisme et la politique de la pure force. En tout cas, sans référence à une relation entre la politique et l'éthique, la recherche de la prudence est peu probable. La croyance récente en la toute-puissance de l'histoire l'a montré. The importance which Aristotle sets on prudence makes it the real link between politics and ethics throughout his whole philosophy of action. Nevertheless, and because of this importance, he cannot define it. He does not approach it through approximation, as a moral virtue, nor by classification, as a political regime. Prudence is the intellectual virtue, the concept imposed by the fact that politics and ethics are never either entirely linked or entirely separate. Machiavellian prudence radicalizes this teaching, but does not upset it : whereas Aristotelian prudence indicates that politics and ethics cannot be widely separate, Machiavellian cunning indicates that they cannot be very close~<br>

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a definition of translation as a form of writing under constraint. Quite straightforwardly, the translator must write the original text again in a language other than the one in which it was originally composed. Both inhibiting and enabling, that restriction is also translation's resource, ensuring its distinctiveness as a writing practice and providing the key to its unique transformative possibilities. Like lipogrammatical writing, translation is inaugurated by its constraint. The article explores the affinity between translation and the lipogram with reference to Georges Perec's La Disparition, where the prohibition of the letter e initiates a peculiarly inventive kind of writing. Peculiarly inventive, because the effects generated by writing without a given letter of the alphabet, or by writing a given text again in another, altogether different, language, are essentially unprogrammable: we do not know what is going to happen.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i40128002<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Daniels John<br>
Abstract: Desire is examined here with a view to informing a theological response to capitalism. The notion of mimetic desire offered by René Girard is used as a starting point, Girard's ideas being brought into critical engagement with, first, other intersubjective accounts, namely those offered by Alexandre Kojève and by psychoanalysis in its Freudian and Lacanian variants; and then the account of desire as productive becoming offered by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, in which the link to capitalism is explicit. It is suggested that both mimetic desire and its productive counterpart can be understood as asserting the priority of desire itself over both subject and object. The possibilities for framing a coherent theological account of desire which is both mimetic and productive are then assessed with reference to Bernard of Clairvaux, Aquinas and Augustine, noting that accepting a metaphysics of participation makes plausible a productive desire which is nonetheless coded as a mimesis of the divine precedent. Such a conclusion brings into relief the inevitable difficulty of reconciling Christian and capitalist economies of desire.<br>

Article Title: The Story of Abraham and Models of Human Identity<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i40128072<br>
Date: 5 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mills Mary<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the profiles of the women characters Sarah and Hagar as models of human identity. The two characters can only be explored through reading the over-arching narrative of the story of Abraham. Their profiles and narrated personalities have to be extracted from that narrative, but there is a two-sided nature of this necessity. If Sarah and Hagar cannot be separated from the biblical narrator's engagement with father Abraham, neither can Abraham function as father of the nations except through his interaction with these two women. The reader is thus led towards an understanding of how the stories of Genesis 12-24 deal with the issue of parenthood. The body of the paper consists in a close reading of the biblical material following a method of reading which is rooted in the use of imagination as an exegetical tool - a style adopted by Paul in his allegorical approach to Sarah and Hagar in Galatians 4. This approach opens into narrative criticism with a focus on characterisation and on the interactions of Sarah, Hagar and Abraham, caught up in a Domestic Comedy. The women's characters are explored through the themes of parenthood as other, the other woman and woman as other. A final section explores some of the points of narrative ethics to be extracted from the close textual readings of the paper, with reference to the writings of Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas. It is suggested that female as well as male characters may offer fruitful models for human identity.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services, Inc.<br>
Issue: i40153707<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Condor Susan<br>
Abstract: Conspiracy accounting is often regarded as an atypical, pathological form of political reasoning, and little research has considered how ordinary social actors may refer to political conspiracies in the course of argument. In this article, we consider the spontaneous use of conspiracy narratives by politically engaged Greek citizens in interview discussions of the Macedonian crisis. Analysis revealed that conspiracy narratives were typically used to challenge dominant representations that attributed the Macedonian crisis to Greek xenophobic nationalism. Specifically, conspiracy accounts were used to dispute assumptions concerning Greece's majority status by representing the political opposition as a consortium rather than a single out-group, by recasting the threat posed to Greece as a matter of realistic rather than symbolic competition, and by extending the historical frame of reference to encompass past and prospective future threats to the Greek people and the Greek state. In conclusion, we note how the use of conspiratorial reasoning may be used to construct complex causal arguments concerning intergroup relations and to challenge dominant ideological assumptions about social hierarchy and political legitimacy. In this respect, conspiratorial reasoning might be regarded as a prototypical form of intergroup representation.<br>

Author(s): Hoskins Gareth<br>
Abstract: An interest in narrative has done much to shed light on our understandings of geography. Studies linking narrative to nation building, the making of place, identity, the region, the spaces of health, heritage, and environmental history, give some indication of the breadth at which geographical scholarship has been pushed forward by an applied interest in stories. This article attempts to develop such work with a particular focus on the performative capacities of narrative; how stories might work towards various recuperative outcomes. It discusses the revision of historic tours around Angel Island Immigration Station, a California State Park property and National Historic Landmark with reference to the term narrative economy. The Immigration Station plays host to a narrative economy where stories circulating around the site acquire value on the basis of their factual content and their compatibility with a set of approved messages. Some of these stories are disputed and devalued so as to distinguish them from factual 'histories' produced by recently commissioned research. The article considers how heritage sites negotiate tensions between the burden of representational accuracy and the need to function more broadly as platforms for liberatory intervention.<br>

Abstract: Issu des recherches d'une quinzaine d'exégètes, cet ouvrage, de style universitaire, est destiné à présenter à un large public un panorama des recherches johanniques contemporaines. Très diversifié quant aux thèmes abordés, il introduira lectrices et lecteurs aux questions irrésolues que pose l'histoire des communautés johanniques et de leur production littéraire. De nombreux auteurs s'interrogent sur la signification des relectures et des retouches successives. Ainsi, l'ouvrage rejoint l'aspect le plus énigmatique du corpus johannique (évangile et épîtres). Les écrits johanniques ont été dès l'origine et demeurent au centre de conflits d'interprétations; de ces conflits, comme des hypothèses les plus diverses, le livre a le mérite de rendre compte. Ainsi, il se montre digne de figurer parmi les ouvrages de référence sur ce sujet. This collection, the work of fifteen exegetes and edited by Kaestli, Poffet and Zumstein, presents a panorama of contemporary Johannine research for the benefit of the larger public. Touching upon many themes, it introduces the reader to the unresolved questions concerning the Johannine communities and their literature. Several authors question the significance of rereadings and successive alterations, the most enigmatic aspect of the Johannine corpus (gospel and epistles). The collection has the merit of presenting the diverse hypothesis and conflicts of interpretation to which Johannine writings have always been exposed, and should figure amongst the works of reference on the subject.<br>

Abstract: Ouvrage de référence imposant et important, l'Encyclopédie du protestantisme offre des outils d'analyse et de connaissance de la tradition protestante. Venant à la suite de nombreuses autres lectures critiques, la présente étude aborde le projet dans son ensemble avant de parcourir les petites rubriques puis les grands dossiers. A chaque niveau sont alliés la présentation et le regard critique. L'étude se termine par la question centrale de l'ouvrage, celle de l'identité protestante. An imposing and important reference book, the Enyclopédie du protestantisme offers tools for analysing and understanding the protestant tradition. Coming after numerous other critical studies, it begins with an overall view before presenting smaller headings followed by the greater issues. At every level exposition is aligned with criticism. The study ends with the central question of the book, that of Protestant identity.<br>

Abstract: Certains travaux récents de Paul Ricœur montrent un déplacement d'accent : au lieu d'une interrogation sur la fragilité humaine comme dans la Philosophie de la volonté, Ricœur se préoccupe davantage aujourd'hui de la vie, de la natalité, du désir d'accomplissement. Cette dette aristotélicienne trahit-elle l'inspiration que le philosophe avait trouvée dans la tradition biblique ? Même si certains thèmes s'articulent de manière inédite, cet article souligne que la thèse reste inchangée : c'est bien le sujet qu'il faut parvenir à saisir, à la fois dans sa capacité et dans sa fragilité. La référence à Aristote invite alors à jeter un nouveau pont entre la philosophie et la théologie. Certain recent works of Paul Ricoeur show a transition: in the place of human frailty, as in the philosophy of will, Ricœur is more and more occupied today by life, birth, and the desire of accomplishment. Does this Aristotelian debt betray an inspiration that the philosopher had found in Biblical tradition? Even if certain themes are articulated in a new way, the article shows that the same thesis remains: it is still the subject which one must grasp, both in its capacity as in its frailty. So the reference to Aristotle is an invitation to see a new bridge between philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: Pour décrire les moyens dont dispose l'individu pour se constituer en personne (partagée entre l'identité du caractère, l'idem, et le soi plus personnel et moral de l 'ipse), Paul Ricœur, dans Soi-même comme un autre (Paris, Seuil 1990), emprunte aux linguistes deux ensembles conceptuels: les références identifiantes (noms propres) et les actes d'autodésignation du je. Mais, par ce double biais, la pragmatique linguistique conduirait, selon lui, à une impasse, éludant finalement la question du qui? C'est oublier que, dans l'énonciation, le je lui-même acquiert une certaine épaisseur sémantique. Une poésie mimétique d'action comme la poésie lyrique grecque montre le rôle que peut jouer dans la constitution du moi une identité énonciative collective, qui inscrit d'emblée la dialectique entre l'idem et l'ipse dans le rapport avec les autres, sans référence ni métaphysique ni théologique. To describe the means the individual has for establishing personhood (between character identity, the idem, and the more personnel and moral self of the ipse), Paul Ricoeur, in Oneself as Another (English translation 1992), borrows two conceptual ensembles from linguistics: the identifying references (proper nouns) and the self-designating acts of the self. But, according to him, by taking this double bias, linguistic pragmatics leads to an impasse by finally eluding the question "who". This is to forget that in enunciation, the very self acquires a certain semantic depth. A mimetic poetry of action, like Greek lyrical poetry, shows the role that can be played in the constitution of the self by a collectively enunciated identity, which automatically sets the dialectic between the idem and the ipse in relation to others, without metaphysical or theological reference.<br>

Abstract: Les interrogations sur l'éthique minimale sont de trois ordres. Il y a d'abord des divergences dans l'interprétation des grands auteurs de référence, en particulier de Kant et de John Stuart Mill. Il y a ensuite des objections conceptuelles à la critique minimaliste des devoirs moraux envers soi-même. Il y a, enfin, des oppositions aux engagements libéraux de l'éthique minimale en matière de bioéthique entre autres. Les commentaires visent essentiellement à écarter certains malentendus et à évaluer les modifications qu'il faudrait apporter à l'éthique minimale pour qu'elle soulève moins d'objections. The questions put to minimalist ethics are of three types. First there are divergences in the interpretation of the authors of reference, notably of Kant and John Stuart Mill. Then there are conceptual objections to the minimalist criticism of moral obligations to oneself. Finally, there is opposition to the liberal commitments of minimalist ethics to, amongst others matters, bioethics. These comments aim essentially to eliminate certain misunderstandings and to evaluate the necessary modifications so that minimalist ethics would raise fewer objections.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude propose une approche « textologique » du texte scripturaire, à l'interface de la philosophie de la religion et de la philosophie du texte. Elle repose sur deux hypothèses : 1. penser, c'est interroger; la pensée religieuse est une interrogation sur le salut. 2. le sens se textualise en achevant de saturer les trois dimensions de la signifiance (référence, communicabililé, symbolisme). Trois raisons sont données, après le textual turn en philosophie, pour distinguer « texte » et « discours » : structurelle, « érotétique », clause de clôture du Canon des Écritures. Du même coup, le rôle de l'expérience religieuse est dérivé. La méthode est celle de l'analyse conceptuelle des problématiques. This study proposes a "textological" approach to scriptural text, at the interface of the philosophy of religion with the philosophy of the text. It avances two hypothesis: 1. to think is to question; religious thought raises the question of salvation. 2. the meaning textualizes itself by completely saturating the three dimensions of signification (reference, communicabiliiy, symbolism). Three reasons are given, following the textual turn in philosophy, for distinguishing between "text" and "discourse": structure, "erotetics", and the closing clause of the scriptural Canon. At the same time the role of religious experience is explained. The method used is that of the conceptual analysis of problematics.<br>

Article Title: 'Stepping out of the Narrow Frame': Conrad's Suspense and the Novel of Sensation<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i222390<br>
Date: 8 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Moore Susan<br>
Abstract: Critics have associated Conrad's fiction, above all, with a masculinist tradition of writers and philosophers, neglecting his engagement with popular forms of women's writing. Yet in his later work he aimed to reach a female readership of popular novels. This essay explores Conrad's encounter with the female sensation novel, pioneered by such authors as Mary Elizabeth Braddon. Focusing on Conrad's final, posthumously published novel Suspense, the discussion outlines his sensitive response to the narratological structures of the genre, especially Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret. In Suspense, Conrad draws on Braddon's problematic representation of female identity. His reference to the physical enclosure of the heroine, her potential madness, the suggestion of an incest plot, sexual ambivalence, and the presentation of the heroine as a visionary painting all allude to the earlier form. Furthermore, an examination of the serialization of Suspense in the women's pages of Hutchinson's Magazine shows the extent to which Conrad was indebted to sensationalism while also questioning its conventions.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Author(s): Zabus Clive<br>
Abstract: Deconstruction has become a theme in various strands of geographical research. It has not, however, been the subject of much explicit commentary. This paper elaborates on some basic themes concerning the relationship between deconstruction and conceptualizations of context, with particular reference to issues of textual interpretation. The double displacement of textuality characteristic of deconstruction is discussed, followed by a consideration of the themes of 'writing' and 'iterability' as distinctive figures for an alternative spatialization of concepts of context. It is argued that deconstruction informs a questioning of the normative assumptions underwriting the value and empirical identity of context.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Traverso Regina M.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Author(s): Watts Karin R.<br>
Abstract: This paper focuses upon the prevalent complementary definitions of myth and history and questions their analytic utility with reference to literary documents that bespeak the transition between mythic and historic cognition. In the style of ethnosemantic analysis, these definitions are treated as a semantic domain and subjected to formal analysis. The components elicited constitute a new definition - more precisely, a two-dimensional model of the relationship between myth and history. Subsequently, the model is applied to a series of books from the Bible with the conclusion that men and women are structurally equal since, in their roles as social actors, both represent different components of myth as well as history.<br>

Abstract: Hayes frequently uses recombination and assiduously designed constraints to link his poems to those of African American women poets who have preceded him. In
         Hip Logic, he includes as an epigraph a poem “made up of whole and partial lines in the index (underW) ofThe Collected Poems of.”audre lorde
            
               The collection also includes a sonnet entirely made up of the line “We sliced the watermelon into smiles” repeated fourteen times, and several odes. The bulk of the book is made up of a series of poems titled “A Gram of &S,” based on the daily word game found in the puzzle section of newspapers. Hayes explains in a note, “I end each line with one of the eleven words derived from the title word, while abiding by the other rules of the game: 1. Words must be derived from four or more letters. 2. Words that acquire four letters by the addition of ‘s,’ such as ‘bats’ or ‘dies’ are not used. 3. Only one form of a verb is used.”91
            
               In a more recent collection titled92
            Lighthead, Hayes also uses constraints. Reading just the end words of “The Golden Shovel” inLightheadgives the entirety of Gwendolyn Brooks's poem “We Real Cool”:

               Brooks's poem has been literally re-authored, as has Elizabeth Alexander's “Ladders,” which emerges in the end words of Hayes' poem “The Last Train to Africa”Men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.

Abstract: Little engaged with current scholarship in world literature, Apter's book is equally selective in its reference to translation studies. Derrida's work in this area is certainly important, and there is no reason why a problem-centered book would need to survey the full range of translation theory, but Apter neglects major figures whose work could enrich her argument at many points. A broader view of the politics of untranslatability, for example, could supplement Derrida's brief essay “Des tours de Babel” with the hermeneutic theory of George Steiner's
      After Babel(Oxford, 1975). Only cited for a comment on Eleanor Marx's Flaubert translation (283), Steiner could have provided valuable insights on the resistance of language to translation, which he sees as stemming from cultures' desire to protect their “alternities” from outside eyes. At least Steiner gets a passing glance. Apart from a string citation in a single footnote (4),Against World Literaturenowhere discusses or even mentions such seminal figures in the “cultural turn” of contemporary translation studies as Susan Bassnett, André Lefevere, Gideon Toury, Harish Trivedi, or Lawrence Venuti, even though from the 1980s onward these theorists revolutionized a previously formalist field to address issues of power, inequality, and the thorniness of language.<br>

Abstract: Though Jabbeh Wesley is not as demanding of her readers as Levi is of his, her testimonies are no less morally urgent. She too understands the importance of defeating the tyranny of silence. In the poem “Requiem for Auntie,” from the collection
         Becoming Ebony, she takes us through a maze of relationships between the dead and the living. The poem is spoken from the perspective of a little girl observing the body of her aunt. The first stanza begins with a general observation but then quickly narrows to a particular person's experience, to the girl's perspective:
               
            When the dead first arrive in death, their eyes stand
               naked and wide and bare to the bone. This gaze
            
               The reference to nakedness suggests the closure in the dead person's existence; at the same time, it recalls its parallel opposite: the fact that the living still have opportunities. The dead person's gaze constitutes a direct challenge to the girl, who is literally shocked into the realization of her own good fortune at being alive and of the possibilities open to her. In this short, powerful moment, there is an unspoken dialogue between the deceased and the bereaved, between an aunt and her niece; there is a simultaneous negotiation between nakedness and the urgent moral call to clothe that nakedness. The affinity between the dead aunt and her living niece is as much a moment of feminine solidarity as it is a universal experience of sympathy with the weak or with people in pain, as Susan Feagin suggested above. By the end of the poem, the speaker, the little girl, has grown into a woman with a profound sense of responsibility, and she meditates on the mysteries of the world based on, or, inspired by, her original experience as a child:numbed my girl eyes the day they brought my Auntie
               home.
            
               
            The mysteries of this world are not in the living.

Abstract: The 1971 article focused on three major points: (1) Africa as historical reality and religious image; (2) the involuntary presence of the African American community in the United States; and (3) the experience and symbol of God in the experience of blacks; these points overlap. I pointed out how Africa for African Americans was obviously a reference to the continent of Africa but that it was that and more. It became an image and symbol for the possibility for another and alternative beginning and way of being in the world. Africa was indeed a continent with a very large landmass and simultaneously the basis for a powerful orienting discourse about the nature and being of peoples of African descent in the world. The involuntary stance and presence of African people in their diasporic existence in the New World is paralleled by the destruction of aboriginal peoples and acquisition of their lands. These events have prevented any ultimate trust in the rhetorics of egalitarianism and freedom that accompanied the ascendancy of Europe. The manifestation and naming of gods and divine beings as centering symbols of the orientational process express themselves in a precise manner within this situation and become the resource for the maintenance of one's humanity within the context.<br>

Abstract: Another way of evoking the sense in which the person as fundamentally, if not adequately, what “I” refers to as a nonsortal reference is to consider the famous examples of teletransportation, as developed first by Derek Parfit but then marvelously elaborated on by Erich Klawonn, where through a glitch one finds oneself facing absolutely identical twins.
         
                  Initially it is a matter of facing the impossibility of distinguishing the ontological twins. Thus one might be convinced that the Leibnizian claim is false—that if we appear to be confronted with two cases of absolutely identical properties, then either we fail to single out the ultimate distinguishing property (where interchangeable places are not regarded as inherent distinguishing properties) or there is but one being there (a position to which Brentano was inclined). In short, one might well disagree that if there are two beings, there must be given distinguishing properties. But it is quite another thing to face, in the first person, one's, for example, James G. Hart's, ontological clone and have the indubitable blazing insight: “Whoever you are, and by whatever equal right you might have to call yourself James G. Hart, I am not you—and I apperceive you to be convinced that you are not me.” Here who one is, is not determined by properties or sortal determinations, which, by way of generously granting the hypothesis of the thought experiment, are identically the same, that is, have the same properties, in the two cases.31<br>

Abstract: We have already encountered this “wholly different” intentionality in reference to Sartre's analysis of the Look. It is the inverted intentionality in which the tasks of constitution and
            Sinngebungare carried out by the gaze and the voice of the other.
                  The premoral egoism that Levinas calls the same “turns to the absolutely other only on call from the Other.14
               Revelationconstitutes a veritable inversion [of]objectifying cognition” (TI 67).
                  The arrows of intentionality do not emanate from me but come to me from the other. I, my identity, and my responsibility are not legislated by myself but come to me from beyond me. This is why15
               passivityandtranscendenceare such keywords for Levinas. If we say that Kant's ideal of autonomy is the high point of the Enlightenment project, we can say that Levinas is a quintessentially postmodern thinker. Heteronomy is the key to true humanism.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What Seneca does not address is the intense strain hyperbolic impossibility places on the audience/subject as it moves toward its bewildering idealized heights. It “both invites and distances the audience from the height of an apparently unreasonable position” (Webb
         1999, 3). Through a type of “functional ignorance” regarding the incredible, hyperbole emphasizes the limits of figuration in order to disrupt them and to offer a “perspectival mobility” (Ettenhuber2007, 210, 212). Noel Malcolm writes that hyperbole “makes reference to impossible things not because it is trying to describe an impossible world … but as a rhetorical figure, to emphasize and dramatize impossibility itself” (1997, 84). Malcolm stresses that what is important about hyperbole is not that it offers an “impossible world” but that it dramatically (re)presents a world reimagined through impossibility. Hyperbolic impossibility is not an absurdity. It signals and reveals the opening and limits of possibility, and it discloses the implications that impossibility may have for meaning itself.<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Ricoeur's understanding of “appropriation.” One of the advantages of Ricoeur's formulation is that it recognizes the significance of readerly agency while not relying on the idea of a self-possessed subject. Ricoeur argues that appropriation should not be understood as a function of a sovereign subject who “would possess the key” to understanding. Rather, the reader of a text “exchange[s] the
         me,masterof itself, for theself,discipleof the text” (Ricoeur 2007, 37). Such a reader does not project him- or herself onto the text but receives “an enlarged self from the apprehension of proposed worlds which are the genuine object of interpretation” (Ricoeur1981, 182). The ability to perform this function depends on what Ricoeur calls “second-order reference,” which requires the reader to suspend concerns with whether the events “really” happened in order fully to understand the world opening up through her or his imaginative engagement with the text (Ricoeur1977, 216–56).
               This “world of the work” that reveals itself before the text becomes the referent of fictional narrative. When engaged in interpretation, then, the reader should seek to understand this “proposed world” as one “which I could inhabit and in which I could project my ownmost possibilities” (Ricoeur 2007, 36). Fictional narratives, then, ultimately create an imagined world that prepares readers to act their way into it, so to speak. In13
            Time and Narrative, Ricoeur explains that historical narrative employs a related but distinct “referential mode”: whereas fiction refers to an imagined world that could potentially be enacted in front of it, so to speak, historical narrative also claims to refer to an actual world that already exists behind it (1984, 1:82). Ricoeur productively blurs these distinctions inMemory, History, Forgetting, explaining that both types of narrative enable the reader to inhabit the “world of the text” (2004, 262).<br>

Abstract: In this connection, two additional Ricoeurian points are worth emphasizing. First, Shaw does not present incontestable evidence to warrant his assertion that we exit the womb untarnished. And there is a good reason for this omission. No such corroboration exists, either in speculative thought or actual experience. Shaw knows this, even if he does not explicitly cite Kant on the limits of human knowledge. For this reason, he couches his deepest feelings about the sanctity of creation and the purity of nascence in terms of a “frame of reference”
         
               —what we may call faith—without which our lives could easily be an endless nightmare of unrelieved pessimism. Shaw may enlist Paley and the elaborate inner workings of the famous watch to proffer the notion that there is a designer behind all of the intricate design we see in nature, but he is well aware that while argument by analogy is suggestive, it is not necessarily irrefutable.48
            
               After all, given enough time, the counterargument goes, blind chance could have achieved the exact same results many are anxious to attribute to divine intelligence. For Shaw, then, the extrapolated likeness between the maker of a timepiece and the maker of a universe, with respect to complexity, organization, and purpose, does not constitute a rigorous proof. Nevertheless, it does provide him with sufficient grounds for a rational belief in things unseen. Shaw designates his ethereal architect the Life Force and equates it with Will, Spirit, and the mainspring of life, Creative Evolution. On this faith-based view, Shaw defines the Life Force and its ends as the paramount “good” in the ethical sense and conceives every newborn as similarly good because it comes into being already gifted with a subset of the same Will, Spirit, and Creativity that animates the world. From this angle, we can justifiably say that both Ricoeur and Shaw ground their abiding faith and the hope that flows from it in t~<br>

Abstract: This paper presents the background, findings, and implications of a new line of research on the technical identification of linguistic metaphor. Inspired by the cognitive-linguistic approach to metaphor launched by Lakoff and Johnson, a new theoretical framework and operational definition has been developed for the identification of metaphorical expressions in authentic discourse. The paper presents a brief report of two reliability studies of the first stage of the approach, and spells out how it may be applied in linguistic, stylistic and rhetorical text analysis with reference to a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The focus on arts and letters in Marcuse has made him a favorite among literary and cultural critics, and he is inviting to contemporary rhetoricians as well. A rhetorical reading of Marcuse would point out his insistence on the mediated means of communication necessary to convey hope in a future utopia. The engine of social change, one might say, is dependent on a rhetorical, utopian imagination: the art of inventing utopian topics and using them in linguistic, artistic, or architectural works to persuade others in an ethical way to improve and fulfill human desire—rather than pervert it by generating more and more desire for its own sake. In particular, Marcuse's “education of desire” resembles Kenneth Burke's explanation of literary or artistic form as the evocation and fulfillment of desire (more on this presently). There are many ways in which, at first glance, Marcuse's and the other historical theorists' ideas depend on principles of rhetoric, whether they name them as such or not. While there is no consideration of specific rhetorical proofs, reference to utopia itself could be considered a trope or a metaphorical construct. There must always be a consideration of audience in the historical theorists' understanding of points in time and in the transformation of society by means of cultural production and reception. But most strikingly, Marcuse's ethical stance resembles a liberal-humanist mainstay in rhetorical theory, one that stems back to Plato and Aristotle in ancient rhetoric. Rhetoric in the liberal-humanist tradition has always worked hand in hand with considerations of ethics in a human naturist sense. To persuade an audience or to move attitudes in a society, the good of human beings, individual or collective, must be first and foremost in the mind that produces utopian creative output (whether the good is objective or relative). This utopian topos in arts and letters is presented in a way that specifically appeals to, and draws from, the audience, ~<br>

Abstract: Fredric Jameson views Joyce's single-handed construction of “a whole world” as an “image … of a Utopian transformation of human life.”
         
               Jameson's Utopianist notion of construction-as-transformation recalls Morris's dream of the “conscious sensuous pleasure” of all work—when all work is art.68
            
               Yet Jameson stresses that Joyce's work offers merely an image or an illusion of Utopian construction, not a model for progress but a practice immeasurably beyond the power of the vast majority of humankind. However, Jameson appears at first to fail to see that Joyce's work itself already appears aware of this crippling paradox. Jameson views Joyce's work as an “archetypal modernist project”—even goes so far as to offer69
            Ulyssesas “the quickest shorthand reference” to the modernist novel—and thereby linksUlysseswith the “Utopian, anti-middle-class impulses” of high modernism.
               What he fails here to recognize is that70
            Ulyssesis also simultaneously the opposite (or at least the critique) of all this.<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: The key component in the definition of
         Utopiathat distinguishes it fromvisionaryis the requirement that it take up the elaboration, or depiction, of “a perfect social, legal, and political system.” A further definition locatesUtopiasquarely within the province of architecture and urbanism in a way that no definition ofvisionarydoes: “a place, state, or condition ideally perfect in respect of politics, laws, customs, and conditions.” Reference to an “ideally perfect” “place, state,” “condition,” and “customs and conditions” will call to mind architectural or urban settings.
               Instauration of a place and conditions suited to the customs (or habits) of inhabitants persists as a primary aim of architecture, despite the popularity of more visionary, technical, and commercial flourishes. The enduring burden of use that architectural autonomists might like to be free of requires that architects at least attempt to achieve “ideally perfect” settings for the habits buildings or urban settings are intended to situate. Inclusion of10
            idealin definitions ofUtopia, while necessary, creates problems for it:Idealinevitably suggests perfection, and because perfection is impossible, aiming at it appears to implicate Utopia in the dubious belief that perfection might actually be achievable. In this way, Utopia appears a species of hubris, or arrogance, so profound, or profoundly stupid, in its assumptions and attempts at installation that it is beyond redemption, especially in the light of the political and architectural excesses of the twentieth century frequently laid at its doorstep.<br>
