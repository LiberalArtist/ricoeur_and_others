  Book Title: Resentment's Virtue-Jean Amery and the Refusal to Forgive<br>
  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Murphy Jeffrie G.<br>
  Abstract: Resentment's Virtueoffers a new, more nuanced view. Building on the writings of Holocaust survivor Jean Améry and the work of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Thomas Brudholm argues that the preservation of resentment can be the reflex of a moral protest that might be as permissible, humane or honorable as the willingness to forgive. Taking into account the experiences of victims, the findings of truth commissions, and studies of mass atrocities, Brudholm seeks to enrich the philosophical understanding of resentment.<br>

  Abstract: La photographie occupe dans la vie et dans l’esthétique de Michel Butor une place non-négligeable. En fait, son intérêt pour ce médium date de longtemps et, avant d’écrire pour et avec les photographes, il a partagé avec eux l’expérience du déclic¹. On est dans les années 50. Au retour d’un long séjour en Egypte² il commence à prendre beaucoup de photos et pendant une dizaine d’années, lors de ses voyages, il ne se sépare jamais de son reflex en se servant, à l’époque, de ses prises même comme soutien à sa correspondance. Ce sont les premières annonces de celle qui<br>

  Abstract: When the Domination System catches the merest whiff of God’s new order, by an automatic reflex it mobilizes all its might to suppress that order. Even before Jesus experienced its full fury against himself, he apparently predicted the outcome.² The Powers are so immense, the opposition so weak, that every attempt at fundamental change seems doomed to failure. The Powers are seldom content merely to win; they must win overwhelmingly, in order to demoralize opposition before it can gain momentum. Always there is the gratuitous violence, the mocking derision, the intimidating brutality of the means of execution.³ All of this<br>

  Abstract: This paper seeks to explore the social classification and territorial concept of

A reflex of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian territorial category *banua, the word fonua as it is utilised in Tonga intimately connects the people of Tonga with the places that represent Tonga. ¹ Fonua therefore constructs people and place as a bonded entity.<br>

  Abstract: Do frogs jump high because they have great hip extensors? Do they jump high because of some reflex stimulus? In order to experience themselves in the jump? For fun? For food? For protection? Or is the jump an incredible air moment in a dance, a sprightly surprise contrast to unblinking stillness? If this were true, the height of the jump might find its reason in human delight.<br>

  Abstract: In calling perspectivism and multinaturalism an indigenous cosmopolitical theory, I am using the word “theory” by design.
                  36A widespread tendency in the anthropology of the past several decades has consisted in refusing savage thought [la pensée sauvage] the status of a veritable theoretical imagination. What this denial primarily enlightens us about is a certain lack of theoretical imagination on the part of anthropologists.

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Article Title: Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer: Responsibility, Parergon, and Catachresis<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Kant's entire theological project can be read as the setting off of these parerga from the moral core of religion. By contrast, what Coleridge does is return the parerga to the very heart of the subject’s experience: in a sense, he deconstructs, according to the logic of the Derridean supplement, the
         ergon(work) and theparergon(border) of Kant’s religion of reason. For instance, Kant’s moral law stood alone: a moral lawgiver could be inferred, but this inference added very little in justifiable knowledge. Essentially, God became a hypothetical reflex of the moral law, and his nature and even existence was, apart from this context, inscrutable.37Conversely, for Coleridge, responsibility to the moral law is irreducibly personal, and a sense of a personal God is fundamental for responsibility to exist at all. As he writes in the 1825 edition ofAids to Reflection, religion is “the hidden Spring and Fountain‐head of all true Morality,” and it is “impossible to separate the Moral from the Religious.”38A similar reversal occurs with grace. Kant assented that humanity should be able to fulfill the moral law, and yet radical evil meant that they could not. As such, grace is inevitably inscribed as a hope in our moral experience, but one that Kant reduced to a parergon, “wholly transcendent … salutary to hold … at a respectful distance.”39On the other hand, as our initial discussion made clear, humanity’s need for redemption is utterly fundamental to Coleridge: grace is a solecism for the former but the very heart of moral experience for the latter. From what has already been said, the same pattern very clearly applies to prayer: a parergon for Kant, one of the highest necessities of human experience for Coleridge.<br>

Abstract: When I undertook to write this article, my intent was in part to point out the relative silence of the literature outlined above on the topic of evil and pose the question of whether this silence is sustainable. Upon presenting my argument that a critical engagement with the concept of evil is requisite in a cross-culturally valid approach to morality before an audience of anthropologists and other social scientists, I was surprised that the response included considerable apprehension and even resistance. One colleague asserted that evil is a purely mythological concept that should stay that way, and that raising the question of evil is dangerous, like letting a genie out of a bottle. Would it not be safer to substitute the notion of violence, a more value-neutral concept, more easily identified empirically (Das et al.
         2000; Riches1986; Scheper-Hughes and Bourgois2003; Schmidt and Schroeder2001)? Yet violence does not happen by itself—what matters is by whom and against whom it is committed. Moreover, if it is possible to refer, as Derrida does in discussing the human subjection of animals, to “violence in the most morally neutral sense of the term” (2008:25), then what would we name the criterion under which the moral neutrality of violence is abrogated? Another colleague asserted that evil is a metaphysical category and that it is better to focus on material categories such as murder, genocide, torture, rape, and slavery. But as soon as one asks what these forms of abuse have in common, one is hard pressed to find a more precisely descriptive word than evil. In this respect it is less productive to frame the question in terms of an opposition between evil as a metaphysical category and other more material categories than to recognize evil as a general category with specific instances. My point in recalling these objections is that, given their reflex skepticism as to whether a critically refined concept of evil is necessary to understanding morality, the ~<br>

Journal Title: Comparative Literature Studies<br>
Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: At times, poets cite, rewrite, and name other poets as a way to accrue cultural capital to their own texts in a way that is deeply self-conscious of power imbalances. Copying may be considered usurpation, as De Campos argues: “The polytopical polyphonic planetary civilization is, I believe, under the devouring sign of translation
      lato sensu. Creative translation—‘transcreation’—is the most fruitful manner of rethinking Aristotelianmimesiswhich has marked Western poetics so profoundly; of rethinking this concept not as a passive-oriented theory of copy or reflex, but as a usurping impulse in the sense of a dialectic production of differences out of sameness.”
            The poets I am interested in here transcreate: they cut up and recontextualize language of many sorts, play with proper names and mistaken identities, and imagine the cannibal as a figure of resistance to the colonial matrix of power, with its accompanying regime of language and capitalist consumption. Adapting the argument set out by Marcus Boon in his comparative study of the philosophy and cultural theory that underpins copying in the age of globalization,10
         In Praise of Copying, I suggest that various twentieth-century poetic practices of copying articulate a politics that is “not only resistant to the dominant logic of late capitalism, but … [goes] far beyond the banalities of ‘subculture,’ or the disturbing impasses of indigenous cultures that find themselves caught between assimilation and forcible insertion into contemporary IP regimes as commodified signifiers of otherness.”
