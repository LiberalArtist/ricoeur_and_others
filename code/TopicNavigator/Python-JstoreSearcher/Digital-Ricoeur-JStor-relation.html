  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: Whatever the charges of imprecision that might be raised against the concept of “world religions,” there is one feature that religions claiming this title will necessarily share with one another: an explicit sense of their relation to several other religions with prima facie rights to this same claim. The self-understanding of each world religion is constituted in part by its understanding of other world religions. Precisely for Girardian theory, the perceived initial commonality that makes interrelationality and differentiation unavoidable also makes it likely from the start that world religions are not only expressions of how competitive processes internal to each<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters, we have described how the hundred years of conflict between first Zionism and then Israel and the Palestinians has been shaped by the interaction of the symbolic trajectories of Labor and Revisionist Zionism and of the Palestinian people in relation to the events in the world. We now turn to a discussion of their shared symbolic trajectory and an evaluation of their symbolic evolution. At the end of the chapter, we draw implications from the symbolic practices found in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict for Western liberal democratic societies in general and the United States in particular.<br>

  Abstract: AS A MODERN FIELD OF study, Ottoman historiography is unusual, primarily because of its ambivalent relation to that hegemon of hyper-reality, Europe—finding and placing itself both within and without. For much of its existence, the Ottoman Empire was dominated (demographically, economically, politically, ideologically) by its provinces in regions considered now geographically as part of Europe. This is something Ottoman authors oft en remarked upon when discussing the divisions of European geography, which the Well-Protected Domains straddled.<br>

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Book Title: The Cosmic Time of Empire-Modern Britain and World Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Barrows Adam<br>
  Abstract: Combining original historical research with literary analysis, Adam Barrows takes a provocative look at the creation of world standard time in 1884 and rethinks the significance of this remarkable moment in modernism for both the processes of imperialism and for modern literature. As representatives from twenty-four nations argued over adopting the Prime Meridian, and thereby measuring time in relation to Greenwich, England, writers began experimenting with new ways of representing human temporality. Barrows finds this experimentation in works as varied as Victorian adventure novels, high modernist texts, and South Asian novels—including the work of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, H. Rider Haggard, Bram Stoker, Rudyard Kipling, and Joseph Conrad. Demonstrating the investment of modernist writing in the problems of geopolitics and in the public discourse of time, Barrows argues that it is possible, and productive, to rethink the politics of modernism through the politics of time.<br>

  Author(s) Allden Kathleen<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we examine the problem of subjectivity as a transformation of lived experience in the wake of civil warfare and formation of the postcolonial nation-state. The specific terms of subjective alteration—collectively imprinted as a clash of political ethos¹ and personally imprinted as a shattering of identity and sentiment—are considered in relation to a culturally produced anguish in the aftermath of a conflict. Our ethnographic illustration of this process is the well-known case of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.² Prior to this political formation in 1975, multiparty warfare was waged throughout a fractured nation, as anticommunist armies<br>

  Author(s): KLEINMAN ARTHUR<br>
  Abstract: This innovative volume is an extended intellectual conversation about the ways personal lives are being undone and remade today. Examining the ethnography of the modern subject, this preeminent group of scholars probes the continuity and diversity of modes of personhood across a range of Western and non-Western societies. Contributors consider what happens to individual subjectivity when stable or imagined environments such as nations and communities are transformed or displaced by free trade economics, terrorism, and war; how new information and medical technologies reshape the relation one has to oneself; and which forms of subjectivity and life possibilities are produced against a world in pieces. The transdisciplinary conversation includes anthropologists, historians of science, psychologists, a literary critic, a philosopher, physicians, and an economist. The authors touch on how we think and write about contingency, human agency, and ethics today.<br>

  Abstract: To an outside observer, the vernacularization of Europe as a literary-cultural process in itself and, even more so, in relation to political processes appears to be one of the great understudied topics of Western history. The editor of a recent edition of the
                  Oxford History of Medieval Europe, while observing that a major factor in “the new diversity” that marked the late Middle Ages was “the exploitation of a variety of languages in important writings,” confesses himself at a loss to explain the development itself; the origins of the vernacular turn are for him as “mysterious” as its results are<br>

  Book Title: Gadamer’s Repercussions-Reconsidering Philosophical Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Krajewski Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Certainly one of the key German philosophers of the twentieth century, Hans-Georg Gadamer also influenced the study of literature, art, music, sacred and legal texts, and medicine. Indeed, while much attention has been focused on Gadamer's writings about ancient Greek and modern German philosophy, the relevance of his work for other disciplines is only now beginning to be properly considered and understood. In an effort to address this slant, this volume brings together many prominent scholars to assess, re-evaluate, and question Hans-Georg Gadamer's works, as well as his place in intellectual history. The book includes a recent essay by Gadamer on "the task of hermeneutics," as well as essays by distinguished contributors including Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, Gerald Bruns, Georgia Warnke, and many others. The contributors situate Gadamer's views in surprising ways and show that his writings speak to a range of contemporary debates—from constitutional questions to issues of modern art. A controversial final section attempts to uncover and clarify Gadamer's history in relation to National Socialism. More an investigation and questioning than a celebration of this venerable and profoundly influential philosopher, this collection will become a catalyst for any future rethinking of philosophical hermeneutics, as well as a significant starting place for rereading and reviewing Hans-Georg Gadamer.<br>

In terms of proper names this means giving an account of the conceptual symmetries and differences between Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics and Emmanuel Levinas’s ethical theory, which is sometimes called an ethics of alterity or of responsibility, in order to contrast it with subject-centered theories that emphasize thinking and acting in accord with rules, principles, duties, codes, beliefs, teachings, communities, theories of the right and the good, and so on, where to be in accord with such things,<br>

  Author(s) Borneman John<br>
  Abstract: This essay examines the relation of presence in fieldwork to interlocution. Within anthropology in the past several decades, two kinds of criticisms of the fieldwork encounter have had particular resonance: that fieldwork experience and presence do not generate any unique knowledge and that the power/dominance of the (Western) ethnographer ethically taints the knowledge derived from encounters. The questioning of the ethnographer’s presence has frequently led to text-based reading being substituted for fieldwork experience, with a corresponding focus on textual representation; the questioning of the ethnographer’s power has led to demands for collaboration and dialogue, which in turn often emphasize righteous<br>

The purpose is to interrogate temporality as a mode of building ethnic and national communities with an eye to how the category of diaspora is thus turned into a malleable entity. In this way, I seek to contextualize diasporization in Mauritius through practices that shift diasporic allegiances, preventing them from being permanently tied to a certain homeland.

It analyzes the psychological representation and functioning of religious content in the individual. This perspective is useful for revealing and describing aspects of religion that may not be captured otherwise, but obviously it is only one of a universe of perspectives that may be taken with respect to religion, each contributing in a different way to the investigation of the field—but, concurrently, each perspective submitted to specific restrictions.<br>

  Book Title: Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Morgan Daniel<br>
  Abstract: With
      Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema, Daniel Morgan makes a significant contribution to scholarship on Jean-Luc Godard, especially his films and videos since the late 1980s, some of the most notoriously difficult works in contemporary cinema. Through detailed analyses of extended sequences, technical innovations, and formal experiments, Morgan provides an original interpretation of a series of several internally related films-Soigne ta droite(Keep Your Right Up, 1987),Nouvelle vague(New Wave, 1990), andAllemagne 90 neuf zéro(Germany 90 Nine Zero, 1991)-and the monumental late video work,Histoire(s) du cinéma(1988-1998). Taking up a range of topics, including the role of nature and natural beauty, the relation between history and cinema, and the interactions between film and video, the book provides a distinctive account of the cinematic and intellectual ambitions of Godard's late work. At the same time,Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinemaprovides a new direction for the fields of film and philosophy by drawing on the idealist and romantic tradition of philosophical aesthetics, which rarely finds an articulation within film studies. In using the tradition of aesthetics to illuminate Godard's late films and videos, Morgan shows that these works transform the basic terms and categories of aesthetics in and for the cinema.<br>

  Abstract: Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot's mutual interest in the Lascaux cave paintings signals their common concern to construct a discourse of origin in relation to art. Both writers consider origin in terms of the anxiety-filled questioning surrounding the ontological and historical aporias that have plagued Western thought, including those that appear under the banner of the Modern and the Postmodern. Both ask: what kind of discourse presides over the disconcerting doubling of reality performed by the first artists? For Bataille, origin is bound up with the ritual significance of eroticism and death as these underpin all forms of artistic endeavour;<br>

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Abstract: "In the Holocaust novel, silence is always a character, and the word is always its subject matter." So writes David Patterson in this profound and original study of more than thirty important writers. Contrary to existing views, he argues, the Holocaust novel is not an attempt to depict an unimaginable reality or an ineffable horror. It is, rather, an endeavor to fetch the word from silence and restore it to meaning, to resurrect the human soul, to regenerate the relation between the self and God, the self and other, the self and itself.<br>

  Abstract: These passages, both alluded to by Levinas in various places, underscore the impetus of his thought, which argues that ethical responsibility is more fundamental than ontology, inverting twenty-five hundred years of philosophy by showing that “man’s relation to the other is prior to his ontological relation to himself (egology) or to the totality of things that we call the world (cosmology).”¹ Although his work is exceptionally focused in its concern for the other, Levinas’s philosophy is extensive enough that a complete treatment of it is beyond the scope of this project, which demands that we summarize Levinas’s philosophy and focus<br>

  Book Title: The Phenomenology of Prayer-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIRZBA NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: This collection of ground-breaking essays considers the many dimensions of prayer: how prayer relates us to the divine; prayer's ability to reveal what is essential about our humanity; the power of prayer to transform human desire and action; and the relation of prayer to cognition. It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F.

  Author(s) GOODCHILD PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: In “Education and Prayer,” Emmanuel Levinas complains that our prayer has too often become a purely isolated and individuated experience and that we have lost the social and collective dimension of prayer.¹ Prayer, he suggests, always has a liturgical and communal function. Prayer requires openness and truth and hence has ethical significance and import. Jean-Luc Marion is profoundly influenced by Levinas’s philosophy. His own account of prayer bears traces of Levinas’s thought and orients itself along Levinasian suggestions regarding relation to the other. Yet Marion’s account of prayer lacks precisely the communal, social, and ethical dimension for which Levinas calls.<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Abstract: The work of Levinas attempts to give an account of the uniqueness of the human person, starting from what he believes to be peculiar to persons, the recognition of others as the source of moral obligation. This criterion had already been proposed in the literature of neo-Kantianism, but the formulation it received there had been found wanting. According to Heidegger, the neo-Kantian sees in the ethical a means for transcending human finitude: “There is something in the categorical imperative which exceeds the finite being.”¹ But for Heidegger the concept of the ethical can display itself only in relation to a<br>

  Book Title: Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SMITH DAVID NOWELL<br>
  Abstract: Sounding/Silence charts Heidegger's deep engagement with poetry, situating it within the internal dynamics of his thought and within the domains of poetics and literary criticism. Heidegger viewed poetics and literary criticism with notorious disdain: he claimed that his Erlauterungen ("soundings") of Holderlin's poetry were not "contributions to aesthetics and literary history" but rather stemmed "from a necessity for thought." And yet, the questions he poses--the value of significance of prosody and trope, the concept of "poetic language", the relation between language and body, the "truth" of poetry--reach to the very heart of poetics as a discipline, and indeed situate Heidegger within a wider history of thinking on poetry and poetics. opening up points of contact between Heidegger's discussions of poetry and technical and critical analyses of these poems, Nowell Smith addresses a lacuna within Heidegger scholarship and sets off from Heidegger's thought to sketch a philosophical "poetics of limit".<br>

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: I wish here to explore the relation between our desire to exist meaningfully through action and the question that this poses for philosophy. My thesis is simple: We are erotic beings. Our Eros, however, is neither divine nor animal. It is distinctively human: We are beings who seek meaning imaginatively through each other, and the locus of this transformative encounter is the community. This model of human nature contrasts with the dominant view in analytic philosophy of humans as “minds” consisting of “states,” as purely “epistemic subjects” whose primary function is thought to lie in generating propositional claims about the<br>

To perform this task, I will assess how Gabriel Marcel refines his reflective method, especially the dialectical relation between primary reflection and secondary reflection, over the course of his career.

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamenta~<br>

  Abstract: Despite an established but controversial alignment of

The interpretive extremes of this pendulum’s swing are thus conspicuous, but the nature of the pendulum itself seems under taboo. Those aligning a Dantesque or absurdist work withLearhave been interested in such analogous texts primarily as statements of meaning rather than as allegorical forms, that is, as content alone rather than as informed content or as the content of form.

It goes without saying that both “Western” and “Eastern” graphic narratives escape such generalization. However, Angela Moreno Acosta’s redrawing of one sequence from Gene Luen Yang’s American Born Chinese visualizes what has come to dominate the global image of manga, including Groensteen’s, namely the assumption that this kind of comics is particularly qualified for highlighting emotions, moods, and private interpersonal<br>

  Abstract: Before the sense of human presence and its mystery, the continent evaporates, yet also coalesces, regroups into places and times felt, seen, realized—the land itself a presence, a mystery. Faulkner’s imaginative relation to space is much like that of the Hopi Indians defined by Benjamin Lee Whorf in his essay “Time, Space, and Language.” To the Hopis reality is viewed in terms of events (or “eventing”), both objective and subjective. They know no imaginary space, only the actuality, in contrast with the space-concepts of the “English” mind.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k8c">Value and Values</a><br>

  Abstract: One of Buddhism’s central insights is that our conflicts, troubles, and suffering can be positively and sustainably addressed only on the basis of things “as they have come to be” (Skt.

A second insight, and one with powerful contemporary resonances, is that all things arise interdependently. Strongly interpreted, this means that relationality is more basic than “things-related.” Interdependence is not a contingent, external relation among essentially separate entities; it is internal or constitutive. In short, interdependence entails interpenetration. Seeing this is to see that conflicts, troubles,<br>

  Book Title: Building a Heaven on Earth-Religion, Activism, and Protest in Japanese Occupied Korea<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Park Albert L.<br>
  Abstract: Why and how did Korean religious groups respond to growing rural poverty, social dislocation, and the corrosion of culture caused by forces of modernization under strict Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945)? Questions about religion's relationship and response to capitalism, industrialization, urbanization, and secularization lie at the heart of understanding the intersection between colonialism, religion, and modernity in Korea. Yet, getting answers to these questions has been a challenge because of narrow historical investigations that fail to study religious processes in relation to political, economic, social, and cultural developments. In
      Building a Heaven on Earth, Albert L. Park studies the progressive drives by religious groups to contest standard conceptions of modernity and forge a heavenly kingdom on the Korean peninsula to relieve people from fierce ruptures in their everyday lives. The results of his study will reconfigure the debates on colonial modernity, the origins of faith-based social activism in Korea, and the role of religion in a modern world.<br>

  Abstract: Olivier Messiaen is mentioned in many a twentieth-century survey in relation to the role he had in serialism. Around 1950 he was seen as a forerunner in the field of conceptual and technical innovations in music. During this brief period he produced works with often purely technical titles that to all appearances did not refer to religion. But although these works may possess an implicit religious meaning, as some authors have pointed out, Messiaen’s overall oeuvre—on paper, in any case—is emphatically determined by the many works with explicit religious titles, themes, and mottos.¹<br>

Develops the approaches to subjectivity, aesthetics, music and language in relation to new theoretical developments bridging the divide between the continental and analytical traditions of philosophy.

Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage. A red thread connecting these essays is the character of the triune God who is the energy and life in between all things.<br>

  Abstract: No longer do we Australians live in a monochrome religious culture, if we ever truly did. Today, more than ever, we are aware of the rich tapestry of religions present in our culture. In this new context the question of Christian identity assumes a new and urgent importance and finds expression in, among other things, a concern to articulate the uniqueness of the gospel. A particular difficulty with this task today is that it has to be executed in relation to efforts by those of other faiths to clarify their own religious identity. Self-consciousness of this religious context is not<br>

On the one hand, the preposition “til,” “to,” indicates a relation between subjectivity and otherness that, Kierkegaard maintains, cannot be subsumed within the sphere of being or essence. On the other hand, while agreeing with Kierkegaard’s denial, Levinas argues against Kierkegaard (and Heidegger) that the ec-static, ex-sistent to-ness and toward-ness of the relation indicated by Kierkegaard’s preposition presupposes an inward-ness without which there can be<br>

What is the connection between violence and my relation to the other? How can the motives behind violence be understood, and how is it entangled with religion? Levinas’s understanding of how violence is bound up with the face of the other provides a rich phenomenological account, one that I believe can be supplemented with Cavell’s subtle understanding of its motivation.<br>

  Author(s) Neville Robert Cummings<br>
  Abstract: As a theory of action, classical pragmatism—founded by the scientifically trained philosophers Charles S. Peirce and William James in New England—is also always a philosophy of religion. Human experience is not (as in the German tradition) divided according to practical experience, on the one hand, and scientific empiricism, on the other. Instead, it is precisely the interplay of belief in relation to action that explains our everyday behavior as much as the scientific method and religious experience. While different conceptions of god have inevitably resulted from the latter over time, the images, narratives, and symbols are nonetheless comparable.<br>

  Book Title: Exodus and Resurrection-The God of Israel in the Theology of Robert W. Jenson<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Nicol Andrew W.<br>
  Abstract: Exodus and Resurrection establishes the important place God’s identity as the “God of Israel" has in the systematic theology of Robert W. Jenson. The work demonstrates that the identification of the God of Israel as the agent of Jesus’ resurrection functions as a foundational premise in Jenson’s Trinitarian theology. Andrew W. Nicol argues that a central characteristic of Jenson’s work is not merely his recognition that the same God who rescued Israel from Egypt raised Jesus from the dead, or the related yet distinct step of renovating his theology in a nonsupersessionist fashion, but also his attempt to conceive of the full implications for doing so in Christian theology, in the church’s self-understanding, and in the church’s relation to Israel and continuing Judaism. In this, Exodus and Resurrection provides a clear and critically appreciative account of Robert W. Jenson’s work and offers a new vital architectonic map of Jenson’s systematic vision.<br>

  Abstract: These questions cut to the very heart of Jenson’s theology. In the words of Brevard Childs, “For the Christian church the continuing paradox of its faith lies in its encounter through the Jewish Scriptures with the selfsame divine presence it confesses to have found in the face of Jesus Christ.”³ Insofar as Jenson’s biblical hermeneutic judges the God of Israel to be crucial to the identification of this one God, this identification is simultaneously Trinitarian. Moreover, his influential contribution to the revival of Trinitarian theology is implicitly reliant on a dynamic account of Jesus’ relation to the God of Israel.<br>

  Book Title: Le bal des arts-Le sujet et l’image : écrire avec l’art<br>
  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Rolla Chiara<br>
  Abstract: Aujourd’hui, les frontières des formes artistiques tendent à devenir de plus en plus indéfinissables sous l’effet d’une intense activité de circulation, d’hybridation et de métissage conduisant à la naissance de nouveaux régimes de la création et à la composition d’oeuvres complexes et multiples. Les textes littéraires n’échappent pas à cette transformation mettant en scène de nouveaux paradigmes de lecture et de signification par l’expérimentation d’autres manières de dire la réalité, de raconter des histoires, de se poser face au monde. Le sujet, son statut et les modalités de sa présence dans les oeuvres littéraires qui entretiennent une relation avec les autres arts, sont autant d’axes privilégiés dans ce volume. En transgressant les frontières entre les arts, les oeuvres donnent à voir et à penser des univers de signification et de représentation élargis devant lesquels le sujet bénéficie en retour d’un accroissement de ses capacités de compréhension et d’invention. Dans ces textes la communication entre les différentes formes artistiques se trouve mise en jeu au point qu’il ne suffit plus de la définir en termes d’hybridation, et qu’il convient peut-être mieux d’y réfléchir en termes d’intermédialité. Le présent volume reprend ces thématiques de recherche et ces interrogations ; il les approfondit et les développe en déchiffrant des pratiques d’écriture contemporaines qui entretiennent des rapports étroits avec les arts et les techniques de l’image. Les mises au point théoriques et méthodologiques côtoient des analyses pointues et des propositions d’interprétation de phénomènes nouveaux et encore peu définis par la critique.<br>

  Book Title: Crossing the Rubicon: The Borderlands of Philosophy and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shank Reuben<br>
  Abstract: In France today, philosophy--phenomenology in particular--finds itself in a paradoxical relation to theology. Some debate a "theological turn." Others disavow theological arguments as if such arguments would tarnish their philosophical integrity, while nevertheless carrying out theology in other venues. In Crossing the Rubicon, Emmanuel Falque seeks to end this face-off. Convinced that "the more one theologizes, the better one philosophizes," he proposes a counterblow by theology against phenomenology. Instead of another philosophy of "the threshold" or "the leap"--and through a retrospective and forward-looking examination of his own method--he argues that an encounter between the two disciplines will reveal their mutual fruitfulness and their true distinctive borders. Falque shows that he has made the crossing between philosophy and theology and back again with audacity and perhaps a little recklessness, knowing full well that no one thinks without exposing himself to risk.<br>

  Book Title: The Adventures of Jonathan Dennis-Bicultural Film Archiving Practice in Aotearoa New Zealand<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelly Emma Jean<br>
  Abstract: Jonathan Dennis (1953-2002), was the creative and talented founding director of the New Zealand Film Archive. As a Pakeha (non-Maori/indigenous New Zealander) with a strong sense of social justice, Dennis became a conduit for tension and debate over the preservation and presentation of indigenous and non-indigenous film archival materials from the time the Archive opened in 1981. His work resulted in a film archive and curatorship practice which differed significantly from that of the North American and European archives he originally sought to emulate. He supported a philosophical shift in archival practice by engaging indigenous peoples in developing creative and innovative exhibitions from the 1980s until his death, recognizing that much of the expertise required to work with archival materials rested with the communities outside archival walls. This book presents new interviews gathered by the author, as well as an examination of existing interviews, films and broadcasts about and with Jonathan Dennis, to consider the narrative of a life and work in relation to film archiving.<br>

  Book Title: Early Cinema and the "National"-  Publisher: John Libbey Publishing<br>
  Author(s): King Rob<br>
  Abstract: While many studies have been written on national cinemas, Early Cinema and the "National" is the first anthology to focus on the concept of national film culture from a wide methodological spectrum of interests, including not only visual and narrative forms, but also international geopolitics, exhibition and marketing practices, and pressing linkages to national imageries. The essays in this richly illustrated, landmark anthology are devoted to reconsidering the nation as a framing category for writing cinema history. Many of the 34 contributors show that concepts of a national identity played a role in establishing the parameters of cinema's early development, from technological change to discourses of stardom, from emerging genres to intertitling practices. Yet, as others attest, national meanings could often become knotty in other contexts, when concepts of nationhood were contested in relation to colonial/imperial histories and regional configurations. Early Cinema and the "National" takes stock of a formative moment in cinema history, tracing the beginnings of the process whereby nations learned to imagine themselves through moving images.<br>

  Abstract: The notion of French exceptionalism is at the heart of French political discourse and culture. Yet it sits in an uneasy alliance with another concept, equally central to the dominant French republican ideology – that of universalism. This chapter explores the contradictions constituting the couplet exceptionalism/universalism, with particular reference to discourses articulating relations between France and its present and former colonies. It will look at the evolution of these discourses, as well as examine contemporary shifts and modifications in relation to what is known as the francophone world.<br>

  Abstract: The war for Algerian independence (1954–62) was bloody and protracted, fought ruthlessly on both sides, but with the defenders of French rule lapsing into the worst savageries of torture and mass repression. Like the Vietnam War for the United States a decade later, it tore through the very fabric of French society, and destroyed the fragile institutions of the Fourth Republic, bringing de Gaulle to power in 1958. Sartre again found himself in a triangular relation with the PCF and the anti-Stalinist left. Above all, the war led to a profound and lasting radicalisation of Sartre’s position.<br>

  Book Title: The Idea of Wilderness-From Prehistory to the Age of Ecology<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OELSCHLAEGER MAX<br>
  Abstract: Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, and idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the unprecedented concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to "modernism" arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America's two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.<br>

Grice observed that speakers in conversation seem to observe this maxim, both in speaking and in interpreting, and that it is this ‘unspoken agreement’ which allows communication to take place, despite the indeterminacy of reference which is characteristic of language.

  Abstract: Religion is the deeply human enterprise of evaluating and interpreting self and others based on what concerns one ultimately. religion simultaneously gives one an image of whom one is meant to be and of a society that promotes this realization in and for others. in other words, religion puts forth a utopic image—the image of a complete human life in relation to culture, society, and civilization as a whole. it is the work of the theologian to engage the changing narratives of religion in order to promote religion’s capacity to work continuously toward this utopic vision of human flourishing.<br>

  Author(s) Clements E. Anne<br>
  Abstract: New Testament scholar Duling, using the work of others in the social sciences, defines four different concepts of marginality, which he then applies to antiquity particularly in relation to Matthew’s Gospel. The first and most commonly recognized form of marginality is structural marginality. Structural marginality refers “to structural inequities in the social system: some persons are in the center and some are on the periphery.” Duling refers to this as
                  involuntary marginality. Such individuals aren’t able to participate in normative social statuses, their roles and duties. As a result they can’t access the material and nonmaterial resources available to those<br>

Next, the sexual person will be studied as a realm of concrete problems for the body; and finally the problem of the body will be explored in light of Jean-Luc Marion’s thought, who crosses the boundaries between philosophy and theology.

The inseparability of the gifted unity of being from the question of time arose through the examination of the gratuity of the gift: the entryway to the meaning of being’s time and eternity.Pondering God’s own gratuity revealed that the tri-hypostatic being is one precisely because God is eternal, ever-fruitful beginning. Eternity is the tri-hypostatic gift that is simple, perfect, self-subsistent, and ever-fruitful beginning. We also arrived at the relation between being and time<br>

Others (Hamilton, Salusinszky, Adamson, Wang) have strongly argued Frye’s importance as both contributor and challenger to these schools.

Political theology concerns itself with the political and broadly social aspects of this. Theology, as the editors of

Several central themes of his theology are based on his use of the category of relation, such as his theology of the Trinity (the divine person as subsistent relation), creation (the relation of God to the world), and the Incarnation (the relation of the divine and the human natures in Christ). Relation receives attention of a philosophical and a theological order.¹ The philosophical approach is well attested in Aquinas’s commentaries on the

  Book Title: Comparing Faithfully-Insights for Systematic Theological Reflection<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: Every generation of theologians must respond to its context by rearticulating the central tenets of the faith. Interreligious comparison has been integral to this process from the start of the Christian tradition and is especially salient today. The emerging field of comparative theology, in which close study of another religious tradition yields new questions and categories for theological reflection in the scholar's home tradition, embodies the ecumenical spirit of this moment. This discipline has the potential to enrich systematic theology and, by extension, theological education, at its foundations. This resource for pastors and theology students reconsiders five central doctrines of the Christian faith in light of focused interreligious investigations. The dialogical format of the book builds conversation about the doctrine of God, theodicy, humanity, Christology, and soteriology. Its comparative essays span examples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Jain, and Confucian traditions, indigenous Aztec theology, and contemporary "spiritual but not religious" thought, to offer exciting new perspectives on Christian doctrine. The essays in this volume demonstrate that engagement with religious diversity need not be an afterthought in the study of Christian systematic theology; rather, it can be a way into systematic theological thinking. Each section invites students to test theological categories, to consider Christian doctrine in relation to specific comparisons, and to take up comparative study in their own contexts.<br>

  Abstract: Human beings respond to difference, especially religious difference, in varying ways. Some people are repulsed by religious difference and attempt to insulate themselves from it. Others are fascinated by difference and see it as an opportunity to learn more about “the other”—the one who is different from us, the one who is not “the same”—and about themselves. For these people, otherness provides an opportunity to compare, which is a powerful means of insight. For example, democracy is understood in relation to dictatorship, freedom is understood in relation to slavery, and prosperity is understood in relation to poverty. So,<br>

  Book Title: La transformation sociale par l'innovation sociale-  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): Roy Matthieu<br>
  Abstract: Les innovations sociales, à la manière de bougies d’allumage, engendrent des actions collectives qui proposent des solutions différentes de celles des pratiques dominantes en mettant l’économie au service des personnes et de la société. Or la simple multiplication des innovations sociales ne peut générer la transformation sociale à elle seule. La mise en relation des mouvements sociaux et de leur visée émancipatoire est nécessaire pour façonner de nouvelles normes et règles et mettre en place de nouveaux sentiers institutionnels. Ce sont certains de ces nouveaux sentiers que montrent les textes regroupés dans cet ouvrage. Fruit du ive Colloque international du Centre de recherche sur les innovations sociales, il expose les enjeux que pose la trans-formation sociale par l’innovation sociale et les documente par des illustrations ciblées sur des thématiques ou des expériences précises. Une discussion théorique sur le lien entre l’innovation sociale et la transformation sociale est d’abord proposée, puis les méthodes d’analyse de l’innovation sociale, le partage de connaissance entre les chercheurs et les acteurs sociaux, le rôle de l’État et des politiques publiques, l’économie solidaire et la place de l’entreprise sociale sont abordés. L’ensemble des textes analytiques et des textes illustratifs de cet ouvrage offre des pistes de réflexion sur la transformation sociale par l’inno-vation sociale, c’est-à-dire sur la façon dont certaines expérimen-tations aboutissent à la transformation de la société. L’ouvrage met ainsi de l’avant le rôle des citoyens et des organisations qui travaillent pour le bien-être des collectivités en expérimentant des solutions à leurs problèmes et en se mobilisant pour exiger leur reconnaissance. Il vise à poser les jalons pour comprendre et participer à la reconstruction sociale déjà à l’œuvre, dans le but de la renforcer.<br>

In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal ~<br>

  Abstract: From the first, Marx’s theory of commodity and money fetishism formed one of the most admired and contested aspects of his “critique” of political economy. In an astonishing fashion, it restores the correlation of sovereignty and subjection to the heart of the modern “social relation” that appears to herald the triumph of free individuality. To this end, it was necessary conceptually to reinscribe the classical schema of the “contract” into the representative and practical space of commodity exchange, whose immediacy he explodes by showing its latent metaphysics, which is also an anthropology and a politics.

Taylor tells us that ‘from the beginning, the number one problem of modern social science has been modernity itself: that historically unprecedented amalgam of new practices and institutional forms (science, technology, industrial production, urbanization), of new ways of living (individualism, secularization, instrumental rationality); and of new forms of malaise (alienation, meaninglessness,<br>

This work does not present a systematic treatise on positive or natural theology but is rather a long series of polemical arguments, the whole of which constitutes a plea for the goodness of God: “it is the case of God that we plead.”² Bayle is the principal prosecutor, and Leibniz takes the defense of the accused, in full confidence that “the assistance of God is not lacking to those who do not lack good will.”<br>

Taking up Arendt’s notions of action and her criticism of privatization, the author examines community, relation, and human subjects through the work of Bonhoeffer and Stăniloae. Synthesizing Bonhoeffer and Stăniloae, Christian calling is unfolded not only as acting for others, but also with others as Trinitarian participatory response—response to the words and deeds of the three divine Persons acting in communion.<br>

  Abstract: The present paper aims at investigating — both theoretically and in the context of the Early Mycenaean period in mainland Greece (Table 26.1) — the relation of funerary rituals with processes of shaping, negotiating and transmitting collective identities. In particular, I wish to explore the role of specially designated ritual spaces (in this case, the

In this effort, I will draw extensively on anthropological literature examining rituals as public performances.

  Abstract: How might the teaching of psychoanalysis and, in particular, the teaching of psychoanalytic interpretations of Shakespeare be made more visible and effective in American colleges and universities? On this point it is tempting simply to paraphrase Lacan and say that there is no academic relation. A nominal adjective like “Freudian” can—and does—cover a multitude of (largely inaccurate) sins, but “Kleinian” and “Kohutian” are not part of the undergraduate vocabulary, nor, so far as I can tell, are names like Winnicott, Bion, Bowlby, or Kernberg.<br>

  Abstract: The enigma of the work of modern art is also the name for its constitutive character. The character of this self-contradicting existence is what makes the work of art into the occasion for a baffling and befuddling encounter. The complement to enigma in the work of art is its truth content. Key to engaging the work of art’s enigma and truth content is the mimetic relation between experience and the work of art. The misalignment between the work of art and human experience is an opportunity for encountering what exists as objective contradiction. The ongoing dance between the mimetic misalignments<br>

  Abstract: An anthropological investigation into philosophy can provide us with insights and information about traditions of knowledge and intellectual practice elsewhere in the world, in social contexts very different from our own. The project needs to engage with – and first of all be able to identify – philosophy as part of social discourse, and as a social practice, within any given region. Here, I am carving out one particular approach about how this could work, in relation to the Swahili context and against the background of discussions in African philosophy. Philosophy, as socialized discourse and practice, overlaps with other (more established) areas<br>

  Book Title: Light and Death-Figuration in Spenser, Kepler, Donne, Milton<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: Separated by centuries, but united by their faith, and a certain kind of idiosyncratic genius, both Evagrius of Pontus and Søren Kierkegaard developed the traditional concept of “the soul” within anthropologies grounded in their dynamic metaphysics. Each posited a tripartite composition of the human being, consisting of body, mind/soul, and soul/spirit. Despite the variable terminology used by the thinkers (and their translators), both employed a “third term” to designate the relation between the person’s corporeal and incorporeal aspects: a relation that is, itself, constitutive of the character of one’s being and a litmus test for one’s moral and spiritual health.<br>

  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new.

  Abstract: Joyce scholars have always been interested in situating Joyce in historical context, but only since the late 1980s has the “Joyce and History” formulation become central. In part, this turn toward “history” has been philosophical. Less concerned with Joyce as a historical subject, the American academy in the 1980s and early 1990s produced a Joyce engaged with the subject of history—that is with history as historiography. Such critics as Robert Spoo and James Fairhall, then, constructed a Joyce preoccupied with history as ideological formation, particularly in relation to the orthodoxies of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historiography (Fairhall 1993;<br>

  Abstract: Any account of the relation between myth and literature has a responsibility first to define “myth.” And there, with historical stubbornness, lies not merely a problem, but perhaps the entire subject of myth studies. On the one hand, there is a question as to what myths actually refer to, since they have come to mean many things, from primitive and sacred ritual to propaganda and ideological statements. On the other, there is a good deal of confusion and conflicting argument over how to define the significance of myth. Is it primarily a matter of thematics, or form, or function—or<br>

  Abstract: Si l’on considère le rapport entre l’incohérence et la littérature, si l’on essaye de lire un texte en fonction de cette relation, on s’aperçoit que l’une des formes que l’incohérence assume est celle de la rupture. À mieux regarder, il semble clair qu’il s’agit d’une déviation du parcours cohérent de l’écriture, qui a le but de déclencher le mécanisme de « l’intéressant », élément nécessaire pour que la narration puisse démarrer. Afin de mieux comprendre ce phénomène, on pourrait imaginer une dimension antérieure au texte littéraire, qui se présenterait comme un terrain linéaire et sans aspérités.

  Albert Memmi’s Desert of Allegory in The Pillar of Salt from:

  Abstract: The Cleveland Museum of Art houses one of the most challenging treatments of the Sodom story in twentieth-century visual culture, Anselm Kiefer’s multimedia work
                  Lots Frau(plate 1). It is easy to miss the pale script spelling out “Lots Frau” in the painting’s lower right-hand corner; yet, without it, the work hardly bears relation to either Sodom’s biblical account or the art-historical archive. The inscription supplies only minimal clues, just enough so that the railway tracks and the postapocalyptic landscape eventually prompt recognition of the Sodom story’s generic narrative elements—the drama of exile, the specter of annihilation.

  Abstract: Romanticism can and has been criticized, and these criticisms also apply to technoromanticism. I start by enumerating some of them. First, technoromanticism may lead to escape to a different reality, create distance, and constitute a disengaged relation to the (real) environment. Since the new worlds of games, films, and virtual realities are so immersive, this seems to come at the expense of engagement with “this” world. Second, technoromanticism may lead to self-absorption and narcissism: insofar as romantic use of technologies such as the Internet and smartphones enables retreat in our fantastic inner, private world where we find harmony and can<br>

A particularly difficult problem has been the relation of 1 Corinthians 10:1–22 to the rest of chapters 8–10. In these verses Paul appears to adopt an absolute prohibition of contact with pagan cults, but that accords ill with his more lenient stand in chapter 8 and in 10:23–31. Moreover, the sequence of thought in 10:1–22 has not been completely clear, either. How are the scriptural examples connected with the paraenetic warnings?

  Book Title: Engaging the Moving Image-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Carroll Noël<br>
  Abstract: Noël Carroll, a brilliant and provocative philosopher of film, has gathered in this book eighteen of his most recent essays on cinema and television-what Carroll calls "moving images." The essays discuss topics in philosophy, film theory, and film criticism.Drawing on concepts from cognitive psychology and analytic philosophy, Carroll examines a wide range of fascinating topics. These include film attention, the emotional address of the moving image, film and racism, the nature and epistemology of documentary film, the moral status of television, the concept of film style, the foundations of film evaluation, the film theory of Siegfried Kracauer, the ideology of the professional western, and films by Sergei Eisenstein and Yvonne Rainer. Carroll also assesses the state of contemporary film theory and speculates on its prospects. The book continues many of the themes of Carroll's earlier work
      Theorizing the Moving Imageand develops them in new directions. A general introduction by George Wilson situates Carroll's essays in relation to his view of moving-image studies.<br>

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

  Book Title: Precarious Visualities-New Perspectives on Identification in Contemporary Art and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects.

Vision came to be systematically understood as an act conditioned by culture, social class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and geography.

Such narratives generally reflect the dominant discourse and accepted range of meanings in relation to socially defined roles.

  Abstract: Anthropology’s venerable and unusual tradition of self-critique addresses its complicity with colonialism and has sought, moreover, to periodically reconstitute its political relevance by addressing social inequality worldwide (Asad 1980[1973]; Hymes 1969). Toward this end, anthropologists have absorbed the critical insights from allied disciplines and the broad parameters of nonpositivistic critique. One only has to think of Marx or the numerous anthropologists who have been influenced by the Frankfurt School and the multiple contemporary currents of Continental social theory more generally.

  Abstract: Cet ouvrage innovateur et unique cristallise l'état actuel de la réflexion sur le témoignage de foi chrétienne dans les médias. Les conférenciers provenant d'universités, de médias et de diverses sphères religieuses et professionnelles, donnent à l'ouvrage une dimension interreligieuse et multiculturelle très riche. Être témoin de foi chrétienne, qu'est-ce à dire ? Le livre explicite d'abord le témoignage tel que vécu par les chrétiens de la primitive Église et par les croyants et croyantes d'aujourd'hui. Puis, l'ouvrage tente de discerner la relation proprement dite entre le témoignage de foi chrétienne et les médias : qui sera témoin ? de quoi ? où ? quand ? comment ? à cause de quoi ? en vue de quoi ? et avec quelles conséquences pour les religions ? Somme toute, y a-t-il compatibilité ou incompatibilité entre médias et foi ? Certains intervenants remettent en cause des aspects de cette présence, d'autre l'acceptent conditionnellement, bon nombre y croient fermement, et même jusqu'à prôner le côté révolutionnaire de médias religieux parallèles dans le contexte mercantile actuel. Voilà un matériau de réflexion complètement neuf, qui ouvre des perspectives inédites sur la présence de la foi chrétienne en pleine culture médiatique du XXIe siècle.<br>

  Abstract: The Vél’ d’Hiv’ and Holocaust Monument are examples of a new kind of war memorial. They commemorate neither military victory nor glorious defeat, customary following national campaigns of the nineteenth century and following the First World War, but war crimes. Consequently, there is no all-embracing notion that captures either the style or function of contemporary monuments. Several existent terms, such as ‘ephemeral’ or ‘objectless’ monuments, pinpoint essential formal features of monumental art, but are normative and partial (see Introduction). Other concepts have pinpointed the reactive function of monuments in relation to existing monuments and traditions, including ‘counter-monuments’ and monuments erected<br>

  Book Title: The Forgiveness to Come-The Holocaust and the Hyper-Ethical<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berkowitz Roger<br>
  Abstract: Accompanied by Jacques Derrida's thought of forgiveness of the unforgivable, and its elaboration in relation to crimes against humanity, the book undertakes close readings of literary, philosophical, and cinematic texts by Simon Wiesenthal, Jean Améry, Vladimir Jankélévitch, Robert Antelme and Eva Mozes Kor. These texts contend with the idea that the crimes of the Nazis are inexpiable, that they lie beyond any possible atonement or repair. Banki argues that the juridical concept of crimes against humanity calls for a thought of forgiveness-one that would not imply closure of the infinite wounds of the past. How could such a forgiveness be thought or dreamed? Banki shows that if today we cannot simply escape the "worldwidization" of forgiveness, then it is necessary to rethink what forgiveness is, the conditions under which it supposedly takes place, and especially its relation to justice.<br>

In order to understand this twist, however, it is necessary to approach from afar, for it originates in one of Nietzsche’s aphorisms: “The heroic consists in doing a great thing (or in not doing a thing in a great fashion) without feeling oneself to be in competition with others before others. The hero always bears the wilderness and the sacred, inviolable borderline within him wherever he may go” (Nietzsche,

  Abstract: In a lecture presented at the Library of Congress in 1948, T. S. Eliot acknowledges so early an acquaintance with Poe that he cannot be sure whether his own work has been influenced by him. He then distances himself from his predecessor by focusing on Poe’s relation to the French Symbolists Baudelaire, Mallarmé, and Valéry.¹ This detour through another country and another language is the standard reading of the Eliot-Poe connection: Poe’s insistence on the poem as a formal artifact, as well as his critical self-consciousness, influenced the French Symbolists, who in turn influenced Eliot. Clearly, Eliot shares the Symbolists’<br>

  Abstract: Any cognitive psychology of dreaming must encounter and reconcile two statements: “the dream is a story” and “the dream is imagery.” Neither statement is as obvious as it initially appears, I I because there is no agreement in contemporary cognitive psychology on the ultimate relation between visual-spatial imagery and language. Much evidence and theory supports both the view that a visual-spatial imagistic intelligence rests directly on and creatively reorganizes the processes of perception and the view that mental imagery is a surface paraphrase of abstract propositional knowledge, whose deep structure is accordingly far closer to verbal syntax than visual imagery.<br>

The foundation was Langevin’s practical way of expressing his commitment to a culturally dual French-English vision of Canada, and of addressing his fears of Anglicization, which were heightened after the Manitoba government withdrew financial support for confessional schools in 1890.

  Book Title: Self-Understanding and Lifeworld-Basic Traits of a Phenomenological Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

  Book Title: The Spirits of Crossbones Graveyard-Time, Ritual, and Sexual Commerce in London<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hausner Sondra L.<br>
  Abstract: Every month, a ragtag group of Londoners gather in the site known as Crossbones Graveyard to commemorate the souls of medieval prostitutes believed to be buried there-the "Winchester Geese," women who were under the protection of the Church but denied Christian burial. In the Borough of Southwark, not far from Shakespeare's Globe, is a pilgrimage site for self-identified misfits, nonconformists, and contemporary sex workers who leave memorials to the outcast dead. Ceremonies combining raucous humor and eclectic spirituality are led by a local playwright, John Constable, also known as John Crow. His interpretation of the history of the site has struck a chord with many who feel alienated in present-day London. Sondra L. Hausner offers a nuanced ethnography of Crossbones that tacks between past and present to look at the historical practices of sex work, the relation of the Church to these professions, and their representation in the present. She draws on anthropological approaches to ritual and time to understand the forms of spiritual healing conveyed by the Crossbones rites. She shows that ritual is a way of creating the present by mobilizing the stories of the past for contemporary purposes.<br>

  Abstract: In a 1988 interview, Levinas claims that the “essential theme of my research is the deformalization of the notion of time” (OUJ 232). At first glance, this identification of time as his “essential theme” seems counterintuitive, given his steadfast focus on the nature of responsibility and the subject’s relation to alterity. However, how we understand time shapes how we understand the self, and Levinas argues that a formal conception of time supports the modern ideal of autonomous subjectivity.

While Marcel’s theatre — and indeed some of his philosophical writings — have been shown to engage with this aspect of alterity, his philosophical project cannot simply be confined to this because, as Marcel’s narrations of his plays reinforce, he is also concerned with the self in action — that is, with the basis on which the self might make decisions, and in what light (‘authentic’ or otherwise) these<br>

Such assumptions are not new. History presents some strong supporting evidence for their validity, but also raises questions, particularly in relation to equity in resource distribution.

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

This concern is evident in both wings of the two major contemporary philosophical movements, which are popularly if inaccurately designated as the analytical and the continental or phenomenological schools.

  Book Title: On the Nature of Consciousness-Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUNT HARRY T.<br>
  Abstract: What is the relation between mystical experience and ordinary consciousness, between the principles of modern physics and the patterns of perception in all moving creatures, between our human self-consciousness and the more primary sentience of protozoa? This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuro-psychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various "new age" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.<br>

  Abstract: The novels of Paul Auster-finely wrought, self-reflexive, filled with doublings, coincidences, and mysteries-have captured the imagination of readers and the admiration of many critics of contemporary literature. In
      Beyond the Red Notebook, the first book devoted to the works of Auster, Dennis Barone has assembled an international group of scholars who present twelve essays that provide a rich and insightful examination of Auster's writings. The authors explore connections between Auster's poetry and fiction, the philosophical underpinnings of his writing, its relation to detective fiction, and its unique embodiment of the postmodern sublime. Their essays provide the fullest analysis available of Auster's themes of solitude, chance, and paternity found in works such asThe Invention of Solitude,City of Glass,Ghosts,The Locked Room,In the Country of Last Things,Moon Palace,The Music of Chance, andLeviathan. This volume includes contributions from Pascal Bruckner, Marc Chenetier, Norman Finkelstein, Derek Rubin, Madeleine Sorapure, Stephen Bernstein, Tim Woods, Steven Weisenburger, Arthur Saltzman, Eric Wirth, and Motoyuki Shibata.

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

As I have argued, the claim to alien status is a relational one, drawing a boundary that defines an outside in relation to an inside. In the traditional valorization of the alien topos (as seen in 1 Peter, Hebrews, and 
                  Diognetus), outsider and insider terms get reversed, so that, by claiming the name “alien,” Christians mark their insider status with a revalued language of alterity. But because of this relational dynamic, small differences in emphasis could produce<br>

                  Perlmann’s Silenceby Pascal Mercier (2007 [1995]), things have lost their “presence.” He seems only capable of fully experiencing life when remembering it, and he clings hopelessly to the sentences his acquaintances have expressed in the past. Because his own academic field has become utterly meaningless to him, he has started translating a text by a Russian colleague on the relation between language and remembering. It is through words, and only through words, the text argues, that people create and construct their memories, thus appropriating, as it were, what has happened. Perlmann<br>

  Abstract: Whether judged by production statistics, by contemporary critical acclaim, by audience popularity or by retrospective opinions, it is abundantly clear that the American silent film comedy (in its two-reel and its feature version) was flourishing in the mid-twenties, and that it rivaled the drama as the dominant form of cinematic expression. My aim is to rethink the function of the gag in relation to the comic film as a classical system – not to examine or catalogue all the possible variations of the gag (as joke, as articulation of cinematic space, or as thematic permutations¹), but rather to examine its<br>

The family always appears in his work; Egoyan always explores it, albeit in different terms, forms, and intensity, in relation to visual media. In this respect, a close reading of this particular film, relevantly entitled Family Viewing, will serve to display the relationship between “family” and “viewing” or, more specifically, between the Armenian family and the videographic medium.

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

  Abstract: Michel Tournier is a writer who explores complex philosophical questions in the guise of concrete, imagistic narratives. This comprehensive study privileges the notion of literary reference, by which the world of text is understood or experienced in metaphorical relation to the world outside of it. Metaphor, in the context of Tournier’s fiction, shows how the fantastic merges with the real to provide new perspectives on many diverse aspects of the modern world: the Crusoe myth, Nazism, the value to society of art and religion, and the nature of education. This book elucidates an aesthetic of Tournier’s fiction that encompasses the writer’s stated ambition to ‘go beyond literature’.<br>

Some say that the referents of language are things in the world, some say they are things, but maybe not in this world, and some say they are mental constructions without any posit that these constructions coalesce with reality.<br>

  Author(s) Sautter Ulrich<br>
  Abstract: Over the past twenty years, there has been an increasing interest in the relation between Donald Davidson’s theory of radical interpretation and Hans-Georg Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics. Whereas some of this interest has been geared toward the intellectual horizon and heritage of Davidson’s work,¹ philosophers such as Richard Rorty and John McDowell have taken Gadamer’s hermeneutics to suggest a possible avenue beyond what they perceive to be the limitations of Davidson’s theory.² This essay approaches the Davidson-Gadamer relation from a different point of view. My concern is not to ask about the proper location or possible limitations of Davidson’s philosophy, but<br>

  Author(s) WHEELER WENDY<br>
  Abstract: The thought of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) is a challenge to thinking because it asks us to imagine being differently. His works are not straightforward and do not set out an explicit program for social change but rather invite a shift in attention and conception of self in relation to world, time, and the nature of knowledge. This shift involves refusing a major aspect of our late modernity, that is, the ubiquity and dominance of forms of abstract and theoretical knowledge. Heidegger wishes to return this knowledge to its proper place, grounded in pragmatic relationships that respond<br>

  Book Title: Textual Intimacy-Autobiography and Religious Identities<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KORT WESLEY A.<br>
  Abstract: Given its affinity with questions of identity, autobiography offers a way into the interior space between author and reader, especially when writers define themselves in terms of religion. In his exploration of this "textual intimacy," Wesley Kort begins with a theorization of what it means to say who one is and how one's self-account as a religious person stands in relation to other forms of self-identification. He then provides a critical analysis of autobiographical texts by nine contemporary American writers-including Maya Angelou, Philip Roth, and Anne Lamott-who give religion a positive place in their accounts of who they are. Finally, in disclosing his own religious identity, Kort concludes with a meditation on several meanings of the word

  RELIGIOUS IDENTITY AS BEING RECEIVED from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrjgw">Textual Intimacy</a><br>
  Abstract: Intimacy is crucial for autobiography because the force and significance of this kind of text depends primarily on a close relation between the reader and the teller. Intimacy is also a factor in religious self-disclosure because religious identity in American culture is a personal matter and not publicly displayed. This study exposes and explores the convergence of these two kinds of intimacy.<br>

  Book Title: Doing Justice to Mercy-Religion, Law, and Criminal Justice<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Jung Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Authored by legal practitioners, activists, and theorists in addition to theologians and ethicists, the essays collected here are informed by timeless principles, and yet they could not be timelier. The trend in sentencing moves toward an increased severity, and the number of incarcerated people in the United States is at an all-time high. In the half-decade since 9/11, moreover, homeland security has established itself as a permanent fixture in our lives. In this atmosphere, the current volume seeks initially to clarify how justice and mercy intertwine in relation to a number of issues, such as rehabilitation, the death penalty, domestic violence, and war crimes. Exploring the legal, philosophical, and theological grounds for mercy in our courts, the discussion then moves to the practical ways in which mercy may be implemented.<br>

  Abstract: Given the long-term participation by the Historians of Religion in the meetings inspired by Carl Jung, it seems virtually unavoidable that any study of their theories of religion must carefully assess their respective positions in relation to psychology. This, however, is a particularly vexatious area of research, inasmuch as each explicitly opposed the reduction of religious realities to psychological forces. On the other hand, each scholar, at the same time, was accustomed to employing psychological categories—of which archetypes are only the best known—to interpret religious materials.¹<br>

  Abstract: The concept of the symbol has appeared often in criticism of music. This is a different kind of symbol from that described by Peirce; for the American semiologist, symbol is opposed to icon and index in a trichotomy of signs. But for the aesthetic idealists, the symbol has a transcendent resonance which gives it a master-function in music and makes it a determinant of moral force and aesthetic value. In this kind of symbol, the relation of signifier and signified is asymmetric; what is signified is a radical idealism, an overcoming of the antinomy of thought and object. The imagination<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

Nevertheless, a different type of relation exists between them, having to do with the importance and quality of the services they render.

  Abstract: Beginning with the treatment of beauty and holiness in Hebrew, Greek, and classical Christian thought, the author traces the emergence of modern theories of aesthetics and religion in the Enlightenment.

In a global context Martin explores the relation of aesthetic theory to religious thought in the traditions of India, China, and Japan and concludes with reflections on the viability of modern aesthetic and religious theory in the light of contemporary cultural and methodological pluralism.<br>

  Abstract: Merleau-Ponty offers us an existentialist philosophy that understands our freedom and responsibility as inseparable from our embodiment. Though he does not explicitly and systematically articulate an ethics, his notion of embodiment nonetheless implies a certain existentialist ethics. For, according to Merleau-Ponty, to be embodied is to be inherently in relation to others, and thus, as I will argue, it is to be implicated in and moved by an imperative to strive for mutual recognition. This paper seeks to elucidate this embodied ethics of mutual recognition.<br>

These strategies involve a reconceptualization of distance that recognizes the productive and affirmative nature of separation.<br>

  Abstract: I want to proffer a schema.

This will involve more than just advancing a particular typology, however, for in so doing I shall also be putting forth an argument: namely that, given a proper understanding of the relation between philosophy and ideology, postmodernism is superior to neutralism, pluralism to postmodernism, and patriotism to pluralism, making the patriot’s approach<br>

  Abstract: At the heart of Bronwen Wallace’s poetics is a profound sense of the way our lives take shape in narrative relation to other people’s stories and their reciprocal responses to ours. As a result, she developed a poetic voice that was immediate, down-to-earth, and always caught in the act of offering up a good story. Her distinctive gesture is the direct address of the talking lyric, calling a community of readers into narrative filiation and response-ability. Significantly, she attributes her talking lyric to forms that, for her, constitute female popular knowledge and culture – gossip and storytelling.¹ In a number of<br>

  Book Title: Karl Polanyi on Ethics and Economics-Foreword by Marguerite Mendell<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Baum Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Exploring Polanyi's lesser-known works as well as The Great Transformation, Baum provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Polanyi's thought. He examines Polanyi's interpretation of modern economic and social history, clarifies the ethical presuppositions present in Polanyi's work, and addresses how Polanyi's understanding of the relation between ethics and economics touches on many issues relevant to the contemporary debate about the world's economic future. Baum argues that we should look to Polanyi's understanding of modern capitalism to reinstate the social discourse and, in political practice, the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. He points to examples, both in Canada and abroad, of attempts to formulate alternative models of economic development and to create new forms of institutional and cultural intervention.<br>

  Abstract: Aphorism, while constituting a literary genre
                  per se,can function concomitantly with a different genre — for example, the novel. Aphorisms deployed along with another genre serve both as a component of the overall text and as text in and of themselves. Given their differentiated identity, aphorisms display idiosyncratic powers of evocation peculiar to the genre. Because of its peculiar behaviour in relation to the narrated chain of events, aphorism often demands the reader’s focused attention. Once a reader becomes conscious of their rhetorical and semantic content, a novel’s aphorisms might do little more than support a traditional reading of the<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Matthews Eric<br>
  Abstract: In this clear and comprehensive account of Merleau-Ponty's thought Eric Matthews shows how Merleau-Ponty has contributed to current debates in philosophy, such as the nature of consciousness, the relation between biology and personality, the historical understanding of human thought and society, and many others. Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, Matthews examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and the understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are of immensely important to the development of modern French philosophy. Matthews evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by analytic philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as all students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.<br>

Competing visions of history, I suggest, have always been integral to conceptions of self-identity and relationship to the “other,” in individual and communal interactions.

He asks how history transcends the obsessive 'linguistic' turn, which has been hegemonizing literary/discourse analysis, and focuses greater attention on historical experience and where history stands in relation to our understanding of ethics, religion and the current state of global politics that underlines the manipulation and abuse of history.<br>

  Book Title: Origins and Ends of the Mind-Philosophical Essays on Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis claims that the individual human mind is structured by its childhood relationships with its parents. But the theory of attachment, evolutionary psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind have all recently re-introduced new dimensions of innateness into mental development and pathology. If attachment is an instinct, then what is the psychological status of the child's relation to the mother? If the mind is in part a product of evolution, then how far down do the inhibitory mechanisms of the mind go? If the mind of the child is shaped by their encounter with a set of prohibitions, how, in the light of contemporary 'cognitive science' and philosophy of mind, can the child be conceived as 'taking on' a rule? How is the construction of the mind related to the normative ends of cognitive experience? Today, it is Lacanian psychoanalysis which most vigorously defends psychoanalytic theory and practice from the encroachment of the biological and 'cognitive' sciences. But a paradigm shift nevertheless appears to be underway, in which the classical psychoanalytic theories about the Oedipus complex, primary and secondary repression, sexual difference and psychosexuality, the role of symbols,etc, are being dismantled and reintegrated into a new synthesis of biological and psychological theories. In this collection of theoretical essays by philosophers and psychoanalysts, encounters are brought about between Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis on the one hand, and attachment theory, evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind on the other.<br>

Freud’s theory of sexuality, therefore, can only be understood when it is confronted with his theory of jokes. Surprisingly, such a simultaneous reading ofJokesandThree Essaysleads us very far away from the classical interpretation of Freud’s theory of sexuality and especially from his later theory centred on the Oedipus complex.

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Intelligibility and Judgment from:

  Author(s) KOSTER EDWIN<br>
  Abstract: Scientific understanding has, so far, mainly been discussed in terms of the intelligibility of theories and the relation between understanding and explanation. In the course of this debate several theoretical virtues have been identified as being conducive to such understanding. Interestingly, the virtues addressed are the ones that have also occupied a prominent place in the discussion of models. The epistemic value of models, for example, has been ascribed to their providing us with visualizations (Nagel 1961; Griesemer 2004), specifying relevant causal mechanisms (Glennan 2005; Darden 2007), equipping us with mathematically tractable systems (Humphreys 2004), describing different kinds of phenomena<br>

  Abstract: Recent scholarship on Catalan culture has tended to focus on space, urban geography and memory in relation to place. The city of Barcelona has been the obvious case study, not just because of its international projection, but also because of its position as a site of symbolic struggles with regards to Catalan identity (see Epps, 2004; Johnson, 2006; Resina, 2008a). By virtue of its very title, Ventura Pons’s nineteenth feature film,
                  Barcelona (Un mapa)(2007), would therefore seem to be an ideal object for analysis from this kind of perspective. Indeed, the film’s title appears to point to the centrality<br>

Mascall suggests that it would be interesting to discuss the existentialism of St. Thomas Aquinas in relation to contemporary philosophies known by the same name. In the past, Catholic philosophy has been dominated and distorted by an essentialist, Cartesian interpretation of St. Thomas and many have come to regard him as a Christianized Aristotle and his philosophy as a completely idealist, rationalistic and closed system. The dominant place given to atheism and freedom in Sartre’s writings can only be fully understood as a reaction against this essentialist Thomism. In contrast to such<br>

  Book Title: Kathleen Jamie-Essays and Poems on Her work<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Falconer Rachel<br>
  Abstract: Kathleen Jamie's works are classics. No one can read Kathleen Jamie and remain indifferent or unchanged. Nationally acclaimed since her first major publications in the 1980s, Jamie stands out from other contemporary poets in her exceptional musicality, her strikingly unusual perspectives, her wry humour, translucent imagery, and hard-edged economy of expression. These 16 newly commissioned critical essays and 7 previously unpublished poems by leading poets make up the first full-length study of Kathleen Jamie's writing. The essays discuss all of her poetry collections, including The Queen of Sheba (1994), Jizzen (1999), Mr and Mrs Scotland Are Dead: Poems 1980-94 (2002), The Tree House (2004) and The Overhaul (2012), as well as her travel writing, including Among Muslims (2002), her nature writing, Findings (2005) and Sightlines (2012) and her collaborative work, including Frissure (2013), with artist Brigid Collins. Whether engaging with national politics, with gender, with landscape and place, or with humanity's relation to the natural environment, this volume demonstrates that Kathleen Jamie's verse teaches us new ways of listening, of seeing and of living in the contemporary world.<br>

This is the first of two concluding chapters making the argument that Levinas is best read as someone who offers us the possibility of thinking about ethics as perpetual critique of the law, rather than as a legal theorist. In other words, instead of using his work to think about how we inject ethics into law or unveil law’s ethical foundation, his philosophy provides resources to understand<br>

There is one primary reason, according to Foucault, why the performative cannot define the statement. Even if one says that an illocutionary act is complete, one has to<br>

Of what does the audience need to be persuaded? – the truthfulness, authenticity and plausibility of what is presented. This association of sound with a rhetorical function (persuasion) underscores sound’s relation to the image in documentary film as one of support. Working in a subordinate role, sound, it is thought, enhances and consolidates the tasks set by the image; the soundtrack is simply part of<br>

  Book Title: The Ethics of Deconstruction-Derrida and Levinas<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Critchley Simon<br>
  Abstract: The Ethics of Deconstruction, Simon Critchley's first book, was originally published to great acclaim in 1992. It was the first book to argue for the ethical turn in Derrida's work and to show as powerfully as possible how deconstruction has persuasive ethical consequences that are vital to our thinking through of questions of politics and democracy. Rather than being concerned with deconstruction in terms of the contradictions inherent in any text - an approach typical of the early Derrida and those in literary criticism aiming to extract a critical method for an application to literature - Critchley concerns himself with the philosophical context necessary for an understanding of the ethics of deconstructive reading. Far from being some sort of value-free nihilism or textual free-play, Critchley showed the ethical impetus that was driving Derrida's work. His claim was that Derrida's understanding of ethics has to be understood in relation to his engagement with the work of Levinas and the book lays out the details of their philosophical confrontation.<br>

  Abstract: If, as I have argued in this book, the pattern of reading that is found in deconstruction can be understood as an unconditional ethical demand in the Levinasian sense, then is this in itself an adequate response to the question of politics? If deconstruction can provide new resources for thinking about ethical responsibility, then does this also entail a satisfactory account of political responsibility? What is the political moment in deconstruction? Can deconstruction provide an account of justice and a just polity?

The significance of the notions of ‘anticipation’ and ‘prolepsis’ is that, in different ways, they refer to this relation between the present and actual or possible futures.

  Abstract: The last chapter argued that the possibility of friendship rests on our acceptance of a fiction – or what Derrida argues is an illusion – of connection, despite the impossibility of any complete or sustained connection between friends. Despite the fragility of the fiction, its power and pleasure help us to accept and forgive our friends’ shortcomings and to make sacrifices on our friends’ behalf. Sándor Márai, in his novel 
                  Embers, takes the concept of - forgiveness in friendship to its limits. He presents friendship as an ethical relation founded on duty born of loyalty to the preference that initially generated the<br>

  Abstract: As seen in the preceding chapter, Žiž¡ek’s act is conceptualised in a close dialogue with Alain Badiou’s theorisation of the event. Before bringing the first part of 
                  The Lacanian Left to a close, it is thus important to deal more thoroughly with the relation between Žiž¡ek and Badiou, more precisely between Žiž¡ek’s act and Badiou’s event, and with the place Badiou’s ethics occupy within the Lacanian Left.¹ The exact parameters of this relation are greatly obscured not only by the complexity of the two theoretico-political projects and their various reorientations over time, but also by the often contradictory comments of<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

In using the term ‘Idea’, Deleuze is not referring to the common-sense use of the term, or the use to which empiricists like Hume or Locke put it, for whom the word ‘idea’ refers primarily to<br>

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Herrnstein Smith Barbara<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the radical reconceptions of knowledge and science emerging from constructivist epistemology, social studies of science, and contemporary cognitive science. Smith reviews the key issues involved in the twentieth-century critiques of traditional views of human knowledge and scientific truth and gives an extensively informed explanation of the alternative accounts developed by Fleck, Kuhn, Foucault, Latour, and others. She also addresses the various anxieties (e.g., over ‘relativism’) and ‘wars’ occasioned by these developments, placing them in their historical contexts and arguing that they are largely misplaced or spurious. Smith then examines the currently perplexed relations between the natural and human sciences, the grandiose claims and dubious methods of evolutionary psychology, and the complex play of naturalist, humanist, and posthumanist ideologies in contemporary views of the relation between humans and animals.<br>

  Book Title: Memory and the Moving Image-French Film in the Digital Era<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): McNeill Isabelle<br>
  Abstract: A vital rethinking of memory and the moving image for the digital age, Isabelle McNeill investigates the role of the moving image in cultural memory, considering the impact of digital technologies on visual culture. Drawing on an interdisciplinary range of theoretical resources and an unusual body of films and moving image works, the author examines the ways in which recent French filmmaking conceptualises both the past and the workings of memory. Ultimately the author argues that memory is an intersubjective process, in which filmic forms continue to play a crucial role even as new media come to dominate our contemporary experience.Memory and the Moving Image:*Introduces new ways of thinking about the relation between film and memory, arising from a compelling, interdisciplinary study of theories and films*Subtly explores the French context while drawing theoretical conclusions with wider implications and applicability*Provides detailed and illuminating close readings of varied moving image works to aid theoretical explorations*Moves away from auteurist approaches, examining work by canonical directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Chris Marker and Agnès Varda alongside that of less well-known filmmakers such as Claire Simon and Yamina Benguigui*Brings together thinkers such as Bergson, Deleuze, Bazin and Barthes with, for example, Rodowick and Mulvey, in an engaging interweaving of theories.Works considered include Jean-Luc Godard's Histoire(s) du Cinéma (1989-98), Yamina Benguigui's Mémoires d'Immigrés (1997), Chris Marker's CD-ROM Immemory (1998), Claire Simon's Mimi (2003), Michael Haneke's Caché (2005) and Agnès Varda's multi-media exhibition, L'Île et Elle (2006).<br>

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen in Chapter 4, the work of both Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein shows a tension between realism as faithfulness to the truth of the world on one hand and realism as reproducing the myths of bourgeois capitalism on the other. For Vertov, facts were central in overcoming this problematic of representation, as expressed in his rejection of actors, filmscripts, created scenarios, and so on. For Eisenstein, however, the relation between the facts of world and their reproduction on the screen was in some ways more complex.

  Abstract: This book centres on Deleuze’s understanding of literature as ‘an enterprise of health’ and of literary criticism’s links to aspects of pathology and clinical practice, especially as these latter come under scrutiny in Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘schizoanalysis’ project (CC 3). The relation between literature and health is argued for most explicitly by Deleuze in his last published book,
                  Essays Critical and Clinical. It is here that he lays out the principal hypothesis of a clinical criticism: certain authors have a weak health, but literature, by gaining a perspective on sickness, is capable of transforming this weakness into a creative power.<br>

This chapter, by contrast, turns its attentions to a different kind of thinker: one who begins as a self-nominated ‘philosopher’, but who, in covertly drawing from<br>

  Abstract: Gadamer’s critique of aesthetic subjectivity insists that, phenomenologically speaking, an involvement with art demonstrates that the experience of meaning has primacy over the experience of aesthetic properties. If meaning results from the conveyance of significance within bodies of semantic relations (which Gadamer describes collectively as linguisticality), meaning’s mode of being, whether visual or literary, is
                  presentational. With characteristic restraint, this simple move in Gadamer’s aesthetics prompts a major ontological shift in thinking about the ancient but nonetheless continuingly contentious question of art’s relation to reality.

  Author(s): Musheno Michael<br>
  Abstract: Whether on a patrol beat, in social service offices, or in public school classrooms, street-level workers continually confront rules in relation to their own beliefs about the people they encounter. Cops, Teachers, Counselors is the first major study of street-level bureaucracy to rely on storytelling. Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno collect the stories told by these workers in order to analyze the ways that they ascribe identities to the people they encounter and use these identities to account for their own decisions and actions. The authors show us how the world of street-level work is defined by the competing tensions of law abidance and cultural abidance in a unique study that finally allows cops, teachers, and counselors to voice their own views of their work.Steven Maynard-Moody is Director of the Policy Research Institute and Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.Michael Musheno is Professor of Justice and Policy Studies at Lycoming College and Professor Emeritus of Justice Studies, Arizona State University.<br>

  Author(s): Duran Jane<br>
  Abstract: Spanning over nine hundred years, Eight Women Philosophers is the first singly-authored work to trace the themes of standard philosophical theorizing and feminist thought across women philosophers in the Western tradition. Jane Duran has crafted a comprehensive overview of eight women philosophers--Hildegard of Bingen, Anne Conway, Mary Astell, Mary Wollstonecraft, Harriet Taylor Mill, Edith Stein, Simone Weil, and Simone de Beauvoir--that underscores the profound and continuing significance of these thinkers for contemporary scholars. _x000B_Duran devotes one chapter to each philosopher and provides a sustained critical analysis of her work, utilizing aspects of Continental theory, poststructuralist theory, and literary theory. She situates each philosopher within her respective era and in relation to her intellectual contemporaries, and specifically addresses the contributions each has made to major areas such as metaphysics/epistemology, theory of value, and feminist theory. She affirms the viability and importance of recovering these women's overlooked work and provides a powerful answer to the question of why the rubric "women philosophers" remains so valuable.<br>

  Abstract: There are good reasons to begin our discussion of bioaesthetics with Kant, who published at a time when academic disciplines were still being established and the “two cultures” did not yet exist.¹ Aesthetics, indeed, was a new academic discipline defined by the German philosopher Gottlieb Alexander Baumgarten in 1750 as the “science of sensory knowledge.” Aesthetics, according to Baumgarten, was meant to clarify the relation between the sensory data based on human experience, on the one hand, and the scientific knowledge that could be derived from that data via the use of reason, on the other.

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

  Abstract: This epigraph in two parts establishes hospitality and mourning as the principle of ethics. The word “itself” [
                  même] designates both the one and the other as the essence of ethics. How are we to understand this conjunction? Does it mean that one of the two terms (hospitality) concerns our relation to the living and the other (mourning) our memory of the dead? Or, on the contrary, should we not say instead that the one term cannot be conceptualized without the other? And, if this is so, what does this impossible dissociation of the twofold responsibility that is being implied teach<br>

However, the object was not to defend their instrumentalization, their colonization in the interests of power.

  Abstract: In the late 1990s I coined the phrase “object-oriented philosophy.”¹ By the time of this writing (May 2012), the term had gained widespread international usage.² The two basic principles of my object-oriented approach are as follows: (1) objects have genuine reality at many different scales, not just the smallest, and (2) objects withdraw from all types of relation, whether those of human knowledge or of inanimate causal impact. In short, objects exist at many different levels of complexity, and they are always a hidden surplus deeper than any of the relations into which they might enter. The rest of object-oriented<br>

  Abstract: Every conception of culture, identity, ethics, or thinking contains an image of nature. And the relation goes the other way too. Even the most adamant realist in, say, engineering presupposes a cultural conception of how scientific cognition proceeds. To adopt the correspondence model of truth, for instance, is to act as if human capacities for cognition can be brought into close correspondence with the way of the world separate from those capacities. Nietzsche would say that such a realism preserves the remains of an old theology.¹ Its operational assumption, first, that the world

But Dante’s small book is forward-, rather than backward-looking; Dante saw his poetry as the culmination and fulfillment of his predecessors’ poetics, and as a promise of something greater, as completing their works in the same way that the New Testament was thought to have completed the Old—a figural reading of literary<br>

  Abstract: Our presentist present is by no means uniform or clear-cut, and it is experienced very differently depending on the position we occupy in society. We are caught up in global movement and accelerated flows, or else condemned to the life of casual workers, living from hand to mouth in a stagnant present, with no recognized past, and no real future either (since the temporality of plans and projects is inaccessible). The present is therefore experienced as emancipation or enclosure, and the perspective of the future is no longer reassuring, since it is perceived not as a promise, but as a threat. Hartog's resonant readings show us how the motor of history(-writing) has stalled and help us understand the contradictory qualities of our contemporary presentist relation to time.<br>

Wang did so briefly in 1989.¹ In a recent volume of Joseph Needham’s Science and Civilisation in China, Christoph Harbsmeier makes constant and telling comparisons with Greek and Sanskrit at various points of his magisterial survey of Chinese language and logic.² Despite that scholar’s compendious review of virtually all the major relevant issues pertaining<br>

  Abstract: The present chapter,¹ based on the Spanish chronicles and other colonial documents, represents an introduction to the types of accounting registers devised by Andean societies, as well as to the new uses to which they were put at the time of the European conquest of the New World. The analysis is very straightforward in the case of the khipu used for accounting purposes, but it is more complex and daring in relation to those khipu that served to register historical and literary narratives.<br>

  Abstract: In
         Inconceivable Effects, Martin Blumenthal-Barby reads theoretical, literary and cinematic works that appear noteworthy for the ethical questions they raise. Via critical analysis of writers and filmmakers whose projects have changed our ways of viewing the modern world-including Hannah Arendt, Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, the directors ofGermany in Autumn, and Heiner Mueller-these essays furnish a cultural base for contemporary discussions of totalitarian domination, lying and politics, the relation between law and body, the relation between law and justice, the question of violence, and our ways of conceptualizing "the human."<br>

  Abstract: I would like now to provide further evidence of the pragmatic function of absolute metaphors in relation to two very specific examples, the

It is characteristic of both that they originate in quite specific historical ‘experiences’: the first gives a metaphorical gloss to the age of discovery’s conclusion that the ‘known world’, which for millennia was relatively constant and appeared to have certain zones of unfamiliarity only at its edges, proves in retrospect to have taken up only a small corner of the earth’s surface; the other views the universe<br>

The Bolsheviks in Russia and the Fascists in Italy both recognized the importance of mobilizing the masses through the elaboration of a civil religion.

  Book Title: Mourning Happiness-Narrative and the Politics of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: Soni explains that this puzzling phenomenon can only be comprehended by studying a structural transformation of the idea of happiness at the level of narrative form. Happiness is stripped of its ethical and political content, Soni demonstrates, when its intimate relation to narrative is destroyed. This occurs, paradoxically, in some of the most characteristic narratives of the period: eighteenth-century novels including
         Pamela, The Vicar of Wakefield, andJulie; the pervasive sentimentalism of the time; Kant's ethics; and the political thought of Rousseau and Jefferson.<br>

  Abstract: The decision to re-enact on the page a scene of oral storytelling is extraordinarily prevalent in late-medieval French literature, as it will continue to be throughout the sixteenth century. Texts such as the anonymous
                     Cent nouvelles nouvelles(1462) and the anonymousÉvangiles des quenouilles(ca. 1470–80)¹ experiment with the staging of oral storytelling in a range of ways, using embedded narratives, the structural device of the frame, and the depiction of storytelling circles. Scenes of oral storytelling are fertile ground for inquiry regarding late medieval practices of story transmission, especially the dynamic relation between performance and audience reception.²<br>

  Book Title: Secret Police Files from the Eastern Bloc-Between Surveillance and Life Writing<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Petrescu Corina L.<br>
  Abstract: The communist secret police services of Central and Eastern Europe kept detailed records not only of their victims but also of the vast networks of informants and collaborators upon whom their totalitarian systems depended. These records, now open to the public in many former Eastern Bloc countries, reflect a textually mediated reality that has defined and shaped the lives of former victims and informers, creating a tension between official records and personal memories. Exploring this tension between a textually and technically mediated past and the subject/victim's reclaiming and retrospective interpretation of that past in biography is the goal of this volume. While victims' secret police files have often been examined as a type of unauthorized archival life writing, the contributors to this volume are among the first to analyze the fragmentary and sometimes remedial nature of these biographies and to examine the subject/victims' rewriting and remediation of them in various creative forms. Essays focus, variously, on the files of the East German Stasi, the Romanian Securitate (in relation to Transylvanian Germans in Romania), and the Hungarian State Security Agency. Contributors: Carol Anne Costabile-Heming, Ulrike Garde, Valentina Glajar, Yuliya Komska, Alison Lewis, Corina L. Petrescu, Annie Ring, Aniko Szucs.

  Abstract: The collapse of Castilian royal authority in the 1460s challenged the wielders of power there to redefine in practice where, in relation to Enrique iv’s much-weakened monarchy, their interests and allegiances now lay. It also called in question the ethically and juridically grounded models of royal rule as sanctioned by providence, promoted among them by the secular court culture of Enrique’s father Juan ii. For most individuals, no doubt, this meant adjusting the theory to validate their newly identified interests – which was what happened collectively in the settlement eventually established by the Reyes Católicos.

  Abstract: Much of the criticism on Thomas King’s fiction focuses on border crossing, and rightly so: national boundaries, town lines, bridges, rivers, and myriad other signs point to in-between spaces where King renegotiates hierarchical binaries. The role of gender in relation to this motif, though, remains underexplored. King’s texts are full of gender-ambiguous characters, some of whom harness the power to revise the dominant discourses of Empire, but discussions of gender have nevertheless taken the proverbial backseat to discussions of race.¹ This is surprising, given that the intersectionality of race and gender has been well established in feminist and postcolonial theory<br>

  Abstract: Orthodoxy, as a holistic, religious experience, may initially appear to be an incompatible referent when considered with purely political forms of personal and societal expression. From a Serbian historical perspective, this almost unequal relation originates in the territorial organisation of the church, which transcends political boundaries in an encompassing pursuit of her congregation’s existential problems, sacred or profane. The political encroachment of the Orthodox laity, the separation of
                  vox Dei from vox populi, was forcibly pronounced under the secular conditions of Yugoslav communism, which limited the scope, intensity and formal depth of confessional affinities. In an Orthodox environment, communism’s appeal<br>

Writers like Hayek have assumed that the quest for utopia, usually conceived of as some form of near-perfect society, is causally linked to such regimes, and is practically synonymous with the excesses of Hitler and Stalin.

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Chapter 3 concerns rights theory (with a focus on Tom Regan’s work), while chapter 4, ostensibly about meat eating and hunting, concerns utilitarianism (with a focus on the writings of Peter Singer and his critics, some of whom, such as R. G. Frey, come from within the utilitarian ranks). Chapter 5 addresses the use of animals in scientific research (including the burgeoning field of genetic engineering) and chapter 6 inquires into the relation between animal liberation and environmentalism.

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Suppose we begin with the subject who seeks personal fulfillment and meaningful human associations within just institutions. For Ricoeur, this subject is defined by its capacities for language, action, narrative identity, and for ethical and moral evaluation. As a subject I am that who speaks, acts, narrates my life, and evaluates objects and actions as good in ethical evaluation or obligatory in moral evaluation. These capacities all possess a triadic structure: I can designate myself as an “I” or the subject who is speaking only within a structure that includes a “you” to whom I speak and a he/she/it about whom or which we speak. Ricoeur claims that this last relationship represents the institution of language “inasmuch as it encompasses all the speakers of one natural language who know themselves and who are bound together by the recognition of the common rules that distinguish one language from another” (p. 6). Consequently, Ricoeur criticizes social contract liberalism because it presupposes a subject who possesses natural rights prior to the contractual relation. For Ricoeur, the subject of rights emerges only through the political mediation that provides the institutional conditions under which mere capacities can be actualized as accomplishments.<br>

Abstract: 3. Did I overlook possible points of continuity across paradigms?The answer to this question relates to criteria for establishing continuity. The use of the same term, for example, does not mean that its meaning (extensionally or intensionally) is the same. Thus, Darnells suggestion that we all share ethnography, for example, is appealing, but I am not sure that ethnography means the same for all of those engaged in it, especially as more and more students are encouraged to work in their own communities and engage in urban (or suburban) fieldwork that often forces them to live the contradictions of an alienated native self or of a privileged fieldworker on the way to acquiring a professional multiplepersonality disorder. CookGumperz and Gumperz mention narrative and narrativity. It is difficult for me to see the narratives recorded by Boas as the same thing as the narratives collected and analyzed by Ochs and Capps (2001). They are both texts, but they were produced, recorded, and analyzed in such different ways that their similarities rapidly vanish as we expand the notion of teller to include the work done by participants in the narrative event. Finally, Spitulnik brings up the socalled SapirWhorf hypothesis as a possible source of continuity across paradigms. This is the most challenging of the three proposals for a thematic link across paradigms because the SapirWhorf hypothesis has almost mythical proportions in the public imagination. Together with the evolution of language (a topic that most linguists tend to avoid), the SapirWhorf hypothesis is a must in anthropology textbooks and in introductory books on language and culture. But the semanticindeterminacy problem is here even more serious than for ethnography and narrative given that, as Spitulnik knows (see her use of the qualifier socalled), there never was a SapirWhorf hypothesis, unless we take for it Hoijers (1954:93) rarely quoted informal and very general definition: The central idea of the SapirWhor~<br>

               The computer, in the present context, has thus become an appendix of the human body owing to the acquisition of a number of skills that Hawking has mastered: the rapidity with which he touches his commutator, the manipulation of certain operations for selecting words in the construction of sentences, the choice of the right keys to activate the synthetic voice.To use language in speech, reading and writing, is to extend our bodily equipment and become intelligent human beings. We may say that when we learn to use language, or a probe, or a tool, and thus make ourselves aware of these things as we are of our body, we
            interiorizethese things andmake ourselves dwell in them.42
               43As one would say of an individual who has mastered all the subtleties of a new language, he has, as one of his students points out, “become totally ‘fluent’ with his computer.” The designer of Hawking’s software, Walter Woltosz, recalls that Hawking could be much faster with using a new software called EZ Keys at carrying on a conversation, but Hawking thinks that he is faster on Equalizer: “It is burned into his brain. He has been using it for fifteen years … fifteen hours a day and he knows it so well that he is very comfortable with it.… It really is an extension of himself now.”44As Polanyi says, “Every time we assimilate a tool to our body our identity undergoes some change; our person expands into new modes of being,”45or, as Drew Leder suggests, in the tradition of Merleau‐Ponty: “The true relation between body and instrument, phenomenological rather than crudely materialistic in character, is only revealed when we reverse the analogy. It is not that the body is like a tool, but that the tool is like a second sort of body, incorporated into and extending our corporeal powers.”46“To incorporate a tool is to redesign one’s extended body until its extremities expressly mesh with the world” (
               , p. 34).AB~<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: I would like to conclude this essay by suggesting a model for understanding the relationship between apologetics and comparative theology that builds on Clooney’s general idea that comparative theology replaces apologetics while retaining an apologetic dimension. And yet, while adhering to the basic guidelines set by Clooney’s position, the model I propose differs in that it places greater emphasis on the aspect of discontinuity between comparative theology and traditional apologetics. I shall argue that comparative theology’s relationship to apologetics is better understood, not as a relation of subsumption, but rather as one of sublation, implying an element of negation. Comparative theology presupposes the negation of apologetics as apologetics is traditionally understood. An apologetic element is indeed preserved in comparative theology but only in a radically altered form.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: See Hans‐Georg Gadamer,
            Truth and Method, trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall, 2nd ed. and 2nd rev. ed. (New York: Crossroad, 1989; Continuum, 1998); Emmanuel Levinas,Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, trans. Alphonso Lingis (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), 33–52. Levinas argues that dialogue is founded upon the asymmetrical relationship between the self and the infinite Other (“Dialogue … is a thinking of theunequal, a thought thinkingbeyondthe given” [Emmanuel Levinas,God Who Comes to Mind, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998), 151]) and in that sense not a method of uncovering truth but a call to (self‐) transcendence, i.e., to ethics (ibid., 143–51). Levinas’s purely asymmetrical ethical understanding of the self‐other relation, in which the practice of dialogue is reduced to the infinite Other’s “breaking in” and rupturing of the totalizing horizon of my world, is meant as a critique of Hegel’s more symmetrical, interdependent, and holistic understanding of the self‐other relation in terms of mutual recognition. But this criticism is predicated on what in my view is an unconvincing identification of holism, which is an internally differentiated harmony, with totality, which is devoid of internal differentiation whatsoever. I follow Paul Ricoeur’s more Hegelian, dialectical understanding of the self‐other relation (that is at the same time informed by the Levinasian critique), in which the horizon of my world is driven by its own logic to a universalizability test via the sieve of the other’s scrutiny and is transformed in the process.

Abstract: As with many of these issues, there is more that could be said. The point can be taken, however, that Frei’s attunement to Midrash emerges within his writings in conjunction with a stronger emphasis on the plurality of views within the literal sense.
         57It also models how Christianity, in the particularity of the literal sense, is called to be a countercommmunity, defined and interpreted within the world of scripture rather than on the general, ideologically‐driven criteria of a culture. Such particularity would enable an alternative way of living in our world—transforming relations between Judaism and Christianity, as well as redefining Christianity in relation to its surrounding culture. It also enables a pluralistic unity within the Christian community, as grounded in the shared pursuit of the literal sense.<br>

Abstract: In 1977, Lawrence Lipking argued in
      Critical Inquirythat, because the division between text and footnote is never stable, even within the footnote itself—a position we agree with—footnotes should be dispensed with in favor of the marginal note. He wrote, “Fewer and fewer literary critics, these days, would accept the philosophical model of discourse on which the relation between text and note was founded: the clear division between certain knowledge, brought to light in the text, and conjectural or historical evidence, cited below.” Lipking, who wryly noted that “footnotes… stand for a scholarly community, assembled by the author specifically so that he can join it,” hoped to see a revolution in both essayistic form and professionalism. He hoped for a new kind of critic “who considers that community [of footnote‐building scholars] an illusion, fabricated for self‐serving ulterior purposes” and who will “choose another [professional] allegiance” and “scorn the footnote” in favor of “the marginal gloss.”12<br>

Abstract: Were those hurt, killed, and dying as a result of the attacks on September 11 able to “give” their experiences, their pain over to God, letting “God use them,” Mrs. Barrett implied, their suffering would, if not be healed, then at least be lessened, for they would accept their Godly purpose, whether that purpose entailed life or death. Like Jesus on the cross, those murdered in this attack were dying as part of a divine purpose. For Mrs. Barrett, then, all historical suffering, whether distant or unfolding, becomes meaningful in relation to God’s intentions, however mysterious. As with Corrie ten Boom’s memoir, Mrs. Barrett’s reading of events—the Holocaust or 9/11—compresses them in the vice meant to bring God and her students into ever‐closer contact. What matters is not the event for its own sake, but the event for the sake of her students;
            11similarly, what matters is not the event’s human dimensions, no matter how immediate, but its divine purposes, which are fixed and predetermined.<br>

Abstract: The equality clause has implications not only for interaction within religions but also for dealings between religions. Let us take the example of the Vatican document
            Dominus Jesus, a declaration of the Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith from 2000, which, we know, testifies to undiminished exclusivism and endeavors to prevent syncretic tendencies.33Does this also imply a prohibition of interreligious dialogue? Not explicitly, but in spirit it does. This document says that dialogue with other religions should be conducted according to the principles of freedom and equality (no. 22). With regard to freedom, it refers to the aforementioned, halfhearted statement of Vatican II about freedom of religion, and when it comes to equality one also needs to be watchful. The document defines equality as follows: “Equality, which is a presupposition of inter‐religious dialogue, refers to the equal personal dignity of the parties in dialogue, not to doctrinal content, nor even less to the position of Jesus Christ—who is God himself made man—in relation to the founders of the other religions” (no. 22). Although this document mentions human dignity, it does so in a way that is entirely indifferent to the beliefs of adherents of other religions and the rites in which these beliefs are expressed. The same sentence reveals the crux of the problem: the position of Jesus Christ “who is God himself made man,” as the document puts it in terms of a “christology from above.” The next phrase is no less noteworthy. It does not state: “Jesus Christ … in relation to the other founders of religions,” but “in relation to the founders of the other religions.” Jesus is elevated above the founders of other religions in a unique and absolute manner as qualitatively superior.<br>

Abstract: However, rights language when it comes to children should also be balanced with languages of adult responsibility. This can be seen by considering such children’s rights in the UN Convention as “freedom of expression” (art. 13), “freedom of thought, conscience and religion” (art. 14), and “access to [mass media] information” (art. 17). Expression, conscience, religion, and mass media information are issues, for children more acutely than for adults, not just of freedom and access—norms grounded in human agency—but also of nurturance, dependency, and guidance. The special relation of children’s rights to adult responsibilities was more clearly recognized in earlier international agreements in 1924 and 1959 on which the 1989 convention is partly based. Here one finds significantly more central language of adult and societal “duty” toward children, “responsibilities” for “special safeguards and care,” and children’s needs for “special protection” and extra “love and understanding.”
         44The language of adult responsibility, while not absent from the 1989 convention, in earlier agreements provides a clearer recognition that children are not just little adult agents deserving the same rights as all but are also profoundly vulnerable, relational, conditioned, and in need of special care from others.<br>

Abstract: These considerations may also help us reflect on the nature of ethics as a disciplinary inquiry. Somewhat like artists, novelists, and even social and physical scientists, ethicists should function, at least in part, as investigators and disrupters of accepted wisdom, imaginers of provocative new moral possibilities, transformers of shared social and cultural worlds, and contributors toward creating more inclusive human meaning. They should do this in creative and fruitful conversation and tension with other disciplines, transforming and being transformed in relation to them.
         39Ethicists can contribute to society in both theoretical and practical ways by challenging ingrained moral ideologies, naming and exposing real social tensions, and innovating new possibilities for social and relational worlds and practices—that is, by engaging their world creatively. This task is already part of the ongoing interpretive conversation of ordinary moral culture. Ethicists may raise social dynamics to higher levels of intentional reflection in the hope of helping humanity better respond to its own primordial poetic capability for “making” this a better world.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: In the profession of librarianship, the topic of ethics has been the focus of considerable attention in recent years. Some of this attention has been direct and has addressed such things as codes of ethics, freedom of information, and the Library Bill of Rights (LBR). Other writings have approached ethics less directly, as we can see from efforts to articulate the field’s core values. These areas of focus are closely related and, while there have been some very detailed examinations of particular issues, the need remains for an extensive look at points of concern and areas in which ethical action is called for. In particular, this article addresses the practical (the ways we live as professionals in relation to our communities) and the normative (what standards for action we can agree upon and why). Practical ethics can be conceived of in several ways (including consideration of what is right and wrong, how action affects others, and how we look at ourselves), but even in the face of criticism [
      2], there is a need to understand what we should do in certain circumstances. The normative element is the anchor for such understanding; Shelly Kagan says that it “involves substantive proposals concerning how to act, how to live, or what kind of person to be. In particular, it attempts to state and defend the most basic principle governing these matters” [3, p. 2]. Amartya Sen wisely observes that “it would be rather absurd to devote much attention to the subject of ethics if it were really the case that ethical considerations would never affect people’s actual behaviour” [4, p. 52].<br>

Abstract: Responsibility for and to this double heritage then requires the invention, each time anew, of a rule according to which both contradictory demands could be met simultaneously or of an action from which such a rule could, after the fact, be construed. In Patočka’s parlance, such responsibility toward the memory of Europe is, therefore, inevitably heretical. The relation to this memory is a responsible one only if the contradictory injunctions are met in a way that amounts to a transformation of the tradition that is new each time, one that is singular. Needless to say, what we have seen in regard to the relation to the memory of Europe is valid as well for all other responsible decision making insofar as it takes place against the backdrop of an experience of tradition. Any responsible decision making must face the demand to give reasons without at the same time being reduced to knowledge that would merely be put into effect.<br>

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Abstract: Though occupied with an ancient figure, the Enoch narrative directs faithful readers of the JST to a future project: the return of Zion in fulfillment of God’s promise to Enoch and, through Enoch, to all the posterity of Noah. In the “last days,” there would be “great tribulations … but my people will I preserve,” God promised. Specifically, “righteousness will I send down out of heaven, and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten.”
         88To Latter‐day Saints, this is nothing less than the heavenly messengers sent to Smith and the unearthing the Book of Mormon’s “golden plates,” which constituted a second witness of Christ by restoring “many plain and precious things” lost from the Bible.89Smith’s narratives weave Mormonism into biblical history, but not as an aspiration to “live ancient lives” so definitive of the Latter‐day Saints' Puritan progenitors. Smith’s followers did not believe their “commonwealth should subside into the routine of the communal covenant: a rhythm of declension and return with a basically static religious and social framework” modeled on a biblical past.90Rather, the Latter‐day Saints aspired to become Enochs in their own right: walking and talking with God and exercising their own powers within a new Zion wherein God would make his millennial abode. In 1836, the Latter‐day Saints’ dedicated their first temple with a song that included the lyric:
               The Latter‐day Saints understood themselves both as beneficiaries of God’s grace and as God’s agents for overcoming of the effects of the fall. The full eschatology of Smith’s Adamic myth is found in the promise made to Enoch, like the promise made to Abraham “that his people would have a salvific relation with God is an inexhaustible promise … as such it opens up a history in which this promise can be repeated and reinterpreted over and over again.”The latter day glory begins to come forth;The visions and blessings of old are returning;~<br>

Article Title: Two Apologetic Moments in Śaṅkara’s Concept of Brahman<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Given that the “results orientation” that Śaṅkara associates with meditation (and, a fortiori, ritual activity) forms the basis of his apologetically driven classification of religious practices, it is easy to see why he would be reluctant to follow the tradition in recognizing bliss as an essential attribute of brahman.
         98Bliss implies a relation—and hence a dualism—between the experience and the experiencer, or, in Śaṅkara’s idiom, between the one who enjoys (bhoktṛ) and what is enjoyed (bhogya). Moreover, in suggesting that the realization of brahman culminates in an experience of bliss, the identification of the bliss sheath and the highest self implies a path to brahman motivated by desire. Ultimately, the identification of the bliss sheath and brahman is unacceptable to Śaṅkara because it blurs the distinction between, on the one hand, salvificjñānaand, on the other, meditative acts oriented toward desired experiences. Overturning theuttarapakṣaallows Śaṅkara to affirm brahman as the transcendent source of bliss, not as a mere experience of bliss.99Thus, Śaṅkara’s apologetic interest in constructing thejñāna/upāsanadichotomy, by occasioning a repudiation of the identification of the blissful self and brahman, plays a role in lifting the latter out of the realm of human experience and motivation.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: This book is based on Don Browning’s most recent work on the relation of Christian ethics and the moral psychologies—a plural that the author uses in order to indicate the pluralist nature of this academic field. Browning states his guiding question as follows: should “moral theologians critique these psychologies and perhaps cleanse both theology and the wider culture of the possible mistaken images of moral responsibility proffered by them?” His “brief answer” is that “
      contemporary moral psychology can contribute to Christian ethics, but only when it does its research with competent pre‐scientific or pre‐empirical understandings of morality”(2). Accordingly, Browning’s special interest refers to the understandings of morality that research presupposes. It is these preunderstandings that require critical analysis by, among others, theologians. The model that Browning uses in his analysis is an adaptation of Paul Ricoeur’s critical hermeneutical ethics. This ethics combines hermeneutical sensitivity to different cultural and religious traditions with a critical point of view informed by, among others, the social sciences and philosophical ethics. It gives due attention to particular visions of the good life and of the “status of humans” (10) without losing touch with the claims of universalist ethical criteria (“the deontological test” [52]). It may also be called “antifoundationalist” in that it begins with history and moral tradition rather than with empirical research as a supposedly objective basis.<br>

Abstract: An alternative end to my account of the fate of re‐vision and its place in feminism today presented itself when, recently, a student came to me to discuss a possible subject for her bachelor’s thesis. She wanted to write something that would contribute to the current debate: a feminist topic, she said, but not, as she put it, “women on the barricades.” One idea she had was to write about Anita Diamant’s
         The Red Tent(1997). This novel tells the story of the biblical Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob. My student had picked up the book while on holiday in Spain and had been deeply moved by it. It had transformed her views on the Bible and made her rethink the relation of women to the biblical narratives.<br>

Abstract: The oldest theory of truth in the history of philosophy is the correspondence theory. A version of this theory has been formulated in both Plato’s
         Cratylus[63, pp. 422–30] and in Aristotle’sMetaphysics iv[64, pp. 749–50]. The correspondence theory asserts that a proposition is true if and only if it corresponds to a state of affairs and that state of affairs obtains. When philosophers speak of propositions, they are referring to the meaning of any particular sentence, regardless of what language that sentence is in. For example, the English sentence “Snow is white” and the German sentence “Schnee ist Weiss” both refer to the proposition that the color of snow is white. A state of affairs refers simply to the expression of a fact that ontologically obtains. Bertrand Russell used the termbeliefinstead ofpropositionand analyzedstate of affairsas a relationship [65, pp. 119–30]. According to Russell, a belief is true if and only if it is a belief that an objectxbears relation R to another objectyandxdoes bear relation R toy. Hence, using our example about snow (x) and white (y), the relation R in this case claims the fact that whiteness is a quality of snow.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Another problem is the book’s unrelenting abstractness. As noted above, issues of nonviolence, solidarity, and dialogue seem to be hovering in the background, but never once does Reynolds mention any actual situation where real communities have confronted these issues. His argument stringently avoids any reference to concrete historical examples. Reynolds also exhibits the dismaying tendency of using simple declarative sentences like these: “The other is a presence who solicits my response by signaling a promise precisely in its distance. Its call is not anonymous, but signifies the trace of something that invites recognition and bids me to pay attention to it. I respond. My world is adjusted. I am transposed, tilted toward the exterior” (113). Where, when, and how are these things actually happening? Only in a vague, theoretical stratosphere? Or in real life? If the latter, why not dwell on a few specific examples? Jargon and underdefined catchphrases further obscure matters: “Thus, meaningful vitality is the constitutive affirmation of being‐with, an affirmation that reflects a presentiment of surplus value intrinsic to the we‐relation” (123).<br>

Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: In
         Fictional Truth, Michael Riffaterre sees the subtextual energy of fiction standing in the same relation to plot as does the unconscious in Freud to the system of conscious perception.29Like the unconscious, and revealed only in signs or symptoms of the otherwise functionally repressed, subtexts are therefore timeless, reversible, and cumulative. If denied maternity (its removal by death or its falsification) locates one such subtext inLittle Dorrit—strung along in counterpoint to the failed father motif, for instance—that matrilineal subtext has its perverse and unexpected returns across the marital trajectory of the son himself, as he is sped along the monorail of its domesticating engine toward the anticipated point of rest and its gender assimilation. Any such subtext, according to Riffaterre, is a phenomenon transcendent to change or if you will subtendent to it. It thereby lies, in the last sentence of his study, “outside the realm of time and … impervious to its ravages.”30Plot is the map of those ravages. Narratology understands this. Narratography would, as I say, reexperience it—and do so in a transferential exchange, against the medial flow, between a nervously cued attention and the insinuated unconscious of the text itself.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 522216<br>
Date: 10 2008<br>
Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: In both Augustine’s and Marcel’s experience, it turns out that the loss of a dear person may entail a loss of self, a sense of personal diminution—the subtraction of a crucial element in one’s purposeful self‐instantiation in the world. In the context of a different discussion, Ricoeur remarks aptly that the death of a loved one “constitutes a genuine amputation of oneself to the extent that the relation with the one who has disappeared forms an integral part of one’s identity.” We saw that Augustine copes with such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the desire of divine love and seeks his own better self through a self‐abnegating identification with this divine love. Marcel reacts instead to such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the materiality of his own mortality and seeks his own better self through a self‐denying identification with the love that the dear one’s death has left imprinted in his organism. In both cases, death’s “radical heterogeneity in relation to … desire” is exorcised by desire itself. The relevant difference between Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective forms of mourning is that the former reflects the metaphysical transcendence intrinsic to a more ancient notion of soul, while the latter’s reflects the soft transcendence of an embodied notion of soul that, however organismic in nature, bridges the gap separating merely genetic and epigenetic responses to mourning from the autonomy of one’s self‐instantiation.

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: In the first case, the loss of a friend, Augustine’s grief teaches him that his love is excessive, an expression of inordinate self‐love. See Augustine,
            Confessions, trans. with an introduction by P. S. Pine‐Coffin (New York: Penguin, 1983), bk. 4. Augustine worries about the same problem after the death of his mother, which launches the principal confession ofConfessions, in bk. 9, chap. 12. Mourning is clearly a response to death for Augustine and has deep connections to his awareness of human finitude and the power of time more generally. Mourning, then, has moral and ontological aspects. In that respect, we must read Augustine’s narrative account of his grief in relation to his theological account of humanity’s being‐in‐time inConfessions, bk. 11. As an act of memory, mourning for Augustine would be an act of what Ricoeur calls “being‐in‐the‐face‐of‐death, against‐death.” See Ricoeur,Memory, History, Forgetting, 369; Lloyd, “Augustine and the ‘Problem' of Time.”<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: The reconstruction of theological ethics in the face of its critics requires, in terms of knowledge, replacing making with a multidimensional network of lateral connections. In terms of power, it replaces concern for unbridled forces with the relation between power and responsibility in world creation and orienting human life. What then about the most basic claim of value; that is, what ought to form the normative conviction of a theological and ethical vision? If we jettison here as well monocentric approaches, if we insist that we cannot define the good just around human flourishing or just around the divine, if we try to tread a path in and through but finally beyond anthropocentrism, theocentrism, or the current neohumanist focus on the finality of other human beings or even an ad hoc postmodernism, what do we have? This returns us, I think, to the elusive and tenacious ambiguity of human life that comes to expression in both religious and humanistic outlooks. It requires us to shift to a more existential level of reflection on responsibility and also the good we can and ought to serve.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: These methodological oversights are surprising since Eades is clearly familiar with research exploring the links between history, memory, and collective representations. She cites Jacques Le Goff, Marc Ferro, Pierre Nora, Michel de Certeau, Paul Ricoeur, and Henry Rousso alongside a wide range of colonial/postcolonial historians and theorists, including Robert Stam, Benjamin Stora, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dominick LaCapra. In the end, theory and formal analysis drown out contextual issues of production, distribution, and reception. Three of the book's four chapters deal primarily with theme and form; only the first examines historiographic issues in their own right. This imbalance is not necessarily a flaw, but it does illustrate the challenges of interdisciplinary research and writing. Many film scholars will welcome the author's extraordinarily detailed inventory of the strategies used in postcolonial cinema to critique imperialism, particularly the creative subversion (and to a lesser extent, perpetuation) of representational conventions inherited from colonial‐era painting, literature, and movies. On the other hand, cultural historians will likely be disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the life of these films in society, the multiple meanings attached to them by viewers, and their relation to competing discourses of the same era.<br>

Abstract: Now, Benjamin's work had been available in English since 1969, when

But for film studies, aside from “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” he really arrived in 1985 whenNew German Critiquedevoted an entire issue to his relation to cinema, followed by one on Weimar Film Theory. Then came Susan Buck‐Morss to trumpet the arcades project in her 1989The Dialectics of Seeing.
            52Benjamin was suddenly indispensible to the way much film history, especially early cinema, was conceived and written in the U.S. As a measure, the 1995 collectionCinema and the Invention of Modern Lifefinds him invoked in nine of its fourteen selections and cited on forty of its four hundred pages.53For the past ten years, Harvard University Press has been bringing out a huge quantity of Benjamin's writings and correspondence, including last year's“The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility,” and Other Writings on Media.54Benjamin was unquestionably the greatest media theorist before the Second World War, writing brilliantly on photography and radio.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Even in poems that represent prayer in a less agonized light, acts of prayer are not necessarily straightforward. For instance, “Hymn before Sun‐Rise” concludes on a triumphant note, appearing to marry Kantian natural sublimity with a confident Christian prayer: “Tell the stars and tell yon rising sun, / Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God” (lines 84–85). Yet it is the landscape—anthropomorphized mountains, flowers, and streams—rather than the human being that utters this prayer. It is thus, paradoxically, a virtually mute nature that provides the language to and for the speaker. There is a not dissimilar dynamic in “To William Wordsworth,” another poem that seems to crown itself with prayer:
         
               Yet the speaker’s prayer here is constituted primarily as an after‐echo of Wordsworth’s recitation ofI sate, my being blended in one thought(Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound—And when I rose, I found myself in prayer.(lines 109–12)
            The Prelude(which the poem describes); thus, just as in “Hymn before Sun‐Rise,” prayer occurs because the burden of enunciation has been displaced elsewhere—something also marked, I feel, by the uncertain relation of the prayer to the speaker’s volition: “I found myself in prayer.” Thus, these poems evoke successful prayer not because there is no struggle against language but precisely because another language, from elsewhere, has befallen the praying subject. While there is much more to say about the portrayal of prayer and praying in Coleridge’s poetry, even these brief readings provide compelling evidence that prayer—even fulfilled and fulfilling prayer—must pass through a certain agon.<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: The constitution of the ordinary by the excluded, the human by the quasi‐human wolf‐man and the political by the state of exception, demands a new concept of possibility in order to think the political afresh and prevent its downfall into a spiral of pure exceptionality. Agamben states the need clearly: “only if it is possible to think the relation between potentiality and actuality differently—and even to think beyond this relation— … a political theory freed from the aporias of sovereignty remains unthinkable.”
         20Agamben calls for a potency that is freed from any relation to actuality and so freed from any ban. Just as the outcast or bandit is forever marked, by his or her exclusion, by the ban, being calls for a new conception in order to free it from its cancellation or annihilation. Tillich’s writing on prophetic critique can untie this knot by showing and developing the potency of promise and rethinking that relation. Taking up this promise will issue in alternate practices that engage sovereignty without succumbing to its difficulties.<br>

Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The mode that is attributed to the Jew in Lévinas's essay is here called merely nomadic. It is nevertheless clear that the relationship between “man” and the “nomad” mirrors the relation of the anti-Semite to the Jew, as the “nomad” is presented as tied to technology and as such represents a threat to “man.” At the same time that it generalizes Lévinas's text, the opening of Blanchot's essay nonetheless manages to parallel the first paragraph of Lévinas's, even alluding obliquely to Heidegger's critique of flight in “Das Ding.” Within the body of the essay, Blanchot does take up specifically the category of the pagan, declaring that Gagarin's space flight is a threat to the pagan in all of us: he who is tied to enrootedness, to tradition, to his biological race, he who consoles himself among the trees over the evil of mankind. The Jew, however, is not mentioned. Even when Lévinas is paraphrased in the essay it is without specific citation, and he is referred to not as someone who speaks in the name of Judaism but as “the man with no fixed abode,” as a representative of the nomads (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 269). In repeating Lévinas, Blanchot has insisted on resisting the move back to the proper, which Lévinas's essay performs in its emphasis on Judaism's message. Lévinas uses Gagarin's flight to lead back to the truth of Judaism, concluding his own essay with the claim that, like technology, Judaism “has demystified the universe” and, moreover, “has discovered man in the nudity of the face” (“H,” p. 259; “HGU,” p. 234). Blanchot uses Lévinas's essay to remind us that Gagarin tears us away from the proper in
         every sense. His omission of both Lévinas's name and of Judaism underscores the point that deracination as a moral concept would prohibit reappropriation of any kind. The message of Gagarin's speech from space is for no one to claim and for no one to own, that is, that “truth is nomadic” (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 271). Blanchot has thus doubly displaced Lévinas'~<br>

Author(s): Bono James J.<br>
Abstract: Henry Turner's essay returns us to the very notion of “form” to underscore once again this key commonality that ties together literature and science, the literary scholar, the historian of science, and the scientist. In so doing, he works to dispel the text/action dichotomy, in part by noting that the “category of form” itself embraces “meaningful artifacts” of the sort that constitute the very material tools of the trade of the practices through which scientists make scientific knowledge: for example, “physical specimens, instrument readings, photographs, models.” Citing a range of examples that include Francis Bacon and Galileo, Turner importantly insists that form, while critical to making knowledge, is “never simply a tool of knowledge” but, rather, is always about the constitution of things, about “ontology.” Thus the forms utilized by scientists, whatever their particularity as “meaningful artifacts” may be in a given instance, also serve to gather together, to relate and draw into relation with one another, features of an experienced world that form associations as objects and as “enduring network[s]” of things. The final essay, by Colin Milburn, also highlights the dynamic nature of texts, particularly by drawing attention to their ability to constitute themselves as, and hence actively create, “assemblages.” His discussion of the relation of science to science fiction through processes collectively termed “modding” (processes of “reworking and transforming”) points to just this generative and dynamic property of texts that once again underscores the creative and pragmatic conjoining of text and action. By analyzing the specific forms that “mods” take in translating science fiction among “scientists as cultural consumers” into the work of the laboratory, Milburn provides testimony for one possible site where we may witness the continuing role that the fictive might play in science.<br>

Abstract: Setting aside the numerous references to falcons and falconry that have long been recognized as suggesting Dante's acquaintance with the birds, with hunting, and possibly with Frederick the Second's
         De arte venandi cum avibus,52let us look at the metaphors and similes in which he shows his knowledge of creatures. Through poetry, in contrast to philosophy—and even if this were not his purpose—Dante can potentially think his “way into the existence of a bat or a chimpanzee or an oyster, any being,” as J. M. Coetzee describes the power of poets inElizabeth Costello(80). Poetry, in other words, is a means whereby the subject can radically transcend itself in relation to the world of creatures.53This argument, of course, rests on the precise status or function of these similes or analogies in the poem.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Obsessed with his afterlife yet disdaining to be dissolved into God's heaven, Faustus develops a relation in his mind to the devil as his solution to his dilemma. By adopting the “metaphysics of magicians,” Faustus finds a way, he thinks, to control the terms of his own death, securing for himself an eternity of continued embodiment and lack of self-transcendence. Indeed, at first Faustus passionately catalogs the epicurean marvels that he will command his spirits to procure—the “orient pearl” (1.1.85), the “princely delicates” (1.1.87)—but it becomes increasingly clear over the course of the play that whatever worldly rewards magic may afford him are secondary. Thus when Valdes promises Faustus that by magic he will gain fame and sex and money if only he will “be resolute” (1.1.135), Faustus answers in a way that tells more than he knows: “Valdes,” he says, “as resolute am I in this / As thou to live” (1.1.136–37). His resolution to live indicates less Faustus's determination to satisfy himself than his determination to save himself, to use magic to self-create the materialized afterlife, the embodied end, he most ardently desires. Thus the ability to conjure up and play with spirits is what he wants; magical personation enables him to face his own death and what is then to come, for it enables him to experience being, as Faustus believes, already in hell, where he will not only continue to walk, dispute, eat, and give lectures but also participate in delightful entertainments that celebrate personation itself. That is why Faustus is so easily distracted from repentance and doubt by the apparently trivial shows that the devil stages for him, or that he thinks he conjures up himself.
      32Far from being inexplicably minor applications of the exalted magical power Faustus supposedly possesses, those pageants and dumbshows are at the very core of the satisfaction that Faustus looks to magic to afford him. The spirits personating poetic figures give Faustus visible ~<br>

Abstract: Second, what is the relation between practical “reflection” (or decision) and practical reasoning? While no one can choose or avow for me, my reflective avowal must respond to what I take to be reasons, as Larmore’s argument about grounds of commitment contends—and so it cannot “dispense” entirely with reference to others (65). Thus, the authenticity found in practical affirmation or attestation cannot be an experience of complete independence from others (my choice must in principle be intelligible). And so the “irreplaceable nature of each individual life” seen in authentic self-relation (55) cannot be defined negatively as an exclusion of other perspectives: it must instead depend on the energy, effort, or initiative in avowal.<br>

Abstract: This approach, however, is not altogether new. We must be careful not to presume—as Jasper does—“the impossibility of any systematic theology in a time of the unsystematic and aphoristic” (5). Fragment and system are not mutually exclusive. Aphorism acknowledges the apophatic, and a complex Neoplatonic system informs the negative theology that resonates with many of the essays in this volume. Here, it is encouraging that Jasper, Hass, and Kelly Van Andel all invoke Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Van Andel is correct that Coleridge’s theories of symbol and imagination, as well as his practice as a poet, challenge what often passes for literature and theology by celebrating “open ambiguity rather than closed certitude” (212). Coleridge fails to complete his system—his impossible quest for unity—but he nonetheless articulates (through symbol) a systematic method. To understand this, we must recognize the relation of Coleridge’s symbol to traditional allegory and negative theology via a more careful reading of
      The Statesman’s Manual(London, 1816) that considers (contra Van Andel’s overreliance on Thomas McFarland) the hermeneutic and biblical context of the symbol/allegory distinction in Coleridge’s lay sermon. This is a minor but important adjustment that reinforces the larger claim that the tensional practice of literature and theology can revitalize old truths, for “the renewal of traditions is often accomplished through discomforting processes of radical critique” (2).<br>

Author(s): Vásquez Manuel A.<br>
Abstract: When he formulates the basis for his materialism he does something very interesting. Rather than engage the Marxist tradition, with its issue of the relation between an economic base and a cultural superstructure, he turns of all places to phenomenology: “My aim is to recover alternative materialist currents within phenomenology which challenges somatophobic internalism and idealism. These alternative phenomenological currents stress historicity, facticity, enfleshment, and embeddedness in everyday life as the inescapable conditions for [the] construction of selfhood” (59). Several chapters in part 1 offer an extensive reinterpretation of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty in whom Vásquez finds support for a “non-reductive materialism.” As a theorist, Vásquez is a synthetic thinker, artfully blending an array of ideas into a single whole. This makes the book a richly informative work, yet one which sustains a single argument throughout.<br>

Abstract: In summary, the Priestly depiction of these conditions presents us with a paradox. On one hand, the characterization of the spread of pollution as well as the isolation and expiatory offerings required of the impurity bearer hint at an underlying concern with the spread of infection or curse. On the other hand, the biblical materials display an effort to de-emphasize or even deny the danger of infection. Despite these efforts to recontextualize pollution as posing a threat only in relation to the sacred domain, the behaviors associated with these forms of impurity indicate that these conditions were not always perceived to be innocuous.<br>

Abstract: Question six raises the issue of whether the cultural systems that Geertz discusses—religion, ideology, aesthetics—are in fact any more systematically coherent than morality, extending this to the methodological relation between spiritual and moral and between spiritual and evil. Crapanzano is correct to identify the anthropological effacement of both spiritual and evil, though one might refer to both as insistent discursive shadows, rather than actual absences. In question seven, I agree that the reification and gothic characterization of evil may blind us to and add power to the rhetoric of evil. This is part of why anthropologists intuitively avoid evil, and precisely why I insist on the thematization rather than the reification of evil, and avoid the gothic characterization of evil to bring in the ethnology of witchcraft instead. Crapanzano’s attribution of evil to demons and devils in question nine plays into such a gothic characterization. In question eight, I am not certain that the identification of structural/symbolic oppositions qualifies me as a dualist in the usual sense, but certainly the specter of dualism that haunts the category of evil supports my argument for a need to rethink the category. This leads directly to the final question about the amoral and moral indifference. Thematizing evil rather than reifying it allows a distinction between saying “I don’t give a damn,” which is in fact a moral stance, and really not giving a damn, which is truly outside morality—this is related to the distinction between a criminal and a sociopath. Finally, Crapanzano’s reference to the bleaker side of human consociation prompts us to reiterate that evil is better examined not for its own sake but as integral to morality. Certainly amorality and moral indifference have moral and cultural consequences.<br>

Article Title: Milton’s “Unoriginal” Voice: Quotation Marks in<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Milton of course relies on his “celestial patroness” and her nightly visitations in composing his great poem. But what is actually brought to his ear in these unimplored visits? Is it some kind of heavenly matter that is blown into him, the opposite of satanic venom, or is it the very words of the poem? The celestial visitor, he tells us, “dictates to me slumbering
         orinspires / Easy my unpremeditated verse” (9.23–24; emphasis added). Milton here offers two distinct options. Either the poem is “dictated” to him, exactly as he will dictate it to another the following morning, or he is inspired—visited by a heavenly influx that then allows him to speak forth words of his own making. The same uncertainty we saw in the case of Eve and again in the serpent is repeated, or perhaps finds its source, in Milton’s own inscribed uncertainty. With this single “or,” Milton relegates the whole of his epic to that uncertain space between quotation and creation in which we have seen so many of the poem’s speakers working. Milton, Eve, and the serpent are all visited at night by an influence of some kind, and the next day they speak forth words that may or may not be their own. If the words are “dictated” to him, then perhaps Milton can put the entire poem in quotation marks, taking a profoundly unoriginal stance in relation to his masterpiece. But even critics who see the dream voice as coming entirely from outside of Eve are unlikely to say the same about Milton’s relation to his poem, despite the structural similarity of the two interactions. Just as Eve is somehow involved in the dream voice, so is Milton involved in all of his utterances, whether they belong on the page to Satan, God, Adam, Eve, or Belial. In his depictions of Eve and the serpent, Milton offers us a glimpse into his own anxious work as maker. Like them, he too woke up full of wild and sometimes blasphemous words, which he would then have to speak forth in the light of day to pious (if not sinless) audit~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Few have experienced the consequences of religion being used by the political order as a tool to mobilize forces for its agendas more acutely than Bonhoeffer. Bethge, his closest friend to whom most prison letters were addressed, asks rhetorically, “Is there not concealed behind our religious trends our ungovernable urge toward … power—in the name of God to do what
         wewant, and in the name of the Christian worldview to stir up and play people against one another?”
               Those immersed in the forms of religion that legitimate their own culture are particularly susceptible to ignorance regarding the deep connection between religion and the will to power. Unlike religious institutions (in the Bonhoefferian sense), the church that is rooted in Jesus’s being for others has the potential to offer the world a vision that relativizes all social orders.155
            
               Commenting on Matt. 7:21, where Jesus says, “Not all who say to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven,” Bonhoeffer warns against “a kind of confession of Christ that Jesus rejects because it is in contradiction with doing the will of God.”156
            
               Jesus rejects such a confession, Bonhoeffer, explains, “because it arises out of our own human knowledge of good and evil.”157
            
               Therefore, the ecclesia must always remain aware of the danger consisting in a religious dogmatism that equips the believer with the categories of good and evil without incorporating personal relation with God as the measure against which his or her life is to be discerned.158

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak is concerned with the relation between philosophy and faith, more than any other topic, however. Following his phenomenology of philosophical conversation, he claims, “The encounter with God is somewhat comparable to a face-to-face relationship that stretches me when I look up to a human person who loves me. Since God is infinite, however, faith and love toward God encompass the universe of all that exists. … Faith thus mobilizes and orients the entirety of one’s existence from top to bottom” (120–21). Peperzak regards faith as a fundamental Desire that orients us in an encounter with the absolute. As such, there is no clean separation of faith and philosophy. All thinking emerges from some sort of faith, and while philosophy has a universality that can engender conversation across differences of faith orientation, its autonomy is a relative and limited one. Moreover, Peperzak associates the infinity of God encountered as Other with the Platonic Good that illuminates all thinking and being, while itself escaping thematization: “the
      phila(love) ofphilosophiareaches out toward a wisdom (sophia) that implies … a sense of the difference between this cosmos and the ultimately desired but ungiven Good. … By longing, Eros reaches further than any theory” (159).<br>

Abstract: The intimate relation of philosophy and history has given rise to a series of issues concerning the “question of time.” This book provides an extensive history of a central problem in the philosophy of time, and opens the preface with the question: “Can time exist independently of consciousness or mind?” J. J. A. Mooij addresses the history of this question and analyzes the answers and arguments extended on its behalf in their historical context. The historical scope extends from classical antiquity to the year 2000. Although one may have opined that “the problem of Time and Mind had been solved” either “by Newton around 1700, by Kant around 1800,” or “ by Bergson around 1900,” Mooij maintains, the question remains “open today” (p. 261).<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: Analogy or proportion is when the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. We may then use the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth. Sometimes too we qualify the metaphor by adding the term to which the proper word is relative. Thus the cup is to Dionysus as the shield to Ares. The cup may, therefore, be called “the shield of Dionysus”, and the shield “the cup of Ares”. Or, again, as old age is to life, so is evening to day. Evening may therefore be called, “the old age of the day” and old age, “the evening of life”, or, in the phrase of Empedocles, “life’s setting sun”. For some of the terms of the proportion there is at times no word in existence; still the metaphor may be used. For instance, to scatter seed is called sowing: but the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed. Hence the expression of the poet “sowing the god-created light”. There is another way in which this kind of metaphor may be employed. We may apply an alien term, and then deny of that term one of its proper attributes; as if we were to call the shield, not “the cup of Ares” but “the wineless cup”. (

Abstract: Archaeological excavations in the last fifty years have changed this, contributing to a great number of scholarly works in various fields. However, as Wu points out, many art-historical studies of Chinese tombs tend to be formal analyses of individual objects in museum collections, in which little attempt is made to explain an object’s visual characteristics in relation to its original function or symbolism. Following recent trends in Chinese art history, Wu argues that instead of studying discrete objects—which, he implies, compromises the overall “integrity of a tomb”— we should treat the tomb space, artifacts, and images as part of an interrelated whole. More importantly, because tombs make up a unique category of art specifically designed for the dead, not the living, the scholar must reconsider the utility of employing our traditional art-historical methodologies in analyzing tombs (12–13).<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Abstract: Drawing on my own fieldwork experiences with the transnational Integral Yoga community, this essay offers some reflections on two possible approaches to bridging insider-outsider perspectives in the study of new religious movements. First, I consider Gerald Larson's suggestion of a “relationship of mutual reciprocity” between researcher and religious community. Second, I discuss the value of a participatory approach that attempts to integrate engaged participation with critical distance in the study of religion. I use my collaborative experience co-authoring an academic article on Sri Aurobindo and the contemporary yoga scene with an Integral Yoga practitioner to argue that while Larson's reciprocal enterprise risks either sacrificing critical concerns to apologetic agendas, or polarizing the insider as apologetic and the outsider as reductive, a participatory approach proposes a way to put insider-outsider perspectives into a more creative relation.<br>

Abstract: On enigma as a rhetorical figure: a brief history in the rhetoricians, encyclopedists, and patristic commentators from Aristotle to Dante's time, with a rhetorical analysis of the figure. Special attention is given to Augustine in the
         De trinitateXV on St. Paul's well-known "in aenigmate" (I Cor.13:12). Some implications of Augustine's linking of the figurative and the figural (typological, historical) are considered, with a re-examination of Auerbach's "Figura" on this question. The importance for our own reading of rhetoric in relation to history and poetry is stressed.<br>

Abstract: In this cranky and arrogant chapter I consider several aspects of my use of symbolic interactionist perspectives on my research and thinking. The following are the elements of the chapter: (1) the historical context of my initial encounter with symbolic interactionism (SI); (2) my interpretation of key ideas of SI; (3) its relation to specific research of mine; (4) the relation of other perspectives to my research; and (5) some critiques of SI. I conclude with a truncated discussion of my dissatisfaction with the overtheorizing and overscientizing of sociology. Seeking balance, I end with predictions of a grand and glorious future.<br>

Abstract: "The written words of the Adi
Granth function quite differently from the written words of ordinary books or even of other
scriptures. In Sikh devotion, the written words fulfil the same function as that of a musical
score in relation to the performed music. Just as written music has no value until it is per-
formed, so the written text of the Adi Granth has spiritual power only as it is sung. . . . This
is why the devotional experience of scripture cannot be had from translations-just as it
is impossible to translate a Bach fugue into some other form" (p. 134)<br>

Abstract: The cross-cultural program of research presented here is about matters of temporal persistence-personal persistence and cultural persistence-and about solution strategies for solving the paradox of "sameness-in-change." The crux of this paradox resides in the fact that, on threat of otherwise ceasing to be recognizable as a self, all of us must satisfy at least two constitutive conditions. The first of these is that selves are obliged to keep moving or die, and, so, must continually change. The second is that selves must also somehow remain the same, lest all notions of moral responsibility and any commitment to an as yet unrealized future become nonsensical. Although long understood as a problem demanding the attention of philosophers, we argue that this same paradox arises in the ordinary course of identity development and dictates the different developmental routes taken by culturally mainstream and Aboriginal youth in coming to the identity-preserving conclusion that they and others are somehow continuous through time. Findings from a set of five studies are presented. The first and second studies document the development and refinement of a method for parsing and coding what young people say on the topic of personal persistence or self-continuity. Both studies demonstrate that it is not only possible to seriously engage children as young as age 9 or 10 years in detailed and codable discussions about personal persistence, but that their reasoning concerning such matters typically proceeds in an orderly and increasingly sophisticated manner over the course of their early identity development. Our third study underscores the high personal costs of failing to sustain a workable sense of personal persistence by showing that failures to warrant self-continuity are strongly associated with increased suicide risk in adolescence. Study four documents this same relation between continuity and suicide, this time at the macrolevel of whole cultures, and shows that efforts ~<br>

Article Title: Toward an Ontology of Relativism<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the relation of authority to legitimacy through the social construction of local histories that validate claims to 'authentic' rulership. Using the historical example of the Chiefdom of Uyombe in northern Zambia, I intend to argue that the construction of these local histories has been a crucial element in the process of domination, subjugation, resistance and collaboration between rulers and those they would rule. Exploring specific Gramscian concepts, I will also argue that historical narratives contain hegemonic and ideological components that are critical to relating authority to legitimacy in an active manner. These narratives contain African voices, which express varied local interests. Through the narratives, Africans may be seen as active agents in contributing to the making of their own local histories of rulership. Thus, authority and legitimacy are conjoined through the fabrication, inscription and recitation of historical narratives and are an essential part of governance.<br>

Publisher: Philosophy of Science Association<br>

Abstract: The author proposes the thesis that all perception, including observation in natural science, is hermeneutical as well as causal; that is, the perceiver (or observer) learns to 'read' instrumental or other perceptual stimuli as one learns to read a text. This hermeneutical aspect at the heart of natural science is located where it might be least expected, within acts of scientific observation. In relation to the history of science, the question is addressed to what extent the hermeneutical component within scientific observation opens natural science to the charge of reflecting merely cultural values, and of providing merely a culturally acceptable reading of the "Book of Nature", rather than, as the author states, one stating universal antecedent conditions of possibility of cultural activity itself.<br>

Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i210405<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Hall John R.<br>
Abstract: Conventionally, proposals to improve working relations between sociology and history have been interdisciplinary. The present essay advances an alternative approach-consolidation of sociohistorical inquiry as a transdisciplinary enterprise. All socio-historical inquiry depends on four elemental forms of discourse: discourse on values, narrative discourse, social theoretical discourse, and the discourse of explanation. Though inquiry is transdisciplinary in the problematics of these discourses, concrete methodology typically is oriented either toward theorization in relation to cases (historical sociology) or toward comprehensive analysis of a single phenomenon (sociological history). Varying the articulated relations among the four forms of discourse once for historical sociology and again for sociological history yields eight ideal typical strategies of inquiry. The four strategies of historical sociology include universal history, theory application, macro-analytic history, and contrast-oriented comparison. The parallel strategies for sociological history are situational history, specific history, configurational history, and historicism. These ideal types offer standard reference points that help clarify the underpinnings of a diverse range of scholarly practices.<br>

Author(s): Birth Kevin<br>
Abstract: Johannes Fabian's "Time and the Other" criticized anthropology for creating representations that placed the Other outside the flow of time. Fabian offered the ethnographic portrayal of coevalness as a solution to this problem. This article explores four challenges to the representation of coevalness: the split temporalities of the ethnographer; the multiple temporalities of different histories; the culturally influenced phenomenological present; and the complicated relationship between culturally variable concepts of being and becoming and cultural concepts of time. Based on these challenges, this article argues that some attempts at ethnographic coevalness have fostered a temporal framework of homochronism which subsumes the Other into academic discourses of history. To achieve coevalness and to avoid homochronism and allochronism, it is necessary to represent the temporal frameworks that research subjects use to forge coevalness with ethnographers, and to place these frameworks in relationship to commonly used academic representations of time and history. /// Dans son livre "Le Temps et les Autres," Johannes Fabian critiquait la création par l'anthropologie de représentations plaçant l'Autre en dehors du flux du temps. Selon lui, la description ethnographique de la contemporanéité pourrait être la solution à ce problème. Le présent article explore les quatre difficultés que pose la représentation de la contemporanéité: temporalités dissociées de l'ethnographe, temporalités multiples des différentes histoires, présent phénoménologique culturellement informé, relation complexe entre les concepts culturellement variables de l'être et du devenir et les concepts culturel du temps. Sur la base de ces difficultés, l'auteur avance que certaines tentatives de contemporanéité ethnographique ont suscité un cadre temporel d'homochronie qui subsume l'Autre dans les discours académiques sur l'histoire. Pour parvenir à la contemporanéité et éviter homochronie et allochronie, il ~<br>

Publisher: The Johns Hopkins University Press<br>
Issue: i20486733<br>
Date: 2 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Addis Adeno<br>
Abstract: The assertion of prescriptive and adjudicative universal jurisdictions by some countries in relation to a handful of offenses that are classified as international or universal crimes (e.g. genocide) has led to a great deal of controversy. Those who favor universal jurisdiction argue that certain acts (often crimes) affect all of us, not just the specific individual or group of victims or the country of which the victims are nationals. It is therefore legitimate, they argue, for any state to punish or suppress such acts regardless of any traditional jurisdictional connection between the alleged acts and the state asserting jurisdiction. The availability of universal jurisdiction is premised on the presumed effect of certain crimes on humanity as a whole. Those who commit these offenses are referred to as hostis humani generis--enemies of human kind. Skeptics argue that the idea of universal jurisdiction is conceptually incoherent, inconsistent with the principle of political self-determination, and has great potential to be an instrument of political mischief. While they disagree on the conceptual coherence and utility of the notion of universal jurisdiction, both proponents and opponents view its function in purely instrumental terms, to provide the condition for punishing or suppressing certain offenses that affect all of us. This article argues that universal jurisdiction also serves another, less articulated purpose. It has a constitutive function as well. It is partly a process through which the identity of the international community is imagined and enacted. It is an expression of a sense of ourselves (a community of humankind) at given moments of time. This article argues that neglect of this constitutive dimension leads to an incomplete analysis of universal jurisdiction.<br>

Abstract: This overview of research in the field of anthropology seeks to offer an introduction into different directions and debates on the outlines of anthropological research and tries to relate the discussion in the German academic context to the Anglo-American context. It differentiates four fields: philosophical anthropology, historical anthropology, "Interkulturalität" (inter-cultural relations) and cultural anthropology, and focuses on theoretical and methodological reflections and on interdisciplinary debates relating to literary studies. The German philosophical anthropology with it's sources in the Enlightenment tried to establish an universal concept of what the human being originally is or could be. The historical anthropology has criticised this concept of an unchangeable human nature because it doesn't take into account the historical changes and diversities of the development of human beings. Nevertheless in the German context both fields remained for a long time dominated by universalistic assumptions and critical debates about relativism. Only in the last years philosophical, historical, and literary research begin to interest in inter-cultural relations, in ethnology, and in Anglo-American cultural anthropology establishing a differentiated relation to ethnic or cultural otherness. These fields are also influenced by the "linguistic turn" and the "interpretative anthropology" focusing on the role of language and on modes of representation and symbolising. The overview is connected to a selected (and partly commented) bibliography.<br>

Author(s): Cormier Philippe<br>
Abstract: Le dépassement phénoménologique du substantialisme métaphysique devrait permettre aujourd'hui d'envisager une refondation de la notion de personne, laquelle s'était quelque peu immobilisée depuis Boèce. Sur ce nouvel horizon, le retour à la fondation première, celle d'Augustin, s'impose. Celui-ci est le premier en effet, pour l'essentiel dans son traité de la Trinité, à avoir clairement pensé la personne (divine) comme relation et non comme substance. La réduction augustinienne de la personne (humaine) à l'ego ou à « l'homme intérieur » ouvre la possibilité d' « analogies subjectives » avec la Trinité: pensée, amour, connaissance; mémoire, intelligence, volonté. Cependant, la spéculation augustinienne trouve sa limite en échouant à penser une personne de chair — et, qui plus est, une telle personne comme « en relation ». Ce qui était relation en Dieu reste, en l'homme, substance pensante, seule face à son Dieu. Phenomenology has overcome the old substance of metaphysics and then should permit us today to refound the idea of the person which was in a way, since Boethius, brought to a standstill. Therefore we must to go back to St. Augustine who was actually the first, in his De Trinitate, to conceive, the (divine) person as a relation and not as a substance. The (human) person so confined to the ego or to the « inner man » allows some possible « subjective analogies » with the Trinity: thought, love, knowledge, memory, intelligence and will. However the Augustinian theory fails to conceive first the person in her own flesh and blood — a bodily person — and secondly such a person as being « in relation »: man is a thinking substance, alone facing her God.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'efforce de montrer comment le roman de John Barth LETTERS opère une réorientation radicale de la relation classique entre histoire et fiction. Glissant de la représentation incertaine du réel dans la fiction — et de l'Histoire dans l'histoire — à la notion plus productive du réel comme fiction, LETTERS utilise le discours de/et sur l'Histoire comme une métaphore de la fiction qui éclaire de façon précieuse le fonctionnement du récit. This essay attempts to show how John Barth's novel LETTERS radically reorients the classical relationship between history and fiction. Shifting from the uncertain representation of the real inside the fiction — and of History within the story — to the more productive notion of the real as a fiction, LETTERS uses the discourse of/and about History as a metaphor of fiction which sheds valuable light on the functioning of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: This paper suggests Charles Reznikoff's poetry should be assessed in its relation to the Jewish hermeneutical tradition. Philosopher Paul Ricœur's quotation in the title, "the very deciphering of life in the mirror of the text," sums up Reznikoff's poetical strategy. He decontextualizes his writing by displacing it towards its hypotextual origin, Jewish and non-Jewish. Reading destabilizes the reader who embraces the poetical text in the mirror of its hypotexts. This move metaphorically takes reading and writing away from their familiar American grounds and paves the way for an ethics of perambulation.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a comparative study of the tributes paid to the American philosopher John Rawls, in France and the United States, after his death in November 2010. Whereas in the U.S. tributes to Rawls appeared in scholarly journals, in France they did in political magazines and general interest media. Besides, the focus in U.S. journals on Rawls's philosophical commitments is at odds with the emphasis placed by the French media on the political interpretations of his theory of justice. The contrast between Rawls's French and U.S. "funerals" is a consequence of the way intellectual fields in France and the U.S. differ in their relation to politics. While Rawls conformed with what was expected of him in the American academia by staying away from politics almost all his life, he was seen in France as an intellectuel engagé, the typical figure of intellectual life since the Dreyfus case. The contrast between the French and American reactions to Rawls's death is also related to the fact that those who first got interested in his theory of justice in France were supporters of the anti-totalitarian left or center-right, rather than academic philosophers.<br>

Abstract: The works of Tiryakian, Bruyn and Douglas are examined as representative of "phenomenological sociology." Radical problems are discovered in their use of key concepts in phenomenology: intention, reduction, phenomenon and essence. These problems are shown to arise out of a failure to grasp the nature of the phenomenological enterprise and its relationship to sociology. Turning back to the original formulation of this relationship by Husserl, we discover problems of transcendental intersubjectivity, of type and essence, and of objectivism. We then point out the existence of sociologies which do not share the shortcomings of what is called phenomenological sociology, yet which make use of the perspective and approach of phenomenology. We then focus on one of these sociologies, ethnomethodology in its relation to phenomenology. We find parallels in their methodology and domains of inquiry, and divergency in their approaches to intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical
semantics: "The historian does not interest himself only with the relation between the
sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une
semantique historique," in Melanges en honneur de F. Braudel [Toulouse, 1973],

Abstract: Comparative analysis is taken into account in relation to recent changes in social theory. By distinguishing different ways of doing comparative research, their limits and potentialities, the A. highlights the close link between social theory and empirical research. More precisely, the A. holds that only after a critical re-examination of this link it is possible to explain the role played by comparative analysis on the theory of social action during the last decades.<br>

Abstract: The process by which a neophyte approaches a religious group has a particular interest. The importance of the relation between leader and followers is thus revealed. The symbolic manipulation of charisms is the fundamental instrument allowing to maintain leadership. The steps of conversion, testimony and prophecy are decisive. Thus the deep link between charism and word is unveiled: the talk involves different modalities in the use of the word, the final interpretation of whic is always given by the charismatic leader.<br>

Issue: i23005171<br>
Date: 3 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): CEREDA AMBROGIA<br>
Abstract: The article analyses the meaning of tattooing as a form of narration. Introducing the body as a text that can convey different forms of thought (derived both from philosophy and from sociology), the author maintains that the body modification is today as an open and living work whose interpretation has an influence on the individual identity and can be changed by means of the interaction with others. A thumbnail sketch of the history of the practice among traditional communities up to contemporary society is drawn to provide a series of fundamental usages for the inscription of the body. The concern here is to show tattooing as an expression of the whole individual (no longer divided into mind vs. body) and of his own perceived identity, underlying the relation of the chosen symbols (and of the symbolic ritual) with society, which remains the main source offering forms of representation and the main stage for the construction of identity. So that the whole final text can be read as the result of a process where the authorship is shattered among the society itself.<br>

Abstract: Depuis les années 1980, la littérature de voyage a retenu l'intérêt des historiens et des littératures. Mais quels regards ont-ils portés sur le statut générique de ces textes? Plus précisément, comment ont-ils envisagé les relations entre récit de voyage et fiction? Des différentes approches proposées, que l'on comprendra ici dans une évolution des paradigmes en sciences humaines, on retiendra la méfiance générale sur le genre viatique et le monolithisme théorique, témoins d'une définition insuffisante du récit de voyage. Le présent article, faisant appel aux récents débats autour du statut ontologique et anthropologique de la fiction, cherche à distinguer, sur la base d'un corpus de récits de voyage circonstancié (le voyage français au Tibet au tournant du XXe siècle), la diversité des phénomènes fictionnels au sein du récit de voyage, au loin d'une conception figée de leurs relations. Si les définitions « locales » et les usages multiples de la fiction plaident pour un traitement au cas par cas, il ressort également de l'analyse que, dans le contexte propre à la situation interculturelle que présente le récit de voyage, la fiction demande à être envisagée dans ses vertus heuristiques. Since the 1980s, travel literature has attracted the interest of historians and students of literature. What view have they adopted of the generic status of such texts? How have they conceived of the relation between travel accounts and fiction? In the different approaches proposed (understood herein as a shift in the paradigms of human sciences), we notice a general mistrust of travel narratives and a « theoretical monolithism », this being evidence of an inadequate definition of the genre. A reference to recent debates about fiction's ontological and anthropological status serves to discern the diversity of fictional phenomena in a corpus of detailed French accounts of travels in Tibet at the turn of the 20th century. The « local » definitions and multiple uses of fiction call for~<br>

déterminer « l'être de la conscience intentionnelle », à parler d'une « détermina-
tion réflexive de la conscience » et à insister sur l'« intentionnalité privilégiée de la
réflexion » (id., p. 54). Son interprétation du Supplément IX des Leçons de 1905 est
également marquée par cette lecture flnkéenne : « L'autoapparition rétentionnelle
du flux de la conscience serait donc une simple anticipation d'une conscience de
soi qui ne se réaliserait pleinement que sous la forme d'une perception réflexive. »
(Id., p. 289.) La relation de fondation que Husserl établit dans les Leçons entre
rétention et réflexion est ainsi invertie en une téléologie de la réflexion.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: SUMNER TWISS HAS ARGUED THAT HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION NEEDS TO be expanded to include work that traditionally is beyond the horizon of human rights literature. Specifically, human rights education could benefit from inclusion of humanistic genres such as novels, poetry, film, drama, and music, which engage our critical and emotional capacities. Examination of humanistic literature in relation to human rights atrocities might provide important and new insights into the causes of human rights abuses. In this essay I suggest that although Twiss identifies an important area for further reflection, there are some reasons to worry about the possibility of blurring genres that his proposal entails. I also suggest that we need to develop criteria for evaluating the kinds of experiential arguments that are frequently embedded in the literature Twiss highlights.<br>

Abstract: The author studies systematically the internal criteria which he considers most valid, in so far as they are critically established, for providing access through the gospels to Jesus and for guaranteeing the historical authenticity of his life and message. After placing the problem of establishing valid criteria (la critériologie) in the context of the current critical study of the gospels and offering a number of critical observations designed to avoid confusions (especially the distinction between pure data, criteria and proof; between literary and historical criteria; between criteria and the intellectual attitudes that thereby follow), the author presents and discusses seven criteria which he groups under three headings: basic criteria (critères fondamentaux), dependent criteria (critères dérivés), and composite criteria (critères mixtes). Among the basic criteria he discusses: 1. the criterion of multiple testimony, together with the principal objection which can be raised against it, i.e. the extent to which one can speak of independent sources with regard to the gospels since all derive from oral tradition; 2. the criterion of discontinuity, considered on the levels of form and content; 3. the criterion of conformity (or of continuity or coherence), including the different formulations which contemporary exegetes propose, as well as its connections with the criterion of discontinuity; 4. the criterion of required explanation (explication nécessaire) or of sufficient reason for a group of convergent and well-attested facts. As an example of a dependent criterion called such since it is established in relation to the basic criteria, the author proposes the living, personal style of Jesus as distinguished from the gospels' literary style. Finally, among the composite criteria, that is to say the cases where an important literary characteristic is linked with one or several historical criteria, he mentions: the internal intelligibility of an account or of a group~<br>

Abstract: This Study is divided in three parts. The first treats the problem of the relation between Scripture and reason considered as Springs of Moral Theology. Why a recourse to Bible should be necessary if conscience is already a Spring of moral knowledge? What kind of Priority has, for christian conscience, the Authority of the Gospel? The answer is that the light of the Gospel and the light of Reason are not two independant possibilities: there is interaction and complementarity between them: both Scripture and human Reason can be said to be, together, the soul of Moral Theology. The second part is about Hermeneutics. How can we apply the written Gospel to every day's reality? Exegesis tells me what the biblical text is saying: the text speaks. Hermeneutics tells me what the biblical text is saying to the modern man: the text speaks today. Hermeneutics try to liberate the actual meaning of the biblical text. In the third Part, the dialectic between faith and reason is applied to the moral of S. Paul. What was Paul's Filter in front of hellenism? How did he manage to borrow some principles of morality from the current morality and to refuse some others? What was his originality? How did he use Faith and Reason in building up his moral doctrine?<br>

Abstract: Gli studi sistematici della traduzione, che inseguono il profilo scientifico delle teorie e cercano di individuare i tratti metodologici da attribuire all'attività pratica, la molteplicità di indirizzi e soluzioni delle teorie logiche e filosofiche del linguaggio, le frastagliate posizioni della semiotica, la pluralità delle visioni antropologiche connesse al multiforme orizzonte della riflessione ermeneutica concorrono ad alimentare il problema speculativo della traduzione, configurabile nel nodo che si stringe tra identità e alterità. Esso viene qui affrontato in relazione a B. Lonergan non limitandosi all'esperienza di traduzione di Insight, ma enucleando il problema stesso del tradurre che Lonergan dovette personalmente affrontare studiando S. Tommaso. In particolare ci si sofferma sul significato della parola insight già ben presente in Verbum, delle cui valenze occorre farsi carico allorché ci si sposta sul fronte dell'opera Insight, purché al tempo stesso ci si apra a riconoscere la rinnovata e impetuosa vena che la contraddistingue. Un ricognizione sulla traduzione dell'aggettivo actual focalizza l'esigenza di comprendere ogni singola parola nei plurimi contesti, così come di interpretarli. Systematic studies of translation which follow the scientific profile of theories and seek to individuate the methodological features that should be attributed to practical activity, the multiplicity of directions and solutions of logical and philosophical theories of language, the many facets of semiotics, the plurality of anthropological approaches tied into the multiform horizons of hermeneutical reflection, combine to increase the speculative problem of translation, which takes shape in the nexus between identity and otherness. These issues are examined in relation to B. Lonergan: not just regarding the experience of translating Insight but also through analysing the difficulty of translation which Longergan himself had to face in studying Aquinas. In particular, ther~<br>

Abstract: Johann Georg Hamann saw the written word of God as the ultimate consequence of his incarnation. The biblical texts as well also carry the death of Christ in their essence as a figure of incarnation. Roland Barthes called the process of putting these texts into writing, by which the text gains autonomy in relation to the author, the "death of the author". In terms of the theology of the Holy Scriptures, this idea can be connected to the way people have been talking about the death of God in the modern age. One must however distinguish between the death of the author and the death of the text. This occurs when exegesis does not want to accept the death of the author. When however during reading there is a new understanding of biblical texts, this means to a certain extent their resurrection.<br>

Abstract: À ceux qui ont pu s'étonner de l'estimation globalement positive de la phrénologie par Auguste Comte, les historiens et les philosophes des sciences ont pu opposer des arguments épistémologiques et méthodologiques convaincants, qui permettent de rendre raison de l'engouement comtien pour une entreprise souvent considérée aujourd'hui comme irrémédiablement pseudo-scientifique. Pourtant, il existe d'autres motivations, de nature politique ou — comme Comte le dirait lui-même — sociologique, qui nous paraissent pouvoir expliquer cet engouement mais qui n'ont pas jusqu'ici reçu la même attention. En effet, la « physiologie phrénologique » fournit à l'édifice comtien la base d'une authentique « théorie de la nature humaine » à partir de laquelle penser l'organisation ou la réorganisation des sociétés occidentales. Ce rôle crucial dévolu à la phrénologie n'est quant à lui que l'illustration d'une spécificité encore plus générale du système comtien, à savoir le rapport privilégié, dans l'ordre de la connaissance, qui unit sociologie et biologie. Or, pour bien saisir toute la difficulté du problème du rapport biologie/sociologie chez Comte, il est éclairant de considérer la manière dont il s'articule dans le cas précis de la question de l'égalité des sexes. Ce que nous aimerions mettre en évidence, en nous appuyant plus particulièrement sur la correspondance de Comte et John Stuart Mill lue à la lumière du Cours de philosophie positive, c'est la manière dont la biologie, et en particulier la phrénologie, œuvre de manière souterraine au cœur même de l'argument sociologique de Comte en faveur de l'assujettissement des femmes et les conséquences potentielles de cette « contamination » biologique. To those who have been puzzled by the globally positive assessment Auguste Comte made of phrenology, historians and philosophers of science have responded by offering convincing epistemological and methodological arguments, which enable one to suggest a rationale for his interest in wh~<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: La théorie de la «Ungleichzeitigkeit» de Ernst Bloch definit le rapport de superstructures et de structure économique comme un rapport d'autonomie relative. Les différences entre la conception de Bloch et la définition de cette corrélation d'Althusser ne doivent pas être cachées. Néanmoins il est distinct que les conceptions, qui sont conciliées avec la discussion de Marx, Gramsci et Max Weber, convergent en tant qu'elles tâchent d'élaborer des déclarations utilisables sur l'état et sur la base sociale de l'idéologie. La confrontation des deux conceptions prouve être appropriée d'avancer la recherche de l'idéologie. Ernst Bloch's theory of "Ungleichzeitigkeit" defines the relation between superstructures and economic structure as a relation of relative autonomy. The differences between Bloch's conception and Althusser's definition of this correlation should not be conceiled. Nevertheless it becomes evident that the conceptions which are both reconciled to the discussion of Marx, Gramsci and Max Weber converge in so far as they try to elaborate sound assertions of the status and the social basis of ideology. The confrontation of both conceptions proves to be appropriate to advance in the research of ideology.<br>

Publisher: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS<br>
Issue: i23714806<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): BANKS SARAH<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the ethical implications of recent changes in social work, particularly in relation to the conception of social workers as professionals guided by a code of ethics. These changes include the fragmentation of the occupation, the increasing proceduralization of the work and the growing focus on consumer rights and user participation. Some people have argued that codes of ethics are becoming increasingly irrelevant in this climate, in that they assume a unified occupational group and are based upon professionals' definition of values without consultation with service users. On the other hand, it has also been maintained that it is ever more important to retain and strengthen codes of ethics in order to maintain professional identity and to defend the work of the profession from outside attack. This paper explores the relevance of a code of professional ethics for social work, focusing particularly on the British Association of Social Workers' code, in the context of the changing organization and practice of the work. It considers two alternative approaches: the 'new consumerism' which focuses on the worker's technical skills (rather than professional ethics) and consumer rights (as opposed to professional obligations); and a 'new radicalism' which stresses the worker's own personal or political commitment and individual moral responsibility (as opposed to an externally imposed code of professional ethics). It is concluded that the changes in social work do threaten the notion of a single set of professional ethics articulated in a code, and that, in some types of work, this model is less appropriate. However, there is still mileage in retaining and developing a code of ethics, not as an imposed set of rules developed by the professional association, but as part of a dynamic and evolving ethical tradition in social work and as a stimulus for debate and reflection on changing and contradictory values.<br>

The author, in a first part, proposes a definition of the concept of legacy in political parties in general. In a second time, he analyzes the policies of legacy in the Italian and French Communist parties. These CP have a different relation with their past because they choose different strategies: strategy of breakdown with Communist experience in Italy and, on the opposite, strategy of continuity for the French Communist party.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le déb~<br>

Abstract: This is based on research that has discovered crucial, hitherto unknown biographical information. First, I review the theories of authors who helped to generate the whole 'affair' of Durkheim's two pre-names, most often in seeing it as a way to interrogate his relation with Judaism. Next, I discuss how the issue comes with elements that are incomplete or inexact. It is then to present new evidence of Durkheim's ambivalence and changing attitude towards his first, identifiably Jewish pre-name. The census records during his time at Bordeaux show that he registered himself as 'David' in 1891 and 1896, but abandoned this and switched to 'Émile' in 1901. Accordingly, I examine possible interpretations of the change, in terms of the political context of the Dreyfus Affair, events in his family life, his institutional position, his growing reputation, and a programme of research in which he resolved on a scientific treatment of religion.<br>

Abstract: In this study we relate four different measures: the theodicy models proposed by van der Ven, the coping strategies proposed by Pargament, a measure of positive or negative self-image and the post critical belief scales we ourselves have developed. We analysed the data of 251 Dutch-speaking Belgians. In the analysis we focus on the relation of the different measures with the post critical belief scales. Different types of believers are using different theodicy models, somewhat different coping strategies and we observe some differences in self-image, where believers have a more positive self-image than non-believers. We could suggest that there is a specific theodicy model used by symbolic believers and another theodicy model used by more literal believers. The former could be interpreted as more developed and perhaps more religiously mature.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23918936<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Westerink Herman<br>
Abstract: In this article it is argued that the apparent vagueness and broadness of the concept 'spirituality' and the difficulty in finding an agreeable definition for it are related to the different meanings of the concept within different intellectual and religious contexts and, subsequently, to different valuations of spirituality in relation to religion and lived religiosity. This article also examines the concept spirituality in the context of the psychology of religion's historical entanglement with theology. On the one hand, the psychology of religion has emancipated itself from theological discourse and theological institutions. On the other hand, the psychology of religion is still closely connected to a modernist theological project of founding religiousness in a province of the mind that resists religious critique of traditional contents and institutional structures in a secular era. The author pleas for more differentiation between theistic and non-theistic dimensions of the concept spirituality.<br>

Abstract: Mandala is a Korean film that follows the careers of two Buddhist monks who pursue antithetical forms of religious practice—meditative selfcultivation, and antinomian pursuit of freedom. Mandala culminates in the enlightenment of both, as they come to realize the limits intrinsic in self-absorption in either form. The paper seeks to explore the larger ethical issues posed in the film in relation to their background in Mahayana Buddhism and to show their applicability in our own cultural setting to the emergence of a 'theological humanism', which articulates various forms of transcendence or depth experienced in the midst of human life.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Abstract: Is liability insurance simply a necessary evil in today's climate of litigation? Or does it have greater implications beyond its social and economic remit? In this article, I argue that when the insurance policy is viewed hermeneutically as a text, its negligence-based definition of action supplants the understanding of responsibility, therefore having theological and philosophical implications. Insurance, in this sense, comes 'in between' humanity and its relation to others and fundamental ontological questions concerning the meaning of uncertainty and suffering.<br>

Author(s): Picone Michelangelo<br>
Abstract: The problem that Petrarch's Canzoniere poses for the modern reader is the same as that posed by all collections of poems assembled by their author: it is a matter of understanding the connection between each of the poems and the collection, the relation between the whole and the parts. On the one hand, the collection presents a discontinuous series of poems composed separately that can be read as discrete works; on the other hand, the same poems come together as part of a love and/or existential story. Our task is to study the Canzoniere as a macrotext and to clarify the relation of each of the compositions to the collection of lyric verse to which it belongs. Petrarch's desperate attempt to complete his work is the same hopeless challenge that the mythical Arachne dared to make to Minerva. At the deepest level Petrarch reveals an awareness of the fact that every human endeavor is a spider's web that is woven in the course of a lifetime, and thus is never completed. The destiny of human beings therefore is to weave a tapestry that is never finished, just as the fate of the poet is to write an in-finite work; namely, a work that in the end can never reach the perfection and integrity of the divine work.<br>

Abstract: Text interpretation – the main interest of discourse analysts – is a central component of the text understanding process. In this article we introduce the Landscape Model, which describes the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension in a detailed and precise manner. Moreover, this model captures the interpretative processes in which the human mind engages during reading. Within the context of the Landscape Model, we describe the relation between discourse understanding and discourse interpretation, and explain some of the phenomena that are central to the field of discourse analysis as seen from a cognitive perspective. In the first section we describe the basic cognitive processes that underlie discourse understanding, as captured by the Landscape Model. In the following section we illustrate the way that the Landscape Model can be applied to the work of discourse analysts. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the cognitive Landscape Model for the field of discourse analysis.<br>

Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Abstract: In this article, Levinas' ethical metaphysics is analyzed and his contribution to present-day philosophy is described. In his philosophy, ethics is not something that originates in the autonomous will, as Kant would have premised. It is, rather, the result of the traumatic rupturing of the I by the Other, a heteronomous event. The I's passivity in being opened by the Other is highlighted by Levinas in the words "substitution," "obsession," and "being elected." The I, in the critical Others' eyes, is guilty. The infinity in the Other's demand, regarding the I, is divine. It would be a fatal misunderstanding of Levinas to think that, with the insertion of the word "God," he becomes a theologian. In this article the relation between ethics and politics is discussed and their relation to God is pointed to. In this way, Levinas' discourse on God is demonstrated as being fitting for our time, after the crisis of humanism during the Holocaust. In the course of the article, the question of whether there "is" a God in the eyes of Levinas, and if man "needs" Him is answered. In other words, the logical status of the word "God" in Levinas' philosophy is defined.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

poser comme membre de la société ». Fichte devait développer ce thème dans « Du Droit des
gens et du Droit cosmopolite », deuxième annexe au Droit naturel, § 22 : « L'arrivant étranger
dispose du droit humain originaire, qui précède tous les contrats juridiques et seul les rend pos-
sibles : le droit de présupposer pour tous les hommes qu'ils peuvent entrer avec lui par des contrats
dans une relation juridique. Cela seul constitue le véritable droit de l'homme, qui revient à
l'homme en tant qu'homme : la possibilité d'acquérir des droits... C'est dans ce droit de circuler
librement sur le territoire et de s'offrir pour contracter des liens juridiques que consiste le droit
de simple citoyen du monde. »<br>

Abstract: L'objet de ce commentaire d'un texte, qui se trouve dans les dernières pages de la Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli, est de montrer que la relation à la mort, loin d'être directe comme le voudrait Heidegger, est indirecte et passe par des détours. La formule « Vivant jusqu'à la mort » signifie d'abord « vivre jusqu'au bout ». Mais « vivant » ne dit pas seulement le contraire de la mort, ce participe présent renvoyant à une vie « persévérante » qui reconnaît son opposition irréductible à la mort à travers ses épreuves exigeantes et s'approche alors de la réconciliation avec soi.<br>

Derrida relance la discussion grâce à un examen rigoureux de la relation toujours présente entre
conditionnai]'té et inconditionnalité du pardon. Ses principaux textes sur ce sujet sont : « L'ex-

Abstract: Avec la publication des derniers tomes des Lieux de mémoire, notre nouveau « Lavisse », c'est à une interrogation sur les liens de l'histoire et de la mémoire que nous sommes conduits. Le règne de l'historiographie, le succès de l'édition de livres historiques n'indiquent-ils pas que notre relation à l'histoire est en train de changer?<br>

Abstract: Qu'y a-t-il de commun entre les réflexions sur les métamorphoses du travail (Daniel Cohen), la société en réseaux (Manuel Castells), l'évolution des loisirs (Paul Yonnet), le capitalisme financier (André Orléan)... sinon leur affirmation que la condition de la réussite passe par la « chasse au temps mort »? Les révolutions du temps présent invitent donc à considérer que la relation au temps, combat ouvert dès les années 1970, est peut-être la meilleure option à prendre pour résister aux méfaits du capitalisme et, surtout, pour asseoir une culture politique démocratique.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo contém uma leitura em contraponto: a noção de situação em Simone de Beauvoir e a de intersecções em Donna Haraway expressariam supostos relacionais; mulher estaria para Beauvoir como ciborgue está para Haraway; Beauvoir distingue a situação das mulheres, dos judeus e dos negros, considerando a relação entre situações e consciências históricas e|ou biológicas. A biologia aparece em situação como construção mítica de uma identidade a ser ultrapassada para a constituição do sujeito; em Haraway, o ciborgue seria uma narrativa sobre como o biológico e a realidade social de raça e gênero situam-se em uma rede de interações, informação e semiologia. Relação e constituição do "objeto", temas caros à teoria social, seriam instituídos em (e pela) alteridade sem a dicotomia dura entre realidade e ficção, natureza e cultura, literatura e ciência. In this article I will present a counterpoint between notions of 'situation' by Simone de Beauvoir and 'intersections' by Donna Haraway, which express ideas of relation. I will argue that woman for Beauvoir is like cyborg for Haraway. Beauvoir distinguishes the situation of women, Jews and blacks by considering the relationship between situations and historical consciousness and | or biological weapons. For Beauvoir, the biology in situation appears as construction of a mythical identity to be overcome for the formation of the subject. Alternatively, Haraway uses the cyborg as a narrative of how the biological and social reality of race and gender are into a network of interactions, information and semiology. With this claiming for alterity inside the relation and constitution of the "object", both authors bring important challenges to two of the most important issues of social theory. Moreover, they do it without the hard dichotomy between reality and fiction, nature and culture, literature and science.<br>

Article Title: THE RHETORICAL TURN IN ANTHROPOLOGY<br>
Publisher: Etnologický Ústav Akademie ved Ceské Republiky, v. v. i.<br>
Issue: i24330169<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): MOKRZAN MICHAŁ<br>
Abstract: The article discusses the theoretical and methodological considerations as well as the practical application of two incarnations of the rhetorical turn in socio-cultural anthropology. Rhetorical turn is understood as a linguistie and constructivist turn, which marks a substantial part of contemporary thinking in the social sciences and humanities. Reflection about the relation between anthropology and rhetoric shows that the rhetorical turn is oriented on analyzing the rhetoric of anthropological texts, in their persuasive and figurative dimension. On the other hand, rhetorical turn refers to the research perspective in anthropology which is focused on the interpretation of society and culture in which an important role is played by the tools and concepts of rhetoric. Článek je věnován teoretickým a metodologickým úvahám, stejně jako praktické aplikaci dvou aspektů rétorického obratu v sociokulturní antropologii. Spojení „rétorický obrat” je zde použito pro lingvistický a konstruktivistický obrat, který významnou měrou poznamenal současný stav společenských a humanitních věd. Zaměříme-li se na vztah antropologie a rétoriky, zjistíme, že rétorický obrat s sebou přinesl úvahy o rétorice antropologických textů, o jejich přesvědčovacím a obrazném rozměru. Na druhé straně se rétorický obrat vztahuje k výzkumné perspektivě v antropologii, soustředěné na interpretaci společnosti a kultury, v níž hrají významnou roli nástroje a koncepty rétoriky.<br>

Publisher: Éditions OUSIA<br>
Issue: i24353823<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Guéguen Haud<br>
Abstract: Comme le montre l'excellent article de E. Eliasson {art. cit.), il est par
ailleurs très intéressant de noter que, chez les médioplatoniciens, cette reprise
se fera à partir d'une double réception : celle du mythe d'Er, à partir duquel il
s'agit d'articuler les rôles respectifs de l'action humaine (le choix), de l'inter-
vention divine ou du destin (exécution de ce choix) et du tirage au sort
(hasard); et celle de la conception aristotélicienne du έφ' ήμίν, pensé à partir
de DI13 comme non-nécessaire et identifié à l'action humaine, dont la réalisa-
tion et les conséquences sont pour leur part assimilées au destin. Le destin, dès
lors, inclut tout, mais certaines choses à titre d'hypothèses (nos choix et actions
identifiées au έφ' ήμίν) et d'autres à titre de conséquences (leurs effets). Le
έφ ήμίν est donc inclus dans le destin, mais non soumis au destin, ce qui per-
met, comme le note E. Eliasson, d'éviter les « conséquences déterministes de
la théorie stoïcienne ». Sur ce point, voir également S. Bobzien (art. cit.), qui
montre la façon dont, à travers cette reprise, la notion de έφ ήμίν se trouvera
subordonnée au contingent et, plus précisément, à ce qui arrive non pas la plu-
part du temps ou rarement, mais à ce qui arrive « en part égale », que Némésius
(De la nature de l'homme, 104. 6.7; 114.21.2), comme Plutarque (Du destin,
571 c-d), identifient à ce que nous sommes capables de faire et son opposé.
Dans cette tradition, elle montre donc que le concept de έφ' ήμίν se trouve
pensé à partir de trois sources aristotéliciennes : la question du délibérable
(EN III 4); le concept de possibilité double en sa relation à la puissance
rationnelle (DI 13; Mét. Θ); et le problème des futurs contingents (DI 9).<br>

Abstract: Concerning the modern discussion about the relation between event and narration and "Time and Narration" (Paul Ricœur) the author asks about the relation between entanglement and narration in Wilhelm Schapps philosophy of stories. The philosophy of stories does not approve a systematisation of the topic but does allow its discussion under various aspects. Among those, the author chooses the existence of narrations in the stories of the entangled, the silent speaking, the entanglement in a positive world and the relation between the story of one's life and poetry. The essay also is a contribution to basic questions of narrative ethics.<br>

Author(s): Siegfried Meike<br>
Abstract: This essay discusses Heidegger's interpretation of autobiographical narration in his lecture on Basic Problems of Phenomenology (WS 1919/20) as an alternative conception of authenticity. A focused comparison between Heidegger's early understanding of the 'narrated self' and the analysis of the call of conscience in Being and Time shows that the most problematic aspects of Heidegger's later idea of authenticity result from a distinct isolation of the authentic self, which is specific for his conception of authenticity since the mid-twenties. At last, the article intends to demonstrate that Heidegger's early idea of an original self-understanding is close to current philosophical theories which assume a holistic idea of authenticity and point out a strong relation between authenticity and narrativity.<br>

Publisher: FELIX MEINER VERLAG<br>
Issue: i24358654<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Amthor David<br>
Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas' earliest development of thought is presented here as a phenomenological endeavor, i.e. in its relation to Husserl and Heidegger as well as in its own effort to give an appropriate philosophical account of ‚things themselves‘. The latter task is shown to have a transcendental dimension as it is a self-awareness of conscious life in which the faithful analysis of concrete phenomena and the concept of this life itself have to be brought into attunement. The perspective of Levinas' phenomenological gaze is then presented in these terms and shows two fairly distinct stages. Up to the mid-1930s Levinas appears as a follower of Martin Heidegger, when he advocates an appropriate approach to being in all its richness and therefore criticizes Husserl's alleged intellectualism. Later, with a radicalized perspective, Levinas' own philosophical project advocates an appropriate account of the problem of radical alterity beyond experience and phenomenology. He therefore criticizes both Husserl and Heidegger and remodels phenomenology so that it can adequately ‚understand‘ radical alterity and at the same time confine itself before it.<br>

Author(s): Bonnemann Jens<br>
Abstract: In ethics, when discussing problems of justice and a just social existence one question arises obviously: What is the normal case of the relation between I and you we start from? In moral philosophy, each position includes basic socio–anthropological convictions in that we understand the other, for example, primarily as competitor in the fight for essential resources or as a partner in communication. Thus, it is not the human being as isolated individual, or as specimen of the human species or socialised member of a historical society what needs to be understood. Instead, the individual in its relation to the other or others has been studied in phenomenology and the philosophy of dialogue of the twentieth century. In the following essay I focus on Martin Buber's and Jean–Paul Sartre's theories of intersubjectivity which I use in order to explore the meaning of recognition and disrespect for an individual. They offer a valuable contribution to questions of practical philosophy and the socio–philosophical diagnosis of our time.<br>

Abstract: Moritz DrobiscH: Uber den neuesten Versuch die Psychologie naturwissenschaftlich zu be-
gründen. In: Zeitschrift für exacte Philosophie 4 (1864), S. 313-348, vermutete, daß WUNDT das
Theorem von Helmholtz übernommen hat (s. S. 334 f). In seiner Rezension des Helmholtz-
schen Handbuchs distanziert sich WuNDT allerdings von Helmholtz' Begriff des „Analogie-
schlusses". Dieser sei nicht geeignet, die originäre Bildung der ersten Wahrnehmungen etwa der
„Abmessungen meines Sehfeldes" zu erklären. Vgl.: Deutsche Klinik 19 (1867), S. 326. Später,
nachdem er selbst die Gültigkeit des Theorems bereits stark eingeschränkt hatte, reklamiert
WUNDT für sich eine von Helmholtz unabhängige Formulierung des Theorems, billigt anderer-
seits aber auch Helmholtz eine nach Berkeleys und Schopenhauers Vorgang originale Lei-
stung zu. Vgl. seine Berichtigende Bemerkung zu dem Aufsatze des Herrn B. Erdmann, fZur zeit-
genössischen Psychologie in Deutschland'. In: Vierteljahresschrift für wissenschaftliche Philoso-
phie 4 (1880), S. 137 f. Als Assistent von Helmholtz (seit 1858) hätte Wundt freilich sehr wohl
Kenntnis von Helmholtz' Königsberger Vorträgen (s. o. Anm. 47) haben können, in denen das
Theorem zwar noch nicht (wie dann im Handbuch) expressis verbis, wohl aber seiner Grund-
struktur nach auftaucht. Solomon Diamond: Wundt before Leipzig. In: Robert W. Rieber
(ed.): Wilhelm Wundt and the Making of a Scientific Psychology. New York 1980, S. 32, kom-
mentiert: Daß Wundt in seiner Entgegnung auf Erdmann eine von Helmholtz unabhängige
Formulierung des Theorems für sich reklamiert, „does not explain how he could have remained
ignorant of it for so long afterward. Even if an honest mistake, Wundt's initial use of the concept
without acknowledging Helmholtz' priority certainly cast a shadow across their relationship." Zu
Recht relativiert Richards diese Prioritätsstreitigkeiten unter Hinweis darauf, daß die Annahme

Abstract: In this article I analyze verbally portrayed experiences of 27 survivors from the 1990s' war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One aim of the article is to analyze markers for reconciliation and implacability, the second is to describe the terms for reconciliation which are actualized in those stories. The interactive dynamics, which occurred during the war, make the post-war reconciliation wartime associated. Narratives about reconciliation, implacability and terms for reconciliation, are not only formed in relation to the war as a whole but also in relation to one's own and others' wartime actions. The narratives about reconciliation become an arena in which we and them are played against each other in different ways – not least by rejecting the others' acts during the war. In the interviewees stories implacability is predominant but reconciliation is presented as a possibility if certain conditions are met. These conditions are, for instance, justice for war victims, perpetrators' recognition of crime and perpetrators' emotional commitment (for example the display of remorse and shame).<br>

Issue: i24395981<br>

Author(s): Knight Christopher J.<br>
Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Abstract: Dans son ouvrage, Judith Butler (2002 : 136-37) souligne l'ambivalence des
processus d'assujettissement. En se référant plus particulièrement à Surveiller et
punir. Naissance de la prison de Foucault (1975), et en rétablissant la notion
de « sujet » comme effet et produit de l'assujettissement, elle écrit : « Foucault
suggère que le prisonnier n'est pas régulé par une relation extérieure au pouvoir,
du type de celle par laquelle une institution prend un individu donné pour cible
de ses objectifs de subordination. Au contraire, l'individu est formé ou plutôt
formulé à travers son "identité" de prisonnier de manière discursive. L'assujettis-
sement est littéralement la fabrication d'un sujet, le principe de régulation à tra-
vers lequel un sujet est formulé ou produit. Pareil assujettissement est un type
de pouvoir qui ne se contente pas d'agir unilatéralement, en tant que forme de
domination sur un individu donné, mais qui de plus active ou forme le sujet.
Ainsi l'assujettissement n'est ni simplement la domination ni la production d'un

Abstract: Pour Louis Dumont, la hiérarchie d'une société serait en fait définie par une valeur, ou une « idéologie », qui
engloberait toutes les autres valeurs, selon le principe de 1'« englobement du contraire ». Chaque élément d'une
société ferait partie de l'ensemble, lui serait consubstantiel ou identique, mais en même temps parviendrait à
s'en distinguer ou à s'y opposer. Louis Dumont, Homo hierarchicus : le système des castes et ses implications, Paris,
Gallimard, 1979, postface; Michael Houseman, « La relation hiérarchique : idéologie particulière ou modèle
général? », dans Jean-Claude Galey (dir.), Différences, valeurs, hiérarchie : textes offerts à Louis Dumont, Paris,
EHESS, 1984, p. 299-318. On peut trouver un bon exemple empirique de cette théorie dans la description que
fait Bourdieu du « monde à l'envers » de la maison kabyle : sitôt le seuil franchi, l'espace se retourne, les orients
s'échangent et l'on passe d'un monde à un autre, les valeurs viriles et masculines qui étaient dominantes à
l'extérieur se soumettant à la domination féminine de l'espace intérieur. Pierre Bourdieu, Le sens pratique, Paris,

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>

Abstract: This article is a wide-ranging consideration of the role that contemporary academic psychology might play in the study of the Bible. I begin by examining the historical reasons for suspicion of psychology within the community of biblical scholarship, focusing on several perennial objections. Having addressed these objections, I go on to set out a framework for the legitimate use of psychology in enhancing understanding of the process of production and reception of the biblical texts, and of elucidating their meaning. Finally, I suggest that some contemporary methodological quality-control systems from psychology might inform the question of what constitutes a good reading of a particular text. I explore this issue further by using the example of trauma processing in relation to the New Testament, suggesting that if the text is to be received as transformative, a good reading is likely to be dissonant, challenging, or ugly.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

Abstract: Faire l'histoire des sciences sociales après 1945, dans un contexte de circulation transnationale croissante des savoirs, pousse le chercheur à s'intéresser à la dimension internationale des carrières scientifiques. Dans le cas de Michel Crozier, un des leaders de la sociologie française après 1960, ses relations avec les États-Unis furent capitales pour expliquer la réussite de sa carrière. Ressources scientifiques, appuis académiques, inspiration intellectuelle plus générale, les États-Unis lui furent un remarquable tremplin. Mais, dans cette vie entre deux pays, la pensée de Crozier fut finalement celle de la distance critique, aussi bien vis-à-vis de la France que des États-Unis. Cela explique peut-être, in fine, sa relative perte de notoriété dans ces deux pays. Outlining the history of the social sciences after 1945, in the context of the increasingly transnational circulation of knowledge, obliges us to contemplate the international dimension of scientific careers. For Michel Crozier – one of the leading French social scientists post-1960 – his relation to the United States was crucial for the success of his career. Providing scientific opportunities, academic support and general intellectual inspiration, the United States were to him an amazing springboard. Nevertheless, as a consequence splitting his time between these two countries, Crozier's thought became the expression of critical distance towards both France and the United States. Ultimately, this perhaps explains his relative lack of fame on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>

Abstract: Cécile et Étienne sont amants. Elle est âgée de trente-six ans, mariée et mère, vit à Paris; il a dix ans de moins, est célibataire, provincial et sans expérience sexuelle. Leur importante correspondance a été déposée à l'Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA) et constitue une source d'une grande richesse. Faisant appel à la microhistoire et attentive à l'analyse des discours, nous proposons de suivre le développement de l'histoire d'amour de Cécile et Étienne entre 1945 et 1960, en s'attardant sur ses prémices entre 1945 et 1949. L'analyse d'une relation adultère vécue de l'intérieur permet de mieux comprendre les métamorphoses de l'intimité au cours de cette période du baby-boom, en particulier les rôles masculin et féminin. Cette histoire singulière permet aussi d'éclairer, par un jeu de contrastes, les représentations de la conjugalité pendant les décennies d'après-guerre — période de doutes au sujet de l'intimité. En quoi ce couple adultère interroge-t-il et contourne-t-il les normes conjugales, tout en cherchant à s'y conformer? Cécile and Étienne were lovers. She was a thirty-six year-old mother, married and living in Paris; he was ten years younger, single, living in the suburbs and lacking in sexual experience. Their vast correspondence, deposited with the Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA, Association for Autobiography and Autobiographical Heritage), constitutes a documentary source of great value. Referencing the phenomenon of microhistory and relying upon discourse analysis, we shall attempt to follow the trajectory of Cécile and Étienne's relationship between 1945 and 1960, focusing in particular on its beginnings from 1945 to 1949. Analysing an adulterous relationship from such an inside perspective will shed light on the metamorphosis of intimacy that occurred during the Baby Boom era, in particular with regard to male and female gender roles. By playing with contrasts, this uni~<br>

Abstract: Les liens entre anthropologie et histoire, qui ont été très forts depuis les années 1960, semblent parfois se distendre depuis deux décennies. À partir d'un point de vue localisé, celui d'un historien des derniers siècles du Moyen Âge, cet article cherche à s'interroger sur la réalité actuelle des formes d'échange scientifique entre les deux disciplines. Tout en rappelant l'importance de l'anthropologie historique et des objets de recherche partagés par les historiens et les anthropologues, il cherche à mettre en évidence une autre perspective de travail, en montrant comment les interrogations des anthropologues sur l'historicité, sur la forme et le statut de l'information recueillie durant leur travail de terrain, ou sur leur propre engagement subjectif par rapport à ce terrain, offrent aux historiens, qui sont confrontés à des questionnements parallèles, des ressources nouvelles pour prolonger la fécondité des échanges interdisciplinaires. The links between anthropology and history have been very tight since the 1960s but seem to have loosened during the past two decades. From a very « localized » viewpoint as a historian of the latter part of the Middle Ages, questions are raised about the current reality of forms of scientific exchanges between these two disciplines. While recalling the importance of historical anthropology and of subjects of research shared by historians and anthropologists, another perspective of work is opened by showing how anthropologists' interrogations about historicity, the form and status of the information gathered during fieldwork, or about their own subjective commitments in relation to the field, provide historians, who face parallel interrogations, with new resources for fertilizing multidisciplinary exchanges.<br>

Abstract: See for instance Lire le Capital, I, pp. 47f, 169f. See also MansChot, op. cit.,
pp. IV—17, IV—21f. 'Not in the superstructure' does not mean here simply 'then
it is in the basis'. The 'problem' is that scientific thought, as thought, cannot be
put in the same category as material powers of production; cf. Lire le Capital,
p. 47 : 'Ce système de production théorique, système matériel autant que "spiri-
tuel"...'. Manschot admits 'that Althusser has not yet been able to develop a new
formulation of the problem of the relation science-society. Strictly speaking, he has
not got further than the assertion that the old notions of this relationship are no
longer tenable'. (IV—22).<br>

Hommes, in contrast, arrives at a complete rejection of 'such external points of contact

and hence reveal the need for 'an inner point of connection resident in the nature of scientific

Abstract: The transcendental critique of theoretical thought as it was developed by Herman
Dooyeweerd can be seen as a particularization of a général reflective critique of experience.
This perspective implies that theoretical thought and everyday experience do not stand
opposite each other as 'Gegenstand-relation' versus 'subject-object relation', as in
Dooyeweerd. I hope to show elsewhere the structural affinity of these two.<br>

Abstract: Other thinkers have also been instrumental in re-inteφreting philosophy as a way of re-
storing contact. I am thinking of Spren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas,
Paul Ricoeur, Charles Taylor and Alasdair Maclntyre - Spren Kierkegaard (1844, 1845, 1848)
with his analysis of human freedom as entangled in itself and liberated by the 'jump' into faith;
Heidegger (1927) with his analysis of anxiety as openness for the possibility of one's (own) im-
possibility; Levinas (1974) with his notion of the Other as a disquieting openness or wound in
my existence, Ricoeur (1990) with his four-fold analysis of the self as a relatedness to oneself
opened-up by the presence of the other, Taylor (1989) with his notion of disengaged reason
and of the intrinsic relation of persons to (their) 'goods', Maclntyre (1981) with his concept of
'goods' internai to practices.<br>

Abstract: In the pertinent passage Dooyeweerd's view of the I as a transcendental concentration
point is contrasted with Kierkegaard's comment on the I (or self). Kierkegaard calls the self "a
relation which relates to itself, and in relating to itself relates to something else." This 'some-
thing else' is a power, namely: God. See Kierkegaard (1849, 43) and Glas (1995a, 74-76).<br>

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Author(s): Blond Louis<br>
Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i342774<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Woolfolk Craig J.<br>
Abstract: This article explores the meanings that consumption experiences hold for professional working mothers engaged in the culturally prominent lifestyle known as "juggling." A discussion is given to prior research documenting the cultural and historical processes that gave rise to this lifestyle pattern. These analyses suggest that "jugglers" of the baby boom generation have been socialized in a common system of conflicting cultural ideals, beliefs, and gender ideologies. A hermeneutic research approach is used to explicate the emic consumer meanings that arise in relation to the participants' salient life concerns and their sense of personal history. An etic framework is then derived that further analyzes these perceptions in the context of issues related to the social construction of feminine identities and cultural conceptions of motherhood. The conceptual and methodological implications of the emic and etic frameworks for consumer research are discussed.<br>

Author(s): Morris Rosalind C.<br>
Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

À la faveur du regard critique que l'anthropologie porte désormais sur ses propres procédures, il s'agit de s'interroger sur le rôle joué par catégories semi-empiriques, tournures rhétoriques et postures énonciatives dans des mises en discours dépendant du triangle sémiotique. /// The epistemological foundations of cultural and social anthropology - a relation established between a set of native cultural phenomena and our own academic culture - can be seen in terms of translation. Owing to the critical inquiry that anthropology now makes into its own procedures, questions can be raised about the role played by semi-empirical categories, rhetorical phrases and enunciative stances in the formulation of discourses depending on the semiotic triangle.<br>

Abstract: Nous avons tenté de montrer que les recherches longtemps réunies sous le nom de biologie de l'art ont constitué les racines oubliées de la pensée anthropologique d'Aby Warburg. Connues par lui en 1895-1896, ces perspectives nourrissent encore en 1927, à la fin de sa vie, sa réflexion. À partir de l'analyse ethnographique de la représentation des noms propres dans le Sepik, nous avons ensuite montré que, pour tenter de déchiffrer l'utopie dont témoigne sa pensée - formuler une anthropologie de la mémoire sociale telle qu'elle se fonde sur les traditions iconographiques -, il est nécessaire de reprendre, d'un point de vue critique, la méthode morphologique de la biologie de l'art, et sa manière de reconstruire les opérations mentales impliquées par le déchiffrement des images. /// The studies that have, for a long time now, been assembled under the name " Biology of Art " form the forgotten roots of Aby Warburg's approach to anthropology. He learned about them in 1895-1896, and the thus opened perspectives were still enriching his thinking at the end of his life in 1927. An analysis of conceptions about proper names in the Sepik area is used to show that, to decipher the utopia in Warburg's thinking - formulate an anthropology of social memory in relation to iconographic traditions - it is necessary to critically examine the morphological method of the biology of art and its way of reconstructing the mental operations involved in deciphering images.<br>

Article Title: In Search of a Postcolonial Theory of Normative Integration: Reflections on A.C. Cairns' Theory of "Citizens Plus"<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i25165879<br>
Date: 12 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Libesman Heidi<br>
Abstract: The focus of this article is the theory of integration advanced by Alan Cairns in his book, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian State". Cairns' theory has had a mixed reception since its publication. Like much scholarship and public policy in the Aboriginal rights field, "Citizens Plus" has attracted strong proponents and opponents. At present "Citizens Plus" remains one of the primary competitors vying for influence in guiding the postcolonial reconfiguration of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian state and civil society on terms of justice that may be perceived as legitimate by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. The prime alternative, as conceived by both Cairns and his critics, is the nation-to-nation constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The author provides a political theoretical reading of "Citizens Plus". She seeks to disclose the normative and conceptual structure of Cairns' argument and to situate Cairns' theory in the context of debates concerning the future of Aboriginal peoples and the constitution of Canada. This reading foregrounds an alternative interpretation of the relationship between "Citizens Plus" and the constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which makes it possible to see them as complementary rather than opposed constitutional visions. The author also raises broader questions concerning the reasons for continuing the search, at the heart of Cairns' work, for a post-colonial theory and praxis of normative integration in diverse societies, and the conditions of the possibility of such a theory and praxis. Ultimately the author argues that whether one agrees or disagrees with Cairns' prescription, at a minimum "Citizens Plus" should be understood as raising a fundamental question to which multinational constitutional theory must respond. /// Le présent article a pour objet d'examiner la théorie avancée par Alan Cairns dans son ouvrage, "Ci~<br>

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Article Title: Mathematics and Mathematics Education as Triadic Communication? A Semiotic Framework Exemplified<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i25472056<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ongstad Sigmund<br>
Abstract: The article investigates in the first part critically dyadic and essentialist understanding of signs and utterances in mathematics and mathematics education as opposed to a triadic view. However even Peircean semiotics, giving priority to triadic, dynamic sign may face challenges, such as explaining the sign as a pragmatic act and how signs are related to context. To meet these and other hurdles an explicit communicational, pragmatic and triadic view, found in parts of the works of Bühler, Bakhtin, Habermas, and Halliday, is developed. Two basic principles are combined and established in a theoretical framework. Firstly, whenever uttering, there will exist in any semiotic sign system, dynamic reciprocity and simultaneity between expressing through form, referring to content, and addressing as an act. Secondly, meaning will be created by the dynamics between given and new in utterances and between utterances and contextual genres. The latter principle explains how meaning merge in communication dynamically and create the basis for a discursive understanding of semiosis and hence even learning at large. The second part exemplifies each of the three main aspects and the dynamics of utterance and genre and given and new by excerpts from a textbook in mathematics education. The concept 'positioning', in use for operationalisation, is explained in relation to main principles of the framework. The article ends focusing crucial implications for validation when moving from a dyadic to a triadic understanding of mathematics and mathematics education.<br>

Author(s): Elfenbein Andrew<br>
Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i25501821<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Emery Jacob<br>
Abstract: Andrey Bely's novel "Petersburg" (one of the high points of Russian literary modernism and a rough analogue to James Joyce's Ulysses) repeatedly claims that parent and child, being of the same flesh and blood, share an ambivalent identity. At the same time, because the novel opens by invoking a major character's genealogical relation to Adam, the book implies that this kin identity is universal and can be applied to the entire human race. This essay analyzes the role of kinship metaphor in "Petersburg", demonstrating that tropes of parent-child identity facilitate the novel's dizzying metaphoric conflation, that they form a kind of metafictional mirror in which the novel probes its own nature as a work of the imagination, and that Bely's theory and practice of metaphor touch on broader philosophical issues of figure and fictionality.<br>

Abstract: Regido por la subjetividad, el universo contemporáneo del creer es en todas sus partes de circulación fluida, inmediatamente refractario a cualquier referencia estructurante a estabilidad alguna, excepto cuando postula esta estabilidad como puramente operatoria. El objetivo del creer contemporáneo no consiste en alcanzar una "identidad religiosa" (que se concibe como "estable"), sino demostrar que puede ser un creer dentro del movimiento. En realidad, el concepto de "religión", como también los de "secularización" y de "laicidad" que se le asocian, pasan a ser, en situación de plena legitimidad social de la individualización radical de la construcción de una relación con el sentido, conceptos cada vez más indeterminados y en consecuencia de sobra inutilizables, al menos mientras se persista en reconocerles una pertinencia que les sería propia. La "religión", por ello, no es sino el indicador de recomposiciones más amplias, en las cuales participa, por otra parte, como instrumento de gestión. Así, sólo tiene sentido como objeto de intermediación, un analizador que, contextualizado, puede por lo demás resultar muy precioso. /// Ruled by subjectivity, the contemporary universe of belief is in all its parts of fluid circulation, immediately impervious to any structuring reference to any stability, unless this stability is posited as a purely operating principle. The aim of contemporary belief is not to achieve a "religious identity" (which would be conceived as "stable"), but to show that it can be a belief within movement. In fact, the concept of "religion", as well as the related concepts of "secularization" and "laicism" that are associated to it, happen to become, in a situation of total social legitimacy of radical individualization in constructing a relation with meaning, increasingly indeterminate and consequently utterly useless concepts, at least as far as there persists the will to grant them a pertinence of their own.

Author(s): Tuan Yi-Fu<br>
Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Abstract: Social scientists who study peasant groups in Brazil have come across some unfamiliar expressions. In searching for an explanatory analogical key which would make a translation possible, economic and political referents have commonly been used. The author argues that one must take seriously the existence of a 'biblical culture' that cannot be simply reduced to other codes. This is illustrated by the notion of captivity which has usually been taken as refering to authoritarianism, capitalism, expropriation, proletarianization, etc. The author suggests that although contextually all this may be true, the main reference has to do with what Paul Ricoeur has termed the symbolism of evil. Empirical material drawn from his own and other social scientists' researches in the Amazon is used to illustrate this possibility, which seems to bear significant theoretical and political consequences. Symbolism, the notion of text as regards the relation between cultural phenomenon and social conditions, the relation between autonomy and dependence, different notions of time and history are some of the themes that come up either as new perspectives regarding old issues or as subproducts of this line of reasoning. Los científicos sociales que estudian grupos campesinos en Brasil han descubierto expresiones poco usuales para ellos. Buscando una clave explicativa analógica que hiciera posible una traducción, se han usado generalmente ciertos referentes de naturaleza económica y política. El autor argumenta que es necesario tomar en serio la existencia de una 'cultura bíblica,' que no puede ser simplemente reducida a otro código. Eso se ilustra con la noción de cautiverio, que normalmente se entiende como referencia al autoritarismo, al capitalismo, a la expropiación, a la proletarización, etc. El autor sugiere que, aunque todo eso pueda ser verdad contextualmente, la referencia principal tiene que ver con lo que Paul Ricoeur denominara simbolismo del mal, lo que a su vez se articula con ~<br>

Abstract: Le Mangeur (2006) est un roman qui intrigue: celle qui y dit "je" est un être de dualité, pris entre rêve et réalité, et s'exprime dans un langage de l'obliquité, fondé sur une symbolique diététique et cannibalesque qui appelle à interprétation. Le texte invite, d'une part, à une lecture psychanalytique qui toutefois ne le saisit pas entièrement. D'autre part, il laisse deviner un imaginaire chinois, à peine discernable et comme en partie métamorphosé. Il s'agit ici de poursuivre et faire dialoguer ces deux lectures, en s'appuyant pour l'une sur les concepts d'introjection et d'incorporation développés par Nicolas Abraham et Maria Torok, et pour l'autre sur l'œuvre du sinologue et philosophe François Jullien. Mises en relation, ces deux approches révèlent un sujet à la croisée de deux imaginaires, en lutte contre deux variantes de l'autorité patriarcale. Le texte apparaît alors comme une forme de renouvellement de l'écriture puisant largement dans la tradition chinoise.<br>

Abstract: Heidegger's characterization of Dasein as Being-in-the-world suggests a natural relation to environmental philosophy. Among environmentalists, however, closer inspection must raise alarm, both since Heidegger's approach is in some senses inescapably anthropocentric and since Dasein discovers its environment through its usability, serviceability, and accessibility. Yet Heidegger does not simply adopt a traditionally modern, instrumental view. The conditions under which the environment appears imply neither that the environment consists only of tools, nor that what is true of the parts is also true of the whole, nor that an orientation to use—where appropriate—precludes any other orientation. Heidegger's anthropocentric commitments thus do not rule out the possibility of a non-instrumental perspective on the natural world.<br>

Abstract: Sur la question de la bienfaisance, Buridan est débiteur du traité De Bentficiis de
Sénèque qui envisage longuement les critères de la bonté et de la générosité sociales dans
l'intérêt public. Voir à ce sujet, les précisions de P. HADOT, La citadelle intérieure. Intro-
duction aux Pensées de Marc Aurèle, Paris, rééd. 1997, p. 216: «La philosophie antique
avait, depuis longtemps, réfléchi sur la manière de faire du bien à autri, et tout spéciale-
ment sur le problème psychologiue que pose la relation entre le bienfaiteur et son obligé.
[...] Pour les Stoïciens, la bienfaisance faisait partie des 'devoirs', des 'actions appropriées'
à notre nature humaine. Sénèque, utilisant un ouvrage du stoïcien Hécaton, avait com-
posé un traité Des Bienfaits où il affirmait notamment à plusieurs reprises que le bienfai-
teur ne devait pas considérer celui qui recevait le bienfait comme son débiteur». Voir éga-

Abstract: This paper deals with the manner of negotiating the relation to its colonial past of France in the Maghreb, concentrating on a key episode in the national historical account, the battle held to have taken place at Poitiers in 732. The creation, near Châtellerault, of a memorial site for that battle, and the annual commemoration which takes place there, constitute the substance of this paper, unfolding in three phases: firstly, an archeology of the genesis of the “Site of 732” situated in the context of the years from 1960 to 1970; secondly, an analysis of the contents of the site as seen through the typology of the discourses constructing the museum project; finally, clearly setting out the social issues involved in memorialisation, through observation and using the survey carried out on visitors to the site.<br>

Abstract: Dans le cadre du séminaire Bonheur et Travail qui a débouché sur une enquête de l'Insee, Céline Bessière et Frédérique Houseaux ont pu « suivre des enquêteurs » et tirer de leurs observations de terrain quelques conclusions sur la production de données statistiques. Une passation mouvementée du questionnaire auprès d'un salariéagricole agricole montre l'importance de la situation d'enquête ainsi que celle des malentendus sur les mots utilisés. Les auteurs proposent de s'appuyer sur ces «ratés» de la relation d'enquête pour mettre en lumière le rôle souvent oublié de l'enquêteur. Elles suggèrent enfin de rapprocher enquêteurs et concepteurs et d'utiliser les données produites en gardant à l'esprit le travail de traduction qui a présidé à leur fabrication. Christian Baudelot et Michel Gollac en tirent la conclusion qu'il faut «faire avec» et refusent de renoncer aux gains de connaissance qu'apportent les enquêtes statistiques. Ils plaident qu'à condition de ne pas s'y enfermer, on peut les utiliser pour combattre l'ethnocentrisme même qui a pu présider à leur recueil. Florence Weber s'interroge sur la nature de l'interaction entre enquêteur Insee et enquêté: «relation anonyme et formulaire d'enquête» se conjuguent pour la rapprocher des relations qu'entretiennent d'autres agents subalternes de l'État avec les administrés. En jouant sur la nature des questions posées, on déplace simplement le lieu où se produisent les malentendus, à la fois instructifs et constructifs. Enfin, Alain Desrosières se demande «à quoi sert une enquête». Si les mêmes critiques, formulées depuis des décennies, n'ont jamais fait obstacle à la répétition des enquêtes statistiques, c'est que leur enjeu n'est pas seulement cognitif mais aussi politique. Il faut donc restituer la visée d'usage des enquêtes et les moyens sociaux des produits et des énoncés statistiques. Within the scope of the Happiness and Work seminar that led to an Insee survey, Céline Bessière and Frédérique Houseaux were able t~<br>

Abstract: Si le débat qu'a suscité l'esthétique de la réception au sein des disciplines littéraires, s'est cantonné, à de rares exceptions près, au domaine des concepts et des esquisses théoriques, la nouvelle histoire sociale de la lecture a entrepris de rendre raison des variations des appropriations d'un même texte ou d'un même ensemble de textes d'un pôle à l'autre de l'espace social, d'une époque à une autre ou encore d'une société à l'autre. Quant aux résultats des enquêtes accumulées depuis le début des années soixante-dix, l'hypothèse d'une triple homologie entre division du travail – entre «monde des choses matérielles» et «monde des choses humaines» – division scolaire – entre filières scientifiques et filières littéraires – et division entre les sexes, permet de rendre compte des exceptions apparentes à la relation très étroite qui unit les pratiques de lecture et le capital culturel détenu. While the debate generated within literary disciplines concerning the aesthetics of reception has, with few exceptions, been confined to domain of concepts and theoretical outlines, the new social history of reading has attempted to account for the varied ways in which a single text or even a group of texts is appropriated from one end of society to the other of society, from one historical period to another or from one society to the next. As for the results of surveys accumulated since the early 1970s, the hypothesis of a threefold equivalence of the division of labour – between a "world of material things" and a "world of human things" – the academic division between scientific and literary paths – and division of the sexes, accounts for the apparent exceptions to the very close relationship linking reading practices and the possession of cultural assets.<br>

Author(s): Swaine Lucas A.<br>
Abstract: Mark Waddicor notices that this is one of the disadvantages of using letters in the
way that Montesquieu does; it gives the work an impression of incoherence. See Mark H.
Waddicor, Montesquieu: Lettres persanes (London, 1977), p. 12. Pauline Kra argues that
there are six distinct themes in the Persian Letters, arranged in discrete sequences, and
that this is the secret chain. See P. Kra, 'The Invisible Chain of the Lettres persanes',
Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, XXXIII (1963), pp. 7-60, p. 53. That
some letters focus more upon one topic than another is scarcely a secret, however, and it
would hardly be worth keeping if it were. Furthermore, some themes, such as that of
justice and its relation to self-interest, span the letters without regard for Kra's
classification.<br>

Abstract: Freud, 'The Uncanny', XVII, p. 220. There is, of course, a vast literature on Freud' s
concept of the uncanny, most of which is not concerned with the self-civilization relation
that is explored in this essay. Julia Kristeva, for example, examines the uncanny in the
context of the self-other relation. 'The uncanny strangeness', she writes, 'allows for
many variations: They all repeat the difficulty I have in situating myself with respect to
the other.' See Julia Kristeva, Strangers to Ourselves, trans. Leon S. Roudiez (New York,
1991), p. 187. While Kristeva's interpretation underscores the place of the uncanny in
human intercourse, Samuel Weber finds the uncanny important in forming a correct
theory of knowledge, one that does not hold to the Cartesian illusion of an objectivizing,
insulated and reliable cognition. 'Whereas for Descartes the essential condition for
attaining certitude was the subject's withdrawal from a world that in its alterity could no
longer be relied on, it is precisely the discovery that such withdrawal is a fata morgana,
an unsustainable construct that informs the misrecognition, that constitutes the uncanny. '
See Samuel Weber, The Legend of Freud (Stanford, CA, 2000), p. 20. For a political
interpretation of the concept, see Derrida's brief but illuminating discussion of the
uncanny element in Marxism, in Jacques Derrida, Specters of Marx (New York, 1994),
pp. 172-5. For a general discussion of Freud's theory of memory, see Richard Terdiman,
Present Past: Modernity and the Memory Crisis (Ithaca, NY, 1993).<br>

Abstract: Through the experience of some ethnographic fields between France and Italy, Tuscany and the Alps, this paper reflects upon the potential of oral history and biography both as cognitive sources and as heritage assets contributing to the processes of improving the cultural values. In particular, we try to clarify the relationship between regional research projects, exhibitions and archiving processes of the sources of ethnographic research. This in relation to the development of new technologies including the web and to the social and cognitive potential use of oral sources in the capitalization and sharing of research materials with cultural communities and within their possible uses for the scientific community. What can become an anthropological interview once recorded, stored and catalogued? What is the potential of these audio recordings and their written versions within projects of participatory museography? How can the web offer new opportunities to those sources by including them in a global system of dialogue between archives? This view changes the responsibilities and possibilities of the researcher producer of sources and collector of voices, engaging him in a quite different consideration of his work to the benefit of societal projects.<br>

parative religion given by Kishimoto at Tôkyô Senmon Gakkô (present-day Waseda
University) were first gathered in 1895 in a volume entitled Tôkyô Senmon Gakkô hôgo bun-
gaku dai ikkai daininenkyil kôgiroku東京専門学校邦語文学第一回第二年級講義録，then
reprinted in 1902 under the new title Hikaku shukyô ippan 比較宗教一斑.Murakami certainly
read these theories in one of the articles published by Kishimoto in the periodicals Rikugô
zasshi and Shûkyô. Murakami, himself, published two of his lectures in Rikugô zasshi: Bukkyô

Abstract: This theme issue's call for papers notes that "several prevalent and influential historical practices of the last thirty years have limited agency's significance,.. seeing the human as the patient of History rather than its agent." The questions implicit in this statement are nowhere more urgent than in those practices collectively known as the "linguistic turn." Yet such questions have been explored sparsely enough in relation to this movement that some adherents can still insist that the ideas they favor do not devalue agency, while many simply ignore the issue and incorporate agency as an integral part of their work. By examining a largely unremarked episode in Michel Foucault's highly influential thought and considering its connections to foundational assumptions of the linguistic turn, we seek to demonstrate in detail why the premises that underlie both structuralism and poststructuralism (the theoretical movements most deeply implicated in the direction the linguistic turn has taken in history) logically require the denial of agency as a causal force and ultimately compel the conclusion that no change can occur in realities as interpreted by humans. We illustrate the intractability of these logical problems by analyzing unsatisfactory defenses from some of the few linguistic-turn historians who have discussed relevant issues, after which we conclude by suggesting that attention to current work in linguistics and cognitive science may help resolve such difficulties.<br>

Abstract: This essay begins by situating the work of David Carr in relation to the reception of phenomenology in the United States. It addresses Carr's early (and continuing) contributions to the philosophy of history, especially as this topic emerges in Husserl's middle and later writings. The idea of point of view as this emerges in Carr's own writings on history is examined, with special attention to differences between its spatial and temporal instantiations. Carr's emphasis on the primacy of temporality in human experience is contrasted with an approach that is more appreciative of the role of place in this experience. It is suggested that place offers an important alternative to time as a basis for the understanding of history and narrative.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27643303<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Jackson Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper charts a policy shift within international and European inter-governmental institutions towards advocating the study of religions (or the study of religions and beliefs) in European publicly funded schools. The events of September 11, 2001 in the USA acted as a "wake up call" in relation to recognising the legitimacy and importance of the study of religions in public education. For example, policy recommendations from the Council of Europe and guiding principles for the study of religions and beliefs from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe have been developed and are under consideration by member or participating states of both bodies. In translating policy into practice, appropriate pedagogies need to be adopted or developed. The paper uses the example of the interpretive approach to indicate how issues of representation, interpretation and reflexivity might be addressed in studying religious diversity within contemporary societies in ways which both avoid stereotyping and engage students' interest.<br>

Abstract: I begin with the assumption that a philosophically significant tension exists today in feminist philosophy of religion between those subjects who seek to become divine and those who seek their identity in mutual recognition. My critical engagement with the ambiguous assertions of Luce Irigaray seeks to demonstrate, on the one hand, that a woman needs to recognize her own identity but, on the other hand, that each subject whether male or female must struggle in relation to the other in order to maintain realism about life and death. No one can avoid the recognition that we are each given life but each of us also dies. In addition, I raise a more general, philosophical problem for analytic philosophers who attempt to read Continental philosophy of religion: how should philosophers interpret deliberately ambiguous assertions? For example, what does Irigaray mean in asserting, 'Divinity is what we need to become free, autonomous, sovereign'? To find an answer, I turn to the distinctively French readings of the Hegelian struggle for recognition which have preoccupied Continental philosophers especially since the first half of the last century. I explore the struggle for mutual recognition between women and men who must face the reality of life and death in order to avoid the projection of their fear of mortality onto the other sex. This includes a critical look at Irigaray's account of subjectivity and divinity. I turn to the French philosopher Michèle Le Doeuff in order to shift the focus from divinity to intersubjectivity. I conclude that taking seriously the struggle for mutual recognition between subjects forces contemporary philosophers of religion to be realist in their living and dying. With this in mind, the lesson from the Continent for philosophy of religion is that we must not stop yearning for recognition. Indeed, we must even risk our autonomy/divinity in seeking to recognize intersubjectivity.<br>

Author(s): DiCenso James<br>
Abstract: This paper engages Freud's relation to Kant, with specific reference to each theorist's articulation of the interconnections between ethics and religion. I argue that there is in fact a constructive approach to ethics and religion in Freud's thought, and that this approach can be better understood by examining it in relation to Kant's formulations on these topics. Freud's thinking about religion and ethics participates in the Enlightenment heritage, with its emphasis on autonomy and rationality, of which Kant's model of practical reason is in many ways exemplary. At the same time, Freud advances Kantian thinking in certain important respects; his work offers a more somatically, socially, and historically grounded approach to the formation of rational and ethical capacities, and hence makes it more compatible with contemporary concerns and orientations that eschew the pitfalls of ahistorical idealist orientations.<br>

Author(s): Boyd K. M.<br>
Abstract: Medical ethics, principles, persons, and perspectives is discussed under three headings: "History", "Theory", and "Practice". Under "Theory", the author will say something about some different approaches to the study and discussion of ethical issues in medicine–especially those based on principles, persons, or perspectives. Under "Practice", the author will discuss how one perspectives based approach, hermeneutics, might help in relation first to everyday ethical issues and then to public controversies. In that context some possible advantages of moving from controversy to conversation will be explored; and that will then be illustrated with reference to a current controversy about the use of human embryos in stem cell therapy research. The paper begins with history, and it begins in the author's home city of Edinburgh.<br>

Abstract: The article focuses on autobiographical reflection in relation to the subjective interpretation of contemporary history in written and edited autobiographies. It initially assumes that autobiographical writing and its interpretation are a sociocommunicative act as addressed to an "implied reader". Autobiographies therefore need to be observed from the perspective of the contemporary background. Against the background of literary criticism which questions the principles of the autobiographical genre, the described sociological assumption is theoretically disputed and related to history and memory building. Thus the article asks how contemporary history is constructed within a narrative and shaped by individual experiences in terms of temporary discourse. From this perspective, autobiographies are a result of contemporary history merging with the authors' personal viewpoints.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Nevo Gideon<br>
Abstract: "ימי צקלג" (Days of Ziklag; published in 1958) is the greatest novel, both in scale and in quality, to emerge from what has come to be called "Dor Tashach" (The generation of 1948) or "Dor Ba'aretz" (The generation born in the Land [of Israel]). It is a huge novel, the longest in Hebrew. Some critics have considered it to be so massive, repetitive, and dense as to render it virtually unreadable, doomed to loom on the edge of the field of Hebrew literature like some immense, deserted, dusty old pyramid that nobody visits. This article presents a new reading of one aspect of this great work, that is, its relation to historical reality. This topic has been thoroughly discussed by Avi Ma'apil and Gershon Shaked. In their astute analyses of this aspect, both critics, in different ways, measure "Days of Ziklag" according to a time-honored, normative, regulatory model. My contention is that the model both critics use does not do justice to the novel for it is not able to capture the full depth of its pathos and its ethos, its ardor and its moral commitment, as well as many of its artistic charms. This article proposes an alternative model.<br>

Issue: i27919256<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Smith Jonathan Z.<br>
Abstract: This essay makes explicit what lay behind the author's earlier casual observation that "Tillich remains the unacknowledged theoretician of our entire enterprise"—whether in the AAR or in North American studies of religion more generally. While the article does not make a narrowly (i.e., archivally verified) causal claim about Tillich's influence on the study of religion in the academy, it does point out three crucial roles Tillich's thought and practice played in the development of North American religious studies. (i) Tillich's understanding of religion as an "ultimate concern" provided a language deemed suitable to the new departments of religious studies in this country's higher education institutions (especially at state-run colleges and universities). (ii) Though not uniquely formative of the academy's longstanding discourse on symbolism, Tillich's interest in the symbol served as a legitimating vote of confidence about the worth of that discourse. Moreover, his understanding of the symbol (as that which "points to") ostensibly struck a balance between Eliade's onto-realistic and Geertz's more minimal fictive views of the symbol. (iii) Through his sustained interest in cultural institutions and products of cultural labor—more than through his theories about the relation between religion and culture (e.g., his method of correlation)—Tillich inspired the "dialogic fields" (e.g., Religion and Literature) and subsequent cultural and anthropological studies of religion. The author's earlier claim, then, was intended as a double critique: first, that the study of religion in secular public institutions should ground itself in a Protestant Christian theological project; second, that this influence should remain largely unacknowledged.<br>

Abstract: El autor propugna que el conocimiento en el ámbito de las ciencias sociales no se puede comparar fácilmente con el conocimiento puramente filosófico o el conocimiento histórico ni reducirlo a uno u otro. De hecho, tiene sus raíces en la comunidad y, por lo tanto, da lugar a una empresa colectiva. En esencia, se basa en una interacción entre seres humanos y presupone una relación de confianza mutua entre el investigador y los miembros del grupo social que se va a investigar en una situación dada. Un enfoque cualitativo, que sitúe en un mismo plano al investigador y a los investigados, parece por tanto necesario. Cuesta creer que una persona pueda estar dispuesta a confesar sus experiencias (Erlebnisse) a una grabadora o a un cuestionario rígidamente precodificado. The Author's contention is that knowledge in social science cannot be easily compared and reduced either to purely philosophical knowledge or to historical knowledge. In fact, it is community grounded and therefore it results in a collective enterprise. In essence, it is based on an interaction among human beings and it presupposes a relation of mutual trust between the researcher and the members of the social group to be investigated in a given situation. Therefore, a qualitative approach whereby researcher and researched are in the same footing and involved in a face to face relationship seems to be necessary. It is hard to believe that somebody would willingly confess his/her Erlebnisse to a tape-recording machine or to a rigidly precodified questionnaire.<br>

Abstract: This essay deals with the relation between magic and the nature of words and things. On the one hand, it considers the ways that words confine and direct thought and desire; on the other hand it deals with how the undeniable essence of things provides both limits and reasons for the ways we think. Drawing on these properties of words and objects, magic can be appreciated as a creative and innovative feature of thinking more complex than earlier writers have claimed.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i212655<br>
Date: 10 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Bowen G. Michael<br>
Abstract: In this paper, we describe and theorize the topology of 'vision' in field ecology, a domain considerably different from laboratory work in the physical sciences, and discuss the temporal extension of data-collection practices. Data collection in this field is characterized by widely varying measurements, measurement dimensions and temporal extension of data collection. We present the ecologists' field laboratory as a perceptual machinery with a heterogeneous and heteromaterial topology as it pertains to measures, precision, replication and other material practices. Because of the complexity of ecological fieldwork, considerable co-ordination and articulation work is necessary. Here, tables, tags and labels are central tools to achieve coherence of inscriptions. We topicalize the work that digitizes measurements conducted on lizards and their habitats, and that therefore imposes signs that lend themselves to mathematical and statistical processes. It is only through these digitizing processes that lizards become visible to other (interested) ecologists, most of whom have not seen this particular animal species in person. We thereby contribute in new ways to discussions of the topography and topology of scientific vision, to the relation of measurement to practice, and to the 'adequation' of nature and mathematics.<br>

Abstract: Most analyses of developments in the religious discourse in Calvinist circles of Languedoc after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) have stressed its basic continuity. The expert comparison of sermons before 1685 with subsequent homilies at the end of the 17th century proves this "continuist" hypothesis to be false. Between the two periods, not only did the speakers change but also the structure of the discourse (transitive/intransitive) was modified as well as its relation to the text of reference (compromise on the meaning/ fundamentalism) and the function of speaking itself (intersocial saturation/intracommunity fragmentation). The pacified public discourse became a private one in a zone of textual violence.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that literary theory can no longer afford to adopt an exceptionalist view of its own disciplinary identity and relation to the Western tradition. To this end, it outlines a conceptual framework that distinguishes between competing tendencies within the Western tradition represented by the terms metaphysics and ontology. The implications of this distinction for literary theory are that the most important sources of the latter's disciplinary identity are neither the linguistics-based movement of French structuralism, as the term poststructuralism implies, nor a "modernity" that has been superseded, as the term postmodernism implies, but rather a modernist tradition of aesthetics shaped by eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century German romanticism and idealism.<br>

Date: 9 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Wolff Robert<br>
Abstract: In his book, Art and agency, Alfred Gell presents a theory of art based neither on aesthetics nor on visual communication. Art is defined by the distinctive function it performs in advancing social relationships through 'the abduction of agency'. Art objects are indexes of the artist's or model's agency. This article examines Gell's use of agency, particularly in relation to the ritual art that is central to his argument. Focusing on Gell's employment of Peirce's term 'index' (out of his triad of index, icon, and symbol), I note that Peirce's approach deflects attention from signification towards the link between art works and the things to which they refer. I consider what Peirce meant by abduction, and conclude that while Gell makes a good case for the agency of art objects he does not explain the distinctive ways in which art objects extend their maker's or user's agency. Gell lacked the time to make detailed revisions before publication and I acknowledge that, given more time, he might have revised some parts of the book. / Dans son livre Art and Agency, Alfred Gell présente une théorie de l'art qui ne se base ni sur l'esthétique, ni sur la communication visuelle. Il définit l'art par sa fonction distinctive dans l'établissement de relations sociales, par «l'abduction de l'intentionnalité (agency)». Les objets d'art sont des index de l'intentionnalité de l'artiste ou du modèle. Le présent article analyse l'utilisation par Gell de l'intentionnalité, notamment dans le cadre de l'art rituel qui constitue un axe central de son raisonnement. En se concentrant sur l'usage par Gell du terme «index» de Peirce (dans la trichotomie index, icône, symbole), l'auteur note que l'approche de Peirce prête moins d'attention à la signification qu'au lien entre les œuvres d'art et les objets auxquels elles font référence. Il examine ce que Peirce entendait par «abduction» et en conclut que si Gell s'en tire bien sur l'intentionnalité des objets d'art, il n'explique pas de quelle m~<br>

Abstract: Students of society are increasingly relating the legitimacy crisis facing industrial nations to the erosion of moral traditions. Habermas sees the problem as a historical crisis and calls for the reconstruction of our understanding of moral authority on the basis of practical reason, on which justice and truth rest. The key to our understanding of growth problems is to be found in our cultural situation rather than in the formalistic functional or instrumental theories of positivism. William Sullivan sees a major problem of Habermas's approach, which he subjects to careful examination, in the relation of theoretical understanding to engaged critical activity.<br>

Article Title: Peasant Politics and Secret Societies: The Discourse of Secrecy<br>
Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
Issue: i274773<br>

Author(s): Wolf Robert C.<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Publisher: Editions Ophrys<br>
Issue: i275060<br>
Date: 3 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Young Isabelle<br>
Abstract: L'article fait le point sur la crise de la totalisation en ethnographie et sur les perspectives qui s'offrent actuellement pour la dépasser. Il résume les grandes lignes de l'ethnographie " intégrative " qui s'est constituée dans le prolongement de l'anthropologie sociale et culturelle, autour de l'idée de totalisation monographique. Puis il discute la critique qui en a été faite et les nouvelles formes de rapports entre enquête et écriture qui ont été explorées dans les démarches narratives. Il envisage enfin, sous le terme d'ethnographie " combinatoire ", les pratiques d'enquête qui se sont mises en place dans le cadre de l'interactionnisme puis des développements récents de la sociologie de l'action. Partant de la question de la totalisation des données dans chacune de ces trois formes d'empirie ethnographique, il caractérise les différentes formes d'altérité ainsi constituées dans le cours de l'enquête. /// This article considers the crisis of totalisation in ethnography and the perspectives that are currently available to overstep it. It summarizes the major lines of "integrative ethnography" which has developed as a prolongation of social and cultural anthropology, around the idea of monographical totalisation. The article goes on to discuss the criticism it received and the new types of relation between survey and wiriting that have been explored in the narrative approach. It then imagines ethnographical practice which, by distinguishing between generalisation and totalisation, is put into place in the light of interactionism, then recent developments of action sociology. /// Der Aufsatz berichtet über den heutigen Stand der Totalisierungskrise in der Ethnographie und über die heute bestehende Aussichten, Fortschritte zu verzeichnen.

Publisher: Editions Ophrys<br>
Issue: i275093<br>
Date: 6 1, 1963<br>
Author(s): Wright Dominique<br>
Abstract: Cet article tente de clarifier les concepts de liberté et de contrainte à partir d'une étude de la conception architecturale, activité que les praticiens disent être un espace contraignant tout en parvenant à concevoir des solutions inédites. L'étude vise des résultats factuels et théoriques. Factuels, car il apparaît que les difficultés de l'exercice professionnel ne résultent pas tant des contraintes que de la sur-responsabilisation et de la sous-faisabilité des études qu'elles induisent. Théoriques, car les faits plaident pour une révision fondamentale du rapport négatif par lequel se définissent habituellement la liberté et la contrainte. Ces faits sont par exemple que les interdictions sont moins contraignantes que les prescriptions et que certaines stratégies de " phagocytage " peuvent trouver la voie de la liberté dans le respect à la lettre d'une contrainte. /// This article attempts to clarify the concepts of freedom and constraint through a study of architectural design work, an activity that its practitioners represent as a constraining space, though they in fact manage to find new solutions within it. The study aims at both factual and theoretical results: factual in that the difficulties of exercising this profession seem to be due less to constraints than the excessive degree of responsibility and near impracticability of the studies they induce; theoretical because certain facts suggest that a fundamental revision of the negative relation generally understood to obtain between freedom and constraint is in order. Two examples of such facts: prohibitions are not as constraining as prescriptions, and certain " absorption " strategies can open a path to freedom while following a given constraint " to the letter ". /// Dieser Artikel versucht die Begriffe von Freiheit und Zwang klarzustellen anhand einer Untersuchung von Architekturkonzepten, die die Praktiker als Aktivität in Zwangsräumen beurteilen, in denen trotzdem neue Lösungen möglich sind.

Article Title: Theory, Pragmatism and Truth: Post-Modernism in the Context of Action<br>
Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275803<br>
Date: 4 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: This paper criticizes post-modern and interpretive challenges to positivism by incorporating pragmatism into sociological theory. As an interpretive method, pragmatism is based on the notion that the meaning of ideas is to be found in their consequences for action in definite situations. In contrast to the post-modern "linguistic turn" in which language replaces activity, the pragmatist linkage of meaning to action points to the centrality of experience in realizing the mode of being projected by discourse. By stressing the interrelation of subject and object in definite situations, pragmatism avoids both the subjectivity inherent in the interpretive reliance on actors' perceptions and the false search for universal, abstract theory. The pragmatic emphasis on the consequences of ideas resolves the tension between relativism and objectivism in interpretation by its focus on theory and discourse as guides to action. /// Cet article critique les défis post-moderniste et interprétif au positivisme en incorporant le pragmatisme à la théorie sociologique. Comme méthode interprétative, le pragmatisme est fondé sur le principe que le sens des idées se retrouve dans leurs conséquences pour l'action dans les situations déterminées. Par contraste à la 'tournure linguistique' post-moderniste dans laquelle la langue remplace l'activité, la relation entre le sens et l'action suggérée par le pragmatisme indique la centralité de l'expérience dans la prise de conscience de soi projetée par le discours. En soulignant la relation réciproque entre le sujet et l'objet en situations déterminées, le pragmatisme évite la subjectivité inhérente dans la dépendance de la méthode interprétative sur les perceptions de l'acteur, ainsi que la recherche futile d'une théorie abstraite et universelle. L'importance que le pragmatisme porte sur la conséquence des idées résout la tension entre le relativisme et l'objectivisme de l'interprétation par sa concentration sur la théorie et le discours comme ~<br>

Article Title: Disability Studies: The Old and the New<br>
Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275834<br>
Date: 4 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Zola Tanya<br>
Abstract: This paper does not intend to empirically establish whether Disability Studies is old or new; instead, it aims to uncover what the gloss "new" means in relation to mainstream sociology's rejection of such a claim and the repetitive articulation of it by Disability Studies. Conceptions of disability found in traditional sociological studies of disability-as-deviance are explored, turning first to the work of Goffman and then to a mainstream deviance text book. The paper then uncovers the values and assumptions that lie behind the social act of conceiving Disability Studies as a "new" field of inquiry. Thus, "new" is symbolic of an affirmation of inquiry into ablebodiedness as itself a culture in need of critical engagement. It is also a way to articulate the standpoint of disability as a means to provoke such inquiry. Further, "new" is a rhetorical device to highlight that many Disability Studies researchers are now challenging the mainstream approaches to the study of disability. /// Le but de cet article n'est pas d'établir empiriquement si les études de la condition des personnes handicapées ("Disability Studies") constituent un nouveau ou un vieux champ de recherche. Plutôt, cet article examine la signification du mot "nouveau" dans le contexte de la discussion de l'incapacité dans la sociologie contemporaine. Bien que la sociologie traditionnelle refuse de reconnaître que "Disability Studies" constitue une spécialisation nouvelle, les chercheurs dans ce domaine soulignent que le sujet est nouveau. Cet article examine alors les conceptions de l'incapacité trouvées dans les études traditionnelles, études où l'incapacité est comprise en tant que déviance. D'abord on examine la recherche de Goffman et l'analyse de l'incapacité présentée dans un des manuels standards sur la déviance. Ensuite, cet article découvre les valeurs et les suppositions qui se trouvent derrière l'acte social de concevoir "Disability Studies" comme un "nouveau" champ de recherche. Ainsi, on vo~<br>

Publisher: Religious Research Association<br>
Issue: i284917<br>
Date: 6 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Wulff James E.<br>
Abstract: This paper argues that the question of the relationship between religiosity and mental health has been miscast because both religiosity and mental health have been understood in the discipline from a distinctly modernist perspective. This modernist perspective is characterized by a metaphysic of substances and by empiricism, and it insists that all scientifically interesting relationships must be efficient causal relationships among substances. From this perspective the only legitimate questions revolve around which way the causal arrow points. The paper argues that this framing of the question and the modernist perspective which gives rise to it fail as adequate accounts of either phenomenon and, thus, of their relation. Further, in some fundamental sense the perspective fails to take either religiosity or psychopathology seriously.<br>

Author(s): Witt Janet<br>
Abstract: Contemporary African American followers of Sunni Islam are self-consciously articulating a form of eating that they see as liberating them from the heritage of slavery, while also bringing them into conformity with Islamic notions of purity. In so doing, they participate in arguments about the meaning of "soul food," the relation between "Western" materialism and "Eastern" spirituality, and bodily health and its relation to mental liberation. Debates within the African American Muslim community show us how an older anthropological concern with food taboos can be opened up to history and to the experience of the past reinterpreted in terms of the struggles of the present.<br>

Article Title: Workers in the New Economy: Transformation as Border Crossing<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i370173<br>
Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Walkerdine Valerie<br>
Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Author(s): FreudAbstract: Although the depiction of a Neanderthal people in "The Inheritors" by William Golding is based mainly on the author's imagination and is thus anthropologically untenable, the author's treatment of Oa the earth goddess, worshipped by this tribe, is of unique value and justly represents his key concept. The reciprocity between the symbolic system and the symbol-dissolving element, both inherent in Oa, is very significant regarding cultural, religious, and psychological aspects in relation to the human beings in this novel. This reciprocity helps in the rediscovery of human potentialities that might be repressed and buried under the power structure of a given society.<br>

Abstract: En quoi le western, ce genre cinématographique si typiquement américain, peut-il aider les historiens à réfléchir sur leurs propres méthodes? En comparant les œuvres de John Ford et de Michael Cimino, Christian Delage nous invite à revenir sur la question des temporalités et des représentations de la durée. /// The filmmaker reconstructs the past rather than reconstituting it, and thus meets the historian. The analysis of two major works by John Ford and Michael Cimino shows how the cinema historicizes a past event through the indirect agency of the narrative. In the fiction presented to the audience, the filmmaker, like the historian, faces representations inscribed in general history, while simultaneously modifying its meaning. American cinema carries on an almost ontological relation with duration and time; the question of its truthfulness presents the same methodological challenge as that driving contemporary historical research.<br>

Date: 4 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Zimra Michael F.<br>
Abstract: Assia Djebar's most recent text, "La femme sans sepulture," returns to the site of colonial history to represent the voice of resistance hero Zoulikha, a haunting figure of the author's own personal history represented only nominally in her corpus until now. Representing Zoulikha's return in Algeria as a spectral revisitation, Djebar's text examines both the potential and the vicissitudes of representing colonial violence and resistance through the spectral domain and thus engages critically with tendencies of postcolonial theory to promote haunting as a mode of historical reinscription. Djebar's text explores how haunting relates to cultural and postcolonial memory through an investigation of the issues surrounding the inscription of Zoulikha's story of resistance and torture within the colonial context, and thereby queries the relation between the haunting memories of colonial violence and contemporary civil warfare in Algeria. This article explores, in particular, how Djebar's work engages critically with the spectral aura that haunts both postcolonial place and theory.<br>

Article Title: Is Forgetting Reprehensible? Holocaust Remembrance and the Task of Oblivion<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000757<br>
Date: 6 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Krondorfer Björn<br>
Abstract: "Forgetting" plays an important role in the lives of individuals and communities. Although a few Holocaust scholars have begun to take forgetting more seriously in relation to the task of remembering--in popular parlance as well as in academic discourse on the Holocaust--forgetting is usually perceived as a negative force. In the decades following 1945, the terms remembering and forgetting have often been used antithetically, with the communities of victims insisting on the duty to remember and a society of perpetrators desiring to forget. Thus, the discourse on Holocaust memory has become entrenched on this issue. This essay counters the swift rejection of forgetting and its labeling as a reprehensible act. It calls attention to two issues: first, it offers a critical argument for different forms of forgetting; second, it concludes with suggestions of how deliberate performative practices of forgetting might benefit communities affected by a genocidal past. Is it possible to conceive of forgetting not as the ugly twin of remembering but as its necessary companion?<br>

Publisher: Scholars Press<br>
Issue: i40000773<br>
Date: 4 1, 1988<br>
Author(s): Gunnemann Jon P.<br>
Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Author(s): Reeder John P.<br>
Abstract: In order to sketch an account of a moral commitment to persons as such, the essay examines empathy, sympathy, and benevolence as they arise first in special relations and then are reconstructed to include the stranger under the rubric of "extensive benevolence" or "universal love." The account, the author argues, must deal with conceptual empowerment and authorizing reasons, weakness and evil, normative conflict, and the relation of benevolence to justice.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000789<br>
Date: 7 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the relations of faith, love, and hope suggests a unique approach to theological ethics, one that holds fresh promise for bringing together considerations of the good (teleology) and the right (deontology) around the notion of an "economy of the gift." The economy of the gift articulates Ricoeur's distinctively dialectical understanding of the relation of the human and the divine, and the resulting dialectical moral relation of the self and the other. Despite our fallen condition, Ricoeur suggests, we are called by the divine to embrace the radical possibility of the reconciliation of human goods under the requirement of accountability to human diversity and otherness.<br>

Author(s): Graber Glenn C.<br>
Abstract: This paper offers a listing of references to religious ethics in recent Anglo-American philosophical literature, organized in terms of a critical analysis of the main lines of argument to be found there. The principal focus is on metaethics, although references are included to other aspects of religious ethics. The author maintains that the case for a logical and/or a linguistic relation between religion and ethics is much stronger than is generally recognized in the philosophical discussions of these issues.<br>

Author(s): Young Josiah Ulysses<br>
Abstract: This review essay explores Josiah Young's project of developing a liberatory Pan-Africanism that is attuned to cultural diversity and Victor Anderson's advocacy of postmodern cultural criticism in African-American religious thought. After situating African-American religious thought as a branch of Africana thought, the author examines these two religious thinkers' work as an effort to forge a position on African-American religious thought--including its relation to theology--in an age where even theory is treated as a god that is about to die. At the conclusion, secularism emerges as a religious project that normatively undergirds the methodological dimensions of these works..<br>

Author(s): Farley Margaret A.<br>
Abstract: One way into the question of the relation of ethics and liturgy is to focus on a critical issue facing liturgy today: its impoverishment and inability to nurture Christian faith and life. Three aspects of this problem are: injustice within the worshipping community, disagreement regarding forms of Christian service to the world, and the breakdown of symbols. Ethics must move beyond the articulation of formal principles and assertions regarding the importance of liturgy for the moral agent if it is to fulfill its task vis-à-vis these problems.<br>

Author(s): Pettigrove Glen<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the relation between understanding and forgiving. A number of people have argued against the old adage that to understand is to forgive, for in many instances understanding leads to excusing rather than forgiving. Nonetheless, there is an interesting connection to be found between forgiving and understanding. I identify three ways in which understanding can lead to forgiveness of unexcused wrongdoing: It can do so by changing our interpretation of the actor, by changing our interpretation of the action, and by engaging self-love.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40011337<br>

Author(s): Brown Tony<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a Special Issue of Educational Studies in Mathematics comprising research reports centred on Peircian semiotics in mathematics education, written by some of the major authors in the area. The paper is targeted at inspecting how subjectivity is understood, or implied, in those reports. It seeks to delineate how the conceptions of subjectivity suggested are defined as a result of their being a function of the domain within which the authors reflexively situate themselves. The paper first considers how such understandings shape concepts of mathematics, students and teachers. It then explores how the research domain is understood by the authors as suggested through their implied positioning in relation to teachers, teacher educators, researchers and other potential readers.<br>

Author(s): Lara Gabriela<br>
Abstract: The article explores the social meaning of the songs written and performed during the revolutionary Democratic Kampuchea period in Cambodia (1975-1979), hoping thereby to better understand the ideology of the Khmer Rouge as it relates to aesthetic and the degree to which such an aesthetic may be related to the abuses of power associated with the period. The article summarizes what is known about how the songs were generated and used: on radio broadcasts, at political meeting, and as part of revolutionary theater. It discusses the social implications of the ways the songs were used in meetings and at work sites, and the power generated by the fact that the songs were used to the exclusion of earlier kinds of songs. Finally, the article analyzes three songs found in Khmer Rouge song books, in terms of the attitudes expressed toward nature, labor, youth, and the relationship of the sexes. It explores the idea of irony, and how the "meaning" of the songs may have been tinged with greater and greater irony in relation to the changing reality of the Cambodian revolution.<br>

Issue: i40014414<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Morujão Alexandre Fradique<br>
Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Abstract: O estudo visa apresentar os supostos teóricos e as tensões essenciais da tematização da ideia de Quinto Império na Defesa Perante o Tribunal do Santo Ofício, do P.e António Vieira. A visão profética de Vieira assume o contraste entre um tempo de inautenticidade na relação teândrica, subsidiário da Queda adâmica e objectivado na sucessão dos quatro impérios (cf. Daniel, 2, 27-45), e a novidade absoluta do acontecimento de Cristo, que se espera vir a manifestar-se na pacificação terrena do processo histórico e na constituição duma comunidade universal segundo o Espírito. A tese, que só um estudo ulterior poderá demonstrar, é a de que a perspectiva do Quinto Império, em Vieira, será, ainda subsidiária das categorias dominantes no tempo dos quatro impérios, em que a experiência escatológica se refracta antropocentricamente pelas finalidades, e relações de poder, político-civilizacionais. /// Cette étude presente les présupposés théoriques et les tensions essentielles de Ia thématisation de Tidée de Cinquième Empire dans Ia Défense Auprès du Tribunal du Saint-Office, du P.

Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis.

Abstract: O tema principal deste artigo incide na relação entre a metafísica de Deus e a abordagem de Deus na filosofia da religião. Três modelos são apresentados, respectivamente sob os títulos seguintes: 1) o caminho da filosofia para a fé; 2) a filosofia e a fé no mesmo caminho; 3) o caminho da fé para a filosofia. Os modelos apoiam-se sobre: 1) Tomás de Aquino, na primeira parte; 2) Hegel, na segunda e 3) a hermenêutica contemporânea, na terceira. Não se trata de repetir esses autores, mas de tentar decifrar o momento especulativo próprio de cada um no que diz respeito à articulação do Deus da metafísica com o Deus da fé. /// Le thème principal de cet article concerne la relation entre la métaphysique de Dieu et l'approche de Dieu en philosophie de la religion. Trois modèles sont proposés, respectivement: 1) le chemin de la philosophie vers la foi; 2) la philosophie et la foi sur le même chemin; 3) le chemin de la foi vers la philosophie. Ces modèles s'appuient sur les auteurs ou courants philosophiques suivants: Thomas d'Aquin dans la première partie; Hegel, dans la seconde; l'herméneutique contemporaine dans la troisième. Il ne s'agit pas de répéter ces auteurs, mais de dégager le moment spéculatif de chacun quant à l'articulation du Dieu de la métaphysique avec le Dieu de la foi. /// The principal them of this article has to do with the religion that can be established between the God of metaphysics and that which can be discerned in the philosophy of religion. Three models are presented: 1) the path from philosophy to faith; 2) philosophy and faith on this very path; 3) the path from fait to philosophy. These three models are based respectively on the following: 1) Thomas Aquinas; 2) Hegel; and 3) contemporary hermeneutics. It is not a matter of repeating these others, but rather to capture the speculative moment that can be found in each and that contribute to the articulation of he God of metaphysics with the God of faith.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo tem por tema a relação entre a Filosofia da História e a problemática epistemólogica da complexidade. A teoria do conhecimento histórico ou epistemologia da História nao pode ser vista de modo linear ou unívoco porque tem sofrido mutações nos seus quadros conceptuais compáraveis às revoluções cientificas concebidas pelo filosofo e historiador das ciências Thomas Kuhn, destacando-se quatro paradigmas (continuando a usar a terminologia deste autor) do conhecimento histórico: o paradigma "omnicompreensivo", que visa compreender o sentido global da História e tem como representante máximo Hegel, retomado no contexto actual por Francis Fukuyama com a sua tese sobre o tlm da Historia: o paradigma positivista guiado por uma ideia de objectividade do conhecimento histórico hoje considerada redutora: o relativismo emergente com o "fim das grandes narrativas de legitimação do saber" e a fragmentação do sentido no pensamento pós-modemo; e a "História aberta" ao misterio do tempo, problematizadora, que constrói o seu objecto na complexidade da relação interdisciplinar com outros saberes, limitada aos instrumentos conceptuais ou técnicos do historiador e excedendo qualquer sistema conceptual fechado mas mantendo uma inquietacao metodologica orientada pela busca interminável de sentido. É este último paradigma -epistemológico, hermenêutico e histórico - que é defendido neste estudo. /// This essay deals with the relation between the philosophy of history and the epistemological problem of complexity.

Abstract: Objectivo dopresente artigo é estabelecer a relação entre a filosofia hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer e a teologia, a partir do estudo da referênda mútua que existe entre ambas. Analisa, por um lado, a influência da questão hermenêutica, em tor no a Bultmann, à "Teologia da Palavra" e ao próprio Heidegger, sobre a formulção filosofica de Gadamer; por outro, analisa a influencia exercida pela filosofia hermenêutica de Gadamer sobre a discussão teológica posterior, sobretudo ao nível da Teologia Fundamental, ou seja, de uma reflexão sobre os pressupostos hermenêuticos da própria teologia. Chega-se, desta forma, a uma tematização da metafisica, na confluência entre filosofia e teologia. O artigo salienta também a importância das reflexões de Gadamer sobre a arte e o tempo, pelas possibilidades que, para além da hermenêutica restrita, abrem ao estabelecimento de outrospontos de ligação entre a filosofia e a teologia. /// Ojective of the present article is to establish a relation between Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics and theology on the basis of an overlapping thematics. On the one hand, there is the influence of the hermeneutical question, centered around Bultmann's "Theology of the Word" and Heidegger's work, on Gadamer's philosophical discourse. On the other hand, Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics excercised an influence on fundamental theology, particularly in relation to the hermeneutical presuppositions operative in the theological enterprise. Metaphysical thematics can be thus found at the point where philosophy and theology converge. The article seeks, in addition, to bring out the importance of Gadamer's reflexions on art and time as especially useful in establishing other common concerns shared by philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: Descartes atribui enorme importância aos três sonhos que teve na noite de São Martinho de 1619, que liga directamente ao descobrimento da sua via científica, quer no Discurso do Método, quer nas Meditações. O presente estudo procura compreender filosoficamente este episódio onírico e a autointerpretação cartesiana, numa perspectiva filosófica, que une referências históricas e psicanalíticas, mas encontra a sua fenomenologia na projecção extática do tempo e na experiência da dualidade. /// Descartes describes the three dreams he dreamed the night of Saint Martin 1619 as a most important episode in relation with the discovery of his method and system, as he says in the Discours de la Méthode and in the Méditations. The present paper aims to understand them in a hermeneutical and phenomenological way, without forgetting the relevance of the psychoanalytical and historical interpretation. The clue to the dreams is founded in the ecstatic projection of time and in the experience of dualism.<br>

Abstract: No presente ensaio trata-se da relação entre filosofia e cristianismo no século XX a partir da consideração de uma problemática comum a estas experiências: o eclipse do sentido, ou seja, a perda de referênda a um horizonte a partir do qual o ser humano pode orientar-se na vida. Esta problemática, diferentemente declinada nas formas do excesso do mal, do niilismo e da indiferença religiosa, é uma das heranças com que hoje tanto a filosofia como o cristianismo têrn de se debater. O presente artigo reconstrói uma "genealogia filosófica" da atitude de indiferença e oferece deste fenómeno uma análise articulada. A partir daqui apresentam-se duas soluçõoes possíveis, capazes de unir ainda filosofia e cristianismo e que estão em posição defavorecer novas formas de co-implicação entre Deus, homem e mundo: a referênda aos aspectos "positivos" da indiferença e a atenção à esfera do emocional, na qual as motivações têrn ainda espaço. /// The present essay deals with the relation between philosophy and Christianity in the 20 th Century in relation to the eclipse of meaning, i. e., the lack of a horizon that constitutes a point of reference by which one might orient his/her life. This problematic, affected differently by excesses of evil, nihilism, and religious indifference in the last century, is at the heart of the debate. In view of this, the present article offers a "philosophical genealogy" of the attitude of indifference. On the basis of an analysis of this phenomenon, it proposes two possible solutions that might bring philosophy and Christianity together by reformulating the ways that God, man, and the world may be seen as co-implicated and by considering how this indifference can have positive aspects.<br>

Abstract: A obra principal de Bernard Lonergan Inteligência: Um ensaio sobre o conhecimento humano, é um tratado que leva a cabo uma integração segundo o método transcendental dos conhecimentos heterogéneos da ciência, da filosofia, do senso comum e da teologia. A obra visa a auto-apropriação da nossa auto-consciência intelectual e racional com base na experiência consciente dos actos de intelecção. Começa como teoria cognitiva, expande-se para uma metafísica e uma ética, e avança para uma concepção e uma afirmação de Deus, para ser finalmente confrontada com o problema do mal que exige a transformação da inteligência auto-confiante no intellectus quaerens fidem. Ao cumprir estes objectivos, Inteligência tornou-se uma das mais importantes obras de filosofia do século XX, aqui sucintamente elucidada em cinco das suas principais vertentes: a relação entre conhecimento e realidade, conhecimento científico e cosmologia, a acção humana e a ética, as questões de interpretação, a relação entre natureza de Deus e filosofia. O artigo conclui com uma avaliação da cosmopolis lonerganiana, ou seja, o poder da comunidade de espírito na sociedade. /// Bernard Lonergan s opus magnum, Insight: A Study of human understanding, handles the heterogeneous fields of knowledge as given in science, philosophy, common sense and theology according to a transcendental method. The work aims at the self-appropriation of human intellectual and rational self-conscience as based in the conscious experience of insight. Lonergan s work starts as a cognitive theory, and advances, through metaphysics and ethics, to a conception and affirmation of God, one that is confronted with the problem of evil and therefore requires a transformation of self-confident intelligence into the intellectus quaerens fidem. Handling these goals, Insight became one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20 th century. The present article deals with five of the main issues in Lonergan s work: the relation between knowledge~<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40016648<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Sperl Stefan<br>
Abstract: Classical Arabic Ḥadīth literature is largely composed of micronarratives recording the sayings and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad. This study seeks to examine their literary form by focusing on selected examples listed in the canonical Hadīth compendia under the heading of adab, a term which may be rendered here as "practical ethics" but which is also commonly used to designate classical Arabic belles-lettres. While the latter is a type of literature quite distinct from the literature of Hadīth the texts here studied point to a certain interface between them. The ethical dimension of adab as it appears in Hadith is examined further in the light of Haydon White's theory on the relation between narrativity and law. Contrasting the micro-narrative of Ḥadīth with the "macronarrative" of the epic provides further insight into its approach to adab and serves to highlight its distinct literary and religious aesthetic.<br>

Author(s): Jorge Maria Manuel Araújo<br>
Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar conta de alguns dos aspectos mais salientes da questão relativa à pertinência da Filosofia (especialmente na qualidade de Filosofia da Ciência) para a prática científica dos cientistas. Nesse sentido, a autora recorre sobretudo a exemplos vigentes nos finais do século xx, dando especial relevância a manifestações de "impaciência" por parte de alguns investigadores em relação a algumas críticas epistemológicas e éticas dos filósofos, sobretudo no que se refere à famosa controvérsia da "guerra das ciências" e a toda uma ofensiva cultural relativa a uma terceira cultura que apresenta os cientistas como sendo os novos humanistas e em que os "filósofos empíricos" estariam a perder peso. Como resposta, a autora propõe que, embora possam ser dispensáveis no laboratório, aos filósofos deve ser reconhecida a capacidade de disponibilizar às ciências uma linguagem que seja capaz de facilitar o diálogo cultural alargado, uma linguagem, portanto, de que as próprias ciências não se poderão dispensar se realmente quiserem sobreviver no âmbito da cultura do século XXI. /// The present article intends to give an account of some of the more relevant aspects pertaining to the question about the importance of Philosophy, and in particular Philosophy of Science, for the scientific work of scientists. The author of the article gives special attention to examples taken from the scientific landscape at the end of the xx Century, whereby special consideration is given to the impatience shown by some scientists in relation to some epistemological and ethical criticisms coming from the side of Philosophy. Particular attention is given to the famous "war of sciences" and the cultural offensive related to the introduction of a third culture in which the scientists are presented as the new humanists and in which even the "empirical philosophers" were losing weight. In that sense, the author suggests that, even though they might be of not much use in the laboratory,~<br>

Author(s): Margulis Mario<br>
Abstract: La ciudad habla a sus habitantes. En este artículo se presenta a la ciudad como texto, susceptible de distintas lecturas. Este nivel significativo orienta los comportamientos urbanos, da cuenta de su trama social y contiene las huellas de las decisiones históricas que incidieron en su construcción. En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Abstract: The intention of the article is to demonstrate the dialectical relation of self-understanding and understanding of the Other within ethnological interpretation. Proceeding from the conflict between the estimation of the reality of the Chachilla-Indians (formerly called Cayapa) on the part of a protestant missionary and the ethnologist, the whole ethnological enterprise turns out not to aim at "structures," "actions," or other "objects" but at the multiple forms of understanding with which it is confronted and of which itself is a part. Because of this hermeneutical orientation ethnological knowledge necessarily remains open for corrections and reinterpretations.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40020159<br>
Date: 7 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Mathuray Mark<br>
Abstract: This paper departs from and problematizes the almost exclusive focus in criticism of Ngugi's early works on Christianity and the effects of the colonial intrusion. Following Ngugi's exhortation to resume the broken dialogue with the gods of his people, Ngugi's early novels are read in relation to precolonial East African discourses and practices of prophecy, Gikuyu religion, and Gikuyu nationalist strategies that drew on different and opposing prophetic traditions, and, in a broader sense, discourses of religion in Africa. By locating his early work within the nexus of these discourses, a far more nuanced view of Ngugi's relation to religious and nationalist discourses emerges. This paper also attempts to uncover a symbolic geometry in Ngugi's novels determined by Gikuyu religious and cultural concepts. A focus on The River Between reveals certain authorial deployments of historical inaccuracies and dislocations in the interests of a schematization of the conflicts in the novel.<br>

Abstract: Le texte poétique de Saint-John Perse abonde en termes techniques. Il s'agit de mots savants, de termes de métiers, de vocables appartenant à la mythologie, aux sciences physiques et naturelles, à l'histoire, etc.. Ce fait est original dans la poésie française, en particulier celle du XXe siècle. Après une description des types d'emploi, on a cherché à en expliquer le mécanisme et les effets, et l'on a mis ce phénomène en relation avec l'idée que Saint-John Perse se fait de la poésie et du langage poétique: goût pour l'étrangeté des mots, recherche d'une "coïncidence" entre le langage et le réel, volonté d'exprimer le mouvement d'unité à partir du caractère multiforme du monde, sont chez le poète les signes de "son adhésion totale à ce qui est" (Discours de Stockholm, Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, p. 446).<br>

Author(s): Béguin Édouard<br>
Abstract: Quel sens donner aujourd'hui à cette question ? Il y va de la compréhension de la théorie du réalisme d'Aragon. La notion de "réalisme socialiste" dont il s'est réclamé à partir de 1933 et qu'il a toujours revendiquée depuis, même après l'interruption du Monde Réel, soulève plus de difficultés qu'elle n'aide à en résoudre. Pour relancer l'investigation tout en faisant droit à l'ambition réaliste de l'auteur, on place Aurélien dans l'ombre portée que projette sur lui la suite de l'entreprise romanesque. Le roman apparaît ainsi au point de départ de la réécriture par quoi Aragon dépassera l'échec des Communistes, et qui aboutira à la définition d'un "réalisme expérimental". Cette nouvelle problématique théorique trouve un écho anticipé dans un texte contemporain de la rédaction d'Aurélien, l'article intitulé "Grandeur et misère des romanciers", où Aragon donne à penser le réalisme romanesque à partir du problème de la lecture. C'est ainsi qu'on peut ramener la question du réalisme dans Aurélien à celle des moyens par lesquels le roman se fait relation dialogique.<br>

Author(s): Kosmicki Guillaume<br>
Abstract: Cet article se propose de comprendre le sens musical d'une production de techno dite underground. Au travers de l'analyse de « Let's play » de Crystal Distortion, un artiste réputé de la mouvance free party (ou techno clandestine), on examine principalement la coexistence douloureuse des valeurs utopiques de ce mouvement, aujourd'hui considérablement affaiblies, avec le statut inévitablement commercial du disque sur lequel figure la composition. L'opposition pourrait être frontale, une de ces valeurs premières étant justement le refus de la société marchande, mais on décèle au travers de différentes analyses de nombreuses stratégies pour cacher au mieux l'aspect commercial attelé au morceau. En effet, tout ce qui met une œuvre en situation contribue à son sens, et c'est pourquoi nous consacrons du temps à exposer certains aspects du mouvement acquis par un long travail de terrain et de nombreuses observations participantes : la présentation des valeurs de la free party ; son historique ; la manière dont est considéré Crystal Distortion par les acteurs du mouvement ; ainsi que le fait qu'il vende cette production sur CD (la plupart des productions étant normalement tirées uniquement sur vinyle car destinées au mix par des DJs). Puis nous passons à l'examen des éléments composant la jaquette du CD pour en arriver enfin à l'analyse interne de la production, en relation avec les précédentes strates de l'analyse. The purpose of this paper is to understand the musical meaning of a production of so-called underground techno music. Through the analysis of "Let's play" by Crystal Distortion, a famous artist from the free party trend (or underground techno trend), one examines the painful coexistence of the Utopian values of the movement, tremendously weakened today, with the unavoidable commercial status of the record in which the composition appears. The confrontation could be frontal, as one of these essential values precisely is the refusal of consumer society; but one de~<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles?

Abstract: L'auteur tente dans ce texte d'éclaircir certains aspects de l'imaginaire en relation avec l'Etat, la politique, mais aussi avec la violence et le mal, dans un contexte où la dialectique de l'identité et de l'altérité reste l'une des structures de l'imaginaire. L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: Après les nombreuses tentatives menées par les sociologues pour élaborer une analyse permettant de saisir la relation dialectique de la structure sociale et des acteurs A. Giddens propose une « théorie générale » centrée sur la notion de « structuration » . Le postulat fondamental de sa théorie se constitue autour de la notion de « dualité de structure » , en référence à la nature recursive des pratiques sociales. Selon cette thèse, les systèmes sociaux sont produits par des acteurs, qui par leurs activités mêmes contribuent à la constitution et à la reconstruction permanente de ces mêmes systèmes de rapports sociaux. Les agents et les structures ne sont pas considérés comme indépendants, ils se lient dans une relation mutuelle complexe et complémentaire. After the numerous attempts on the part of sociologists to elaborate a theoretical approach that incorporates the duality of structure and human agency, A. Giddens proposes a « general theory » focused on the notion of « structuration ». Rather than seeing action and structure as oppositions within a dualism, he suggests to regard them as the complementary terms of the duality of structure. Every act of production is at the same time an act of reproduction : the structures that render an action possible are, in the performance ofthat action, reproduced.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo discute, através da relação entre histleória e literatura e dos parâmetros da História Cultural, a temática da loucura na literaturamemória de Lima Barreto. Os escritos deste autor pré-modernista brasileiro, principalmente aqueles originados durante sua última internação manicomial, Diario do Hospicio, serviram de fonte privilegiada para descortinar-mos urna «sensibilidade da exclusão» , a qual tomou urna forma mais literária em seu romance inacabado Cemitério dos Vivos. Cet article traite de la folie dans la littérature-mémoire de Lima Barreto, à travers le rapport entre histoire et littérature dans le cadre de l'Histoire Culturelle. Les écrits de cet auteur brésilien pré-moderniste, surtout ceux qui proviennent, dans Diário do Hospício, de son dernier internement psychiatrique, ont servi comme source privilégiée pour dévoiler une certaine «sensibilité de l'exclusion» , devenue littérature dans le roman inachevé Cemiténo dos Vivos. This article deals with insanity in the literature-memory of Lima Barreto through the relation between history and literature within the framework of Cultural History. The writings of this Brazilian pre-modernist author, specially those that deal with his last confinement, taken from Diario do Hospicio, have been used as a privileged source to reveal a certain «sensibility of exclusion» , which becomes closer to literary expression in the last unfinished novel, Cemiténo dos Vivos.<br>

Abstract: Pre-colonial histories in Southeast Asia are generally dependent on a very limited number of written sources. Most information originates from the elites among dominant ethnic groups or Westerners. These centralized histories are frequently uncritically treated as the 'truth.' This is especially true in countries like Laos, where historical documents are rare. But different versions of widely accepted histories also exist, and these often-contested histories remain prominent in the minds of people from different ethnic groups. This paper demonstrates the contested nature of history in Laos and the importance of ethnicity in social memory, using a well-known historical event that occurred in southern Laos— the Ay Sa Rebellion of the early nineteenth century. Lao, Siamese, and Western versions of the history of this rebellion are reviewed, followed by oral histories obtained from ethnic Brao people who maintain memories of the events that transpired. I hope to demonstrate the importance of considering ethnicity in relation to histories, and to encourage others to investigate alternative versions of histories in Laos.<br>

Abstract: Lately, the concept of experience, which postmodernist theoreticians declared dead, has seen renaissance. The immediacy of experience seems to offer the possibility of reaching beyond linguistic discourses. In their attempt to overcome the "linguistic turn," scholars such as Ankersmit, Gumbrecht, and Runia pit experience against narrative. This paper takes up the recent interest in experience, but argues against the opposition to narrative into which experience tends to be cast. The relation between experience and narrative is more complex than is widely assumed. Besides representing and giving shape to experience, narratives are received in the form of a (reception) experience. Through their temporal structure, narratives are crucial to letting us re-experience the past as well as to representing the experiences of historical agents. This potential of narrative is nicely illustrated by Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War in which "side-shadowing" devices restore history's experientiality. Through "side-shadowing," narrative can challenge the tendency toward teleologies inherent in merely retrospective histories and can re-create the openness intrinsic to the past when it still was a present. However, the "side-shadowing" devices used by Thucydides are fictional. To conceptualize the price and gain of "side-shadowing" in historiography, the paper advances the concept of a "narrative reference" (a concept analogous to Ricoeur's "metaphorical reference"). Introspection, speeches, and other "side-shadowing" devices sacrifice truth in a positivist sense, but permit a second-level reference, namely to history's experientiality. In a final step, the paper turns toward modern historians—most of whom are reluctant to use the means of fiction—to briefly survey their attempts at restoring the openness of the past.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: II n'y a rien d'étonnant à ce que la religion soit au départ de la philosophie. Sicelle-ci poursuit la connaissance la plus ample et la plus approfondie de la réalité telle qu'elle nous est donnée, elle ne peut faire abstraction de la religion comme phénomène humain universel, c'est-à-dire comme un fait qui a un sens. Ce sens nous paraît être donné dans une expérience du rapport réel de l'homme qui prie, avec Dieu, soi-même, le prochain et le monde. Cet article se limite aux relations de l'homme qui prie avec soi-même, le dialogue ego-(Dieu)-ego. Ce dialogue est un effort de sincérité au sens d'authenticité. La sincérité de l'homme qui prie apporte, en premier lieu, de la clarté et de l'unité dans l'homme lui-même. Dans la prière une harmonie s'établit à un triple niveau : au plan extérieurintérieur : je me présente à Dieu tel que je suis ; au plan de la temporalité : une unité se fait dans ma vie à la suite de la compréhension du présent avec une rétention du passé et une protention vers l'avenir ; au plan du rapport moi-réel et moi-idéal se manifeste un mouvement vers l'honnêteté et la loyauté. La prière de contrition éclaire la formation de mon moi au point de départ ; l'impétration d'une vie morale au point d'arrivée. En cas d'accord du moi-extérieur avec le moi-profond, tout n'est pas encore dit. Il importe de savoir comment va s'orienter le moi-fondamental. Vais-je me replier orgueilleusement sur moi-même ou m'ouvrir humblement à Dieu ? Le choix ultime : Dieu / moi-même, déterminera la qualité de l'ego. Celui qui choisit Dieu entrera en une relation d'amour avec lui. Non seulement l'amour unit, mais il exige l'abandon de tout ce qui n'est pas la personne aimée. La vie de l'homme qui prie se présente comme un rapprochement de Dieu et un abandon toujours plus prononcé de tout le reste. C'est un processus d'abaissement qui commence, basé sur la collaboration de Dieu et de l'homme. Parfois l'initiative de l'homme prédomine, comme dans l'ascèse, parfois celle de Di~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Cette conférence présente une méditation sur un livre dans lequel les problèmes philosophiques semblent déborder tant les frontières du récit de fiction que le cadre du roman dit historique. Plutôt que d'entreprendre une analyse tant soit peu exhaustive du livre de Eco, elle s'étend, tout en s'inspirant des données fournies par celui-ci, sur une question préalable, mais qui commande en un sens toute lecture ultérieure, celle notamment des connivences entre le discours philosophique et le discours littéraire, question finalement assez proche de celle du statut de la fiction dans son rapport au dire-vrai. L'auteur du Nom de la rose nous fait prendre conscience de ce rapport par la mise en place d'une série de dispositifs narratifs et discursifs relevant, d'une part, du moyen âge (la chronique, le raisonnement à partir de « principes premiers » ), d'autre part, de la modernité (le roman policier, la sémiotique ) ; il y a lieu de parler ici d'une structure polyphonique délibérément discordante, constamment traversée d'échos de livres anciens, nouveaux, voire inexistants. C'est dans ce jeu de textes se reflétant que le vrai et l'imaginaire s'entremêlent ; c'est là aussi que s'ouvre cet espace apocalyptique et ambigu où le sens momentanément en suspens est donné à se chercher et se redéfinir sur un mode encore inconnu et par conséquent catastrophique. L'image du labyrinthe acquiert ici tout son poids. L'effet signalé peut être défini comme un phénomène de dislocation. Ce même phénomène est ensuite approfondi à l'aide de trois points qui jouent dans Le nom de la rose un rôle important : 1. la rupture qu'opère dans le discours médiéval le personnage de William, 2. la signification de la souffrance dans sa relation au langage, 3. la dialectique du rire. C'est surtout ce dernier qui, à travers son rapport à l'idée de « césure » (césure du comique, césure du tragique), fait apparaître la theâtralité foncière de tout comportement humain. L'exposé se termine par l'hypothèse, pru~<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: Différence, référence, communicabilité : trois mots-clés pour dessiner la structure originaire et élémentaire de la signifiance. Or, l'interrogation change de nature quand on la déplace du signifié vers le sens, puis vers la signifiance. Il ne s'agit ni d'une action, ni d'un événement, mais d'un processus. Trois conditions nécessaires : présence d'un matériel signifiant (sonore, graphique, électronique) ; aptitude à se référer à une réalité extérieure ; énonciateurs en relation binaire entre lesquels et pour lesquels les énoncés signifient. L'auteur examine les conséquences de leur considération groupée en philosophie du langage. Difference, reference and communicability are three key-words to outline the original and elementary structure of« signifying ». Now, the nature of philosophical interrogation changes when it shifts from the saussurian « signifié » towards the meaning, a fortiori towards signifying. It is neither an action nor an event but a process. Three conditions are necessary : the presence of specific material (whether acoustic, graphic or electronical) ; an aptitude to refer to an outside reality ; speakers standing in binary relationship. The writer examines the consequences of considering the constraints as gathered in a philosophy of language.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science app~<br>

Issue: i378409<br>
Date: 9 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Woodside Tine<br>
Abstract: Intertwining ethnographic and literary accounts, this article explores the mutual relationship between suffering and agency. The article describes how young Vietnamese women use narrative to find meaning in the suffering that a late-term abortion causes. Seeking to further develop anthropological use of the concept of social suffering, the article argues that existing scholarship has tended to neglect the importance of human agency and imagination, hinging as it does on suffering as entrenched within structural forces. The article contends that this neglect must be understood in the context of the particular epistemological and ethical conditions under which anthropological studies of human suffering are produced, and that closer attention to the human engagements out of which ethnographic accounts are fashioned may bring into analysis not only the harm that social forces can inflict on people, but also their capacities for action and imagination. / Mêlant ethnographic et récits littéraires, l'article explore la relation réciproque entre souffrance et agency. Il décrit comment les jeunes femmes vietnamiennes utilisent la narration pour trouver un sens à la souffrance causée par une fausse couche tardive. Visant à élargir l'utilisation anthropologique du concept de souffrance humaine, l'auteur montre que les études tendent à négliger l'importance de l'agency et de l'imagination, qui s'articule sur la souffrance enracinée dans les forces structurelles. L'auteur affirme que cette négligence doit être comprise dans le contexte de conditions épistémologiques et éthiques particulières dans lesquelles sont produites les études anthropologiques de la souffrance humaine, et qu'une analyse plus attentive des engagements humains desquels sont issus les récits ethnographiques peut introduire dans la réflexion non seulement le mal que les forces sociales peuvent infliger aux individus, mais aussi les capacités d'action et d'imagination de ceux-ci.<br>

Author(s): Zizek Tyler<br>
Abstract: "Always historicize": Frederic Jameson's imperative today exerts a powerful influence on the study of religion. It informs a wide range of methods and, perhaps more important, it shapes influential definitions of religion and religious subjectivity and agency. This article examines this influence and argues for the necessity of thinking the limits of historicism. Building on Robert Orsi's efforts to identify a space for academic exploration in-between religious testimony/narrative and social-scientific diagnosis/ explanation, I turn to recent efforts by Eric Santner and Slavoj Zizek to articulate a concept of subjectivity-tied closely to Franz Rosenzweig's concept of "revelation"-in "excess" of history and ideology. Santner and Zizek do not argue for a new, extra-historical foundation for agency and for religious claims but rather theorize and intervene in the "syntax" by which we are bound to history and society. This approach to historicism allows the scholar of religion to enrich accounts of creative religious agency at the same time that it forces them to rethink their relation to religious phenomena and religious subjects in terms of what the anthropologist Michael Jackson calls "encounter."<br>

Author(s): Campe Rüdiger<br>
Abstract: The figuration of "evidenþia" is a rather poorly documented and rarely debated branch of the rhetorical production of images although it is closely connected with the emergence of the notion of "Darstellung" in 18th-century aesthetics. Two features of this proto-aesthetical device will be discussed: The first characteristic is the diagrammatical nature of this figure—examples used are geometrical diagrams or statistical tables rather than pictorial images. The second characteristic is the inherent relation to media translation—the diagrammatic "image" is produced through and "instead of" words and sentences evoking that image. Both aspects underline the relation of the evidential image to language and writing.<br>

Abstract: Em Portugal, o enquadramento sócio-político da droga constitui-se enquanto um «campo» especializado que se legitima através de um interdito absoluto. Neste artigo analisam-se os resultados de urna investigação sobre representações sociais da droga junto de párocos e médicos, relacionando-os com a forma pela qual os agentes políticos e médicos formulam simbolicamente o interdito. Este é apresentado em três planos cognitivos. Assim, analisa-se criticamente (a) o espaço semântico em que a droga é inscrita e que objectiva o seu consumidor como urna não-pessoa, (b) um dos princípios mais estruturantes do pensar e do agir em relaçâo à droga: a escalada farmacológica, e (c) a crença de que «a droga causa crime». Au Portugal, l'encadrement socio-politique de la drogue s'est constitué en un «champ» spécialisé qui est légitimé au travers d'un interdit absolu. Dans cet article, on analyse les résultats d'une recherche portant sur les représentations sociales de la drogue auprès de prêtres et de médecins. Ces résultats sont mis en relation avec le mode de formulation symbolique de l'interdit par les agents politiques et les médecins. Cet interdit est présenté selon trois plans cognitifs. Ainsi, analyse-t-on de façon critique (a) l'espace sémantique dans lequel est inscrit la drogue, et qui objective son consommateur comme une non-personne, (b) un principe de pensée et d'action parmi les plus structurants en matière de drogue: l'échelle pharmacologique, (c) la croyance que la «drogue provoque le crime». The socio-political framework of drugs in Portugal is that of a specialised «field», legitimised through an absolute prohibition. This article analyses the results of an investigation on the social representations of drugs as seen by parish-priests and doctors, subsequently relating them to the way in which political agents and doctors symbolically formulate the prohibition. The latter is presented in three cognitive plans, all critically analysed: (a) the semantic space in which~<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport qu'entretiennent histoire et mémoire à l'école est complexe et ambigu. Jusqu'aux années quatrevingt-dix, il a surtout été posé comme la relation, légitimée ou dénoncée, entre savoirs historiques, histoire scolaire et mémoire nationale. Dès les années soixante, le débat prend en compte le rapport entre le récit national et des histoires régionalistes qui revendiquent une place dans la culture scolaire, au nom des identités et du droit au passé. Cette dernière acception prévaut largement à l'heure actuelle mais cette fois au nom des minorités dépossédées de leur histoire, dès lors qu'elle n'a pas d'expression publique. Dans ces débats, la mémoire serait la forme d'une histoire parallèle, occultée et clandestine ; de leur côté les historiens tendent à distinguer histoire et mémoire. L'histoire scolaire, elle, admet l'histoire mais non les mémoires comme savoir de référence légitime ; pourtant les commémorations et le « devoir de mémoire » s'y invitent de plus en plus fréquemment. De telles évolutions interrogent les composantes de la discipline scolaire : au premier chef les finalités et les contenus mais aussi les pratiques, inégalement connues dans ce domaine et, finalement, les apprentissages souvent plus espérés qu'avérés. The connection that exists at school between history and memory is complicated and ambiguous; it is source of debate and demands which recently intensified with public and political uses. School history accepts history but not memories as good legitimate reference. And yet commemoration ceremonies and the "duty to remember" are more and more in the schools. Such changes question the elements of that school subject: its purpose of building identity and citizenship, its contents and their changes, its teaching practices, not really evenly known in this field, and finally the learning that is more often wished for than actually delivered. La relación que mantienen historia y memoria en la Escuela es compleja y ambigua; alimenta debates y ~<br>

Abstract: The title of the essay refers to the famous statement in Foucaults introduction to his History of Madness where he writes that "we have to do justice to Freud". The problem, however, is that Foucault's philosophy does not seem to do justice to Freud. Foucault's use of Freud is ambiguous: sometimes he uses him for purely instrumental purposes (when reconstructing the history of madness and sexuality), but sometimes—for anthropological purposes signaling Freud's role in redefining our common humanity and particularly our relation to language, life and work. The author confronts Foucault's ambiguous reading of Freud with the equally ambiguous reading of Foucault by Derrida. Derrida discusses Foucault twice. Once in the essay Cogito and The History of Madness in which Derrida takes on Foucault's understanding of Descartes and his role in the exclusion of madness from the realm of reason. The second time—in his essay To Do Justice to Freud. Here Derrida disagrees with Foucault whether Freud managed to reestablish the body's communication with reason which Descartes destroyed.<br>

Abstract: La pratique de l'observation avec une caméra se développe de plus en plus lors des enquêtes ethnographiques. Or, l'observation filmée ne consiste pas tant à traduire en image ce que l'on observe, mais surtout à savoir être là – face à l'autre – afin d'observer en tant qu'on filme. Il s'agit donc d'une posture singulière que nous définirons par le terme d'observation filmante, de même que l'observation participante définit une certaine pratique ethnographique. Mais, l'acte de filmer radicalise le rapport au « terrain » : que signifie représenter une situation dite « réelle » ? Comment deux personnes peuvent-elles accepter la présence d'un tiers qui rend compte de leurs échanges alors que ce qui se dit n'est pas prévu pour être publiquement représenté ? À partir de ces interrogations, cet article examine les conditions de l'observation filmée dans la mesure où cette pratique relève d'une relation sociale spécifique entre filmant et filmé. The practice of observing with a camera is becoming ever more frequent in ethnological fieldwork. A filmed observation is not so much the work of turning what is being observed into an image but, more importantly, the job of knowing how to be present, facing others, while filming. This very special stance is defined by the phrase « filming observation », in line with participant observation, another ethnological practice. The action of filming radicalizes relations with the « field ». What does a portrayal of a real situation mean ? How do two persons accept the presence of a third party who is filming their exchanges whenever what is being said is not intended for public presentation ? These questions serve to examine the conditions for a « filming observation » insofar as this practice refers to a specific social relation between the one filming and those being filmed.<br>

Abstract: When conceived as the presence of the past, memory can be said to pervade the music of Maurice Ravel. The number and range of these acts of musical memory -including illeces modelled on the medieval ballade, the Renaissance chanson, the Baroque tombeau, the Classical sonatine and the Romantic poème, among others -seem at first glance to testify to a uncomplicated relation between past and present which, upon closer review, is revealed to be problematic. One of the most complex and captivating artistic testaments to what Andreas Huyssen has called 'twilight memory' -not only in Ravel's music, but in Western modernism as a whole - is the eighth and final waltz of his illano suite Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911). In this waltz, which Ravel entitled 'Éilllogue', the hope of making the past present is reborn with each of its numerous thematic recollections, only to be dashed repeatedly by the melancholy knowledge of its impossibility. In the present study, affinities between the Éilllogue's musical behaviours and philosophical accounts of memory by Bergson, Jankélévitch and Nora are explored, along with the compositional precedents established by Beethoven, Schumann, Debussy and others.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se analiza la relación biográfica que Octavio Paz establece con Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz en Las trampas de la fe. A través del caso concreto de esta biografía sobre la monja novohispana se aborda la discusión teórica sobre las condiciones de posibilidad de toda operación biográfica cuyo objetivo es establecer un pacto de veracidad. El artículo consta de dos partes, la primera se centra en la construcción de la figura y las acciones de Sor Juana a través de su vocación como intelectual; la segunda aborda la reflexión sobre el lugar de enunciación de Paz, que escribe Las trampas de la fe a partir de un lugar institucional que lo avala y al cual defiende, situado en un tiempo específico y un espacio determinado. This article investigates the biographical relation that Octavio Paz establishes with Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in Las trampas de la fe. Through the specific case of this novospanic nun's biography, the article proposes a reflection on the conditions that make possible the biographical operation, the aim of which is to make a veracity pact. The article is divided in two parts: the first one analyses Sor Juana's figure and actions through the construction of her intellectual vocation; the second part analyses Paz's institutional location, which backs up an defines his work as a major intellectual figure of Mexico's XXth Century.<br>

Abstract: John Blacking's suggestion that some music transcends its social function by creating worlds of virtual time opens the way to a deeper understanding of the ontology of music. For Blacking, "music that is for being" enhances human consciousness by heightening temporal experiences. Music's power to affect our consciousness of time stands at the heart of an ontology of music. By examining music s relation to limit experiences such as trance and ecstasy, in which time itself appears to be transcended, I intend to argue that music's mode of being is the ground of its social, cultural, and even spiritual efficacy.<br>

Abstract: En explicitant le concept linguistique de prédicat et en étendant sa portée, l'auteur introduit et définit celui de « prédicat somatique », responsable de l'expression du sensible dans le langage. Il en illustre la pertinence et en spécifie le contenu analytique à travers trois exemples. La reprise critique de l'analyse du « sein nu » dans Palomar d'I. Calvino par A. J. Greimas (dans De l'imperfection) permet de dégager les propriétés du « corps percevant ». L'analyse d'un énoncé de la mère de Jamel Debbouze dans Télérama fait ressortir l'expression corporelle d'une vérité « refoulée, proscrite, par le langage », un « ça » vrai, expression d'un non-sujet immanent. Enfin, la relation fondamentale entre « l'acte politique » et « le corps parlant » est dégagée à partir de positions exprimées par Jean-Claude Milner et ici analysées dans la perspective du « prédicat somatique », dont trois variétés se trouvent ainsi dégagées au terme de l'article. Developing and extending the validity of the linguistic concept of predicate, the author introduces and defines the notion of "somatic predicate", responsible for expressing in language the experience of the senses. Three examples both show the notion's pertinence and specify its content. A critical reappraisal of A. J. Greimas' analysis of the « naked breast » in Italo Calvino's Palomar (in De l'imperfection) leads to defining me characteristics of the « perceiving body ». The analysis of an utterance of Jamel Debbouze's mother in Télérama stresses the physical, bodily expression of a truth "repressed, prohibited, by language", a true "id", the expression of an immanent non-subject. Finally, the fundamental relation between the "political act" and the "speaking body" is shown through opinions expressed by Jean-Claude Milner which are here analysed from the perspective of a "somatic predicate", three varieties of which have thus been described and defined by the end of the article.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Deslandes Ghislain<br>
Abstract: The analysis of narrative processes and metaphorical language are the topics generally focused on by business ethics researchers interested in the work of Paul Ricœur. Yet his work on political questions also applies to the ethical issues associated with organizations. Ricœur's ethical enterprise can be expressed as a triad composed of ideological, deontological, and sapiential levels, associating ostensibly opposing positions of Aristotelian and Kantian origin. In this study, I examine politics, economics, and ethics in their dialectic relation as established by Ricœur. Against a vertical, mechanistic, and axiologically neutral vision of management, he opposes the two conceptual pairs of conviction/imagination and ideology/utopia as well as a superior definition of justice associating reciprocal indebtedness and mutual disinterestedness. Through this analysis, it becomes clear that the vertical, hierarchical nature of politics tends to undermine the horizontal interactions necessary to procure just institutions in society. And any business ethic that does not acknowledge political tensions will be mute. What is needed instead is practical wisdom that is developed through interaction, and often through conflict, involving all the different players.<br>

Abstract: The issue — recently of renewed interest — seems one only within the western tradition : since when, and why? Philological study shows our modern differenciation between — and amalgation of — four kinds of relation between the text and the image in Antiquity, not all of which are ekphrasis. As heirs and inventors of this typology, we can trace from the Modern period both the complexities of its descendance and the permanence of its ideal.<br>

Author(s): de Mare Patrick<br>
Abstract: This paper presents a history of the large group approach in relation to Foulkesian group analytic psychotherapy, including the nature of this approach in relation to Foulkesian principles. Much of the theory reflects Foulkes's attitude, but there are also clear distinctions made, notably a new stance in our thinking about groups as a result of the increase in size (i.e., a membership of about 20), the introduction of the cultural dimension which this increase entails, and the question of what happens after the resolution of Kleinian, oedipal and familial conflicts has been achieved in psychoanalysis and small groups, notably what happens once "exile" has been achieved. The approach presented proposes to handle the frustration and hate that these conflicts engender in the form of negative or antilibidinal energies, and their transformation into psychic energy, through dialogue leading from hate to the establishment of koinonia, or impersonal fellowship, and of microcultural influences which promote rather than inhibit communication. Being neither small nor large, a group of about 20 members has become known as a "median" group.<br>

Abstract: This article challenges the assumption that "tradition" is a quality pertaining chiefly to objects, stylistic conventions, or the use of materials. Equally, it refutes the notion that tradition is merely the perpetuation of ritualized practices or skilled techniques. By considering the complex relation between vocational migration, heritage, and identity among contemporary fine woodworkers at London's Building Crafts College, it argues that tradition is a state of mind — a recurring nostalgia for an idealized past, or the desire for a Utopian future. More specifically, the article investigates a "tradition of longing" for engagement in nonalienating modes of production, aesthetic work, and an authentic way of living.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40084883<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Cochrane James R.<br>
Abstract: The essay refers to a concern for social justice in the origins of public health, borne in part by religious commitments, and to more recent expressions of a similar concern in debates about health equity. Equity, moreover, is affected by discursive power relations (dominant/hegemonic versus local/suppressed), which are discussed in relation to current research in the African Religious Health Assets Programme on the interaction of particular 'healthworlds' (a conceptual innovation) that shape the choices and behaviour of health-seekers. Two background theoretical positions guide the argument: Amartya Sen's claim that development is linked to freedom (including religious freedom); and, building on Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's human capabilities theory, an asset-based community approach to the building or reconstruction of public health systems. On this basis, it is argued that health systems and health interventions are just to the extent that they mediate between the necessary leadership or polity from 'above' (techné) and the experience and wisdom (métis) of those who are 'below', taking into account the asymmetries of power that this equation represents. Because difference and diversity are so often expressed in what we might reasonably call 'religious' terms, I specifically emphasize the continuing persistence of religion and, hence, the importance of accounting for its pertinence in social theory generally, and in relation to discourses of health and justice in the African context specifically. Acknowledging the ambiguities of religion, I nevertheless argue that an appreciative alignment between public health systems and religious or faith-based initiatives in health promotion, prevention and care is crucial to sustainable and just health systems in Africa.<br>

Abstract: Depois de apresentar a inseparável relação entre religião e cultura, com base numa abordagem hermenêutica da filosofia da religião, focaliza-se a questão no topos da relação entre religião e violência, com recurso às leitura de Girard, Ricœur e Marquard. Ao contrário do que muitas propostas defendem, considera-se o potencial do monoteísmo como superador de violência. Nesse contexto, o conceito cristão de Deus, baseado na originária articulação da identidade com a relação, é considerado como caminho religioso para a superação da violência - também no âmbito da relação inter-cultural. After presenting the inseparable relation between religion and culture from the perspective of a hermeneutics of the philosophy of religion, the article centres its attention on the relation between religion and violence, with special recourse made to Girard, Ricœur, and Marquard. Contrary to what has been often proposed, the essay advances the idea that monotheism has the potential of overcoming violence. In this context, the Christian concept of God, based on an original articulation of identity and relation, is conceived as the religious path to the overcoming of violence - also in the ambit of intercultural relation.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur vise à scruter le fondement de l'éthique en opposant la conception éthique de Paul Ricoeur à celle de deux de ses prédécesseurs, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. Il montre comment Ricœur a défini la notion de raison pratique qui se distingue radicalement de toute science, et comment il a développé son éthique sans vision de l'évolution biologique et anthropologique. Grâce à Aristote et en passant par Kant, il a montré, dans Soi-même comme un autre (1990), le rôle éthique de la narrativité dans la formation de l'identité personnelle et de la responsabilité. The author proposes an analysis of the foundation of ethics by opposing Paul Ricoeur's conception of ethics to that of two of his predecessors, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. He shows how Ricœur has defined the notion of practical reason as radically different from any science, and how he has developed his ethics in independence from considerations related to biological and anthropological evolution. In Oneself as Another (1990), on the basis of Aristotle and reformulated in relation to Kantian principles, he has demonstrated the role of ethics and narration in the formation of personal identity and responsibility.<br>

Abstract: La présente étude se consacre à un examen du concept de la mémoire collective en s'interrogeant sur l'interprétation que Paul Ricœur propose de ce concept dans son ouvrage La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. L'auteur présente une lecture critique de l'interprétation de la mémoire collective chez Ricœur là ou Ricœur tente de comprendre ce phénomène par analogie avec la mémoire personnelle et risque, selon cette lecture, d'occulter les dimensions de la mémoire collective qui échappent à un tel rapport analogique. L'auteur tente alors de dépasser le cadre de cette analogie par une analyse des sources symboliques et métapersonnelles de la mémoire collective. This study examines the concept of collective memory through an investigation of Paul Ricœur's interpretation of this concept in his work, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. In presenting a critical reading of the analogy Ricoeur establishes between collective and personal memory, the author argues that this analogy risks excluding those dimensions of collective memory which cannot be comprehended through such an analogy. The attempt is then made to surmount this difficulty through an analysis of collective memory in relation to its symbolic and metapersonal sources.<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion s'inscrit dans l'héritage de Paul Ricœur, à la recherche d'une philosophie de la traduction. Langage, langues, traduction entrant dans le jeu du processus de la constitution du sens, la traduction devient le moment privilégié d'une reconstruction de l'unité plurielle du discours humain et ouvre la voie à une éthique de l'hospitalité langagière et de la convivialité. Le don de la langue et des langues introduit un élément de gratuité qui corrige l'obsession contemporaine pour la marchandisation généralisée des mondes vitaux et laisse entrevoir un possible fondement non violent du lien social dans une perspective de solidarité et de sollicitude pour les personnes concrètes. Je propose d'établir une relation entre le don des langues en tant qu'élément constitutif de la communauté des parlants et la dette de l'hospitalité langagière impliquant une forme de responsabilité envers les autres à la fois spécifique et exemplaire. Au don gratuit de la langue et des langues qui nous permet d'accéder au monde et de nous rencontrer avec autrui, en réalisant entièrement nous-mêmes, correspond la dette d'exercer et de développer notre humanité dans le langage et à travers le langage. This study reflects on the philosophy of translation in light of the heritage of Paul Ricœur. Language, languages and translation all belong to the process of constitution of sense and here translation is of particular importance for the reconstitution of the plurality of human discourse in its unity and opens the way to an ethics of linguistic hospitality and sociability. The gift of language and of languages introduces an element of gratuity to correct the contemporary obsession with the general commercialization of the life world and suggests a possible non-violent foundation for the social bond in the perspective of solidarity and sollicitude for concrete persons. I propose to establish a relation between the gift of languages as a constitutive element of the community of speakers a~<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>

Author(s): Wilson Henrik<br>
Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Issue: i394183<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Theweleit Manfred<br>
Abstract: Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris" vividly embodies the problems surrounding the semantic status of fantastic utterances. It poses the problems as two related questions: what is the "objective" meaning of the notion of the Solarian ocean for the Solarist researchers in the novel, and what is the "symbolic" meaning of the novel's fantastic ocean for its readers. Since the diegetic planet Solaris has no objective relation to the meaning-producing dynamics of human work, the Solarian ocean is a projection of familiar human meanings. As for the fantastic ocean represented for the reader, it can be approached via several semantic interpretations, none of which are fully adequate. Three such approaches are the plasmatic, i.e., the different descriptions of the ocean are instances of the dominant metasemic lexeme "plasma"; the vaginal, i.e., the ocean is a displaced image of female sexuality; and the schizophrenic, i.e., the ocean is an instance of a schizophrenic "miraculation-machine" (derived from Deleuze-Guattari's Anti-Oedipus).<br>

Abstract: The three novels in English that won in the Centennial Literary Contest are very different in their approaches to imagining the nation. And yet, in some of the most important aspects of constructing a narrative of the nation, they stand in very much the same position in relation to its colonial experience. The importance of narratives in understanding current attitudes about the Philippine experience makes it imperative that these three valorized novels are studied closely and as a set.

Abstract: La coexistence de différentes manières de penser l'historicité - qu'elles soient, en particulier, cycliques ou linéaires - est évidente dans l'histoire longue de la Chine et, plus généralement, de l'Asie orientale. C'est ce que démontre l'article de Prasenjit Duara qui, après une réflexion sur les débats historiques et philosophiques portant sur le temps et l'histoire, insiste sur la manière dont les circulations transnationales affectent profondément les formes de l'historicité. Ici, c'est le rapport entre nation et conscience historique qui est examiné à nouveaux frais. Les récits du passé sont peut-être nécessaires à toutes les organisations sociales qui cherchent à se constituer comme telles. Cependant, avant l'apparition de l'Étatnation, ces récits non seulement englobaient des différences et des contestations, mais ils entretenaient aussi une relation à un temps et des idéaux universels ou cosmologiques. L'émergence de la modernité contribua au désenchantement du politique, parallèlement à l'avènement d'États capitalistes en concurrence, qui cherchèrent a mobiliser toutes les formes de ressources et de biopouvoir. Ces histoires de l'État et de la civilisation, linéaires et réifiées, furent essentielles dans cette mobilisation. Un bon exemple peut en être donné avec les récits historiques eurasiens et la manière dont ils circulèrent. Cet article les examine et s'intéresse notamment aux modalités de l'historicité en Asie orientale, en étant attentif à leurs circulations et en insistent sur les voies, à la fois globales et régionales, qu'elles empruntèrent. Leurs forces furent converties en récits historiques linéaires de nations souveraines engagées dans des interrelations de compétitions agressives. Narratives of the past are perhaps necessary in all collectivities that seek to constitute themselves as such. Before the modern nation-state, however, these narratives not only embedded differences and contestations, they also bore a relationship to universal or co~<br>

Article Title: Julius Nyerere à Zanzibar: Père ou ennemi de la nation ?<br>
Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i40105000<br>
Date: 6 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Fouéré Marie-Aude<br>
Abstract: Julius Nyerere a joué un rôle essentiel dans l'union de Zanzibar et de l'ancien Tanganyika, qui a formé la Tanzanie. Pére de la nation tanzanienne, son image est cependant toute différente chez les nationalistes de Zanzibar, qui en font un étranger et un adversaire. En dépliant ce discours nationaliste, Marie-Aude Fouéré brosse en creux et par petites touches le portait de Nyerere à Zanzibar et montre qu'un père de l'indépendance peut surtout être perçu comme un ennemi dans la périphérie d'un nouvel État. Un récit collectif dépréciatif sur le premier président de Tanzanie, Julius Nyerere, se difruse aujourd'hui dans les îles de Zanzibar. Au regard de la trajectoire mémorielle de Julius Nyerere en Tanzanie continentale, caractérisée par une constante surenchère de déférence, Zanzibar fait figure d'exception. L'article présente les termes de ce récit péjoratif sur Nyerere en rapport à deux épisodes centraux dans l'histoire des îles: la révolution de 1964, mythe de la nation zanzibarie libre et souveraine, et l'Union avec le Tanganyika. Il montre aussi comment ce récit dépréciatif entre en résonance avec la question musulmane qui, à Zanzibar, est consubstantielle à un positionnement identitaire collectif. L'article conclut que, dans une société sans père de la nation ni récit national unifié, Julius Nyerere constitue un récit de la nation en négatif. A derogatory collective narrative around the first President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, circulates in the islands of Zanzibar today. Against Nyerere's ever more deferential memorial trajectory in mainland Tanzania, Zanzibar stands out as an exception. This article presents the outline of this pejorative account of Nyerere in relation to two major events in the history of the Isles: the Revolution of 1964, myth of a free and sovereign Zanzibari nation; and the Union with Tanganyika. It also shows how this derogatory narrative is connected to the Muslim question which, in Zanzibar, amounts to a collective identity position~<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>

Author(s): Cochrane James R.<br>
Abstract: People think about health and illness in multifaceted ways, evidencing a conceptual complexity that corresponds to equally complex behaviours in relation to a diversity of healing practices. Stimulated by fieldwork in Lesotho and elsewhere, and engaging principally with Jürgen Habermas, we set out to introduce, explain and develop a conceptual innovation: healthworld. We argue that this notion describes and provides a key analytical tool for the field of health in its social context; a tool that can explain the empirical complexity of health beliefs (importantly, including religion) and behaviours, thereby illuminating possibilities for improving health practice and outcomes. Framed in relation to Habermas's notion of lifeworld, the healthworld is identified as a distinctive 'region' of the lifeworld defined by a particular telos – that of comprehensive well-being, a lifeworld without dysfunction.<br>

Article Title: Metaphor and the Subversive Process of Virginia Woolf's Essays<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113394<br>
Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Bishop Edward L.<br>
Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>

Author(s): Maloney J. Christopher<br>
Abstract: Metaphors are expressions in artificial, contrived, alien languages, and we understand metaphors by constructing translation schemes linking our natural, literal languages to these theoretically contrived metaphorical languages. The relation between a literal natural language and a metaphorical contrived language is like the relationship between a natively known language and a system of subsequently acquired languages etymologically emerging from that basic natural language. This model for understanding metaphorically contrived language is kin to the familiar model explaining how speakers of a language such as Latin may come to decipher a language like Spanish through projecting to Spanish what they know of Latin without the aid of a translation manual. A metaphor is, thus, seen as a sentence in a nonnatural language, itself derived from and at least partially translatable with the natural, literal language of the metaphor's author or audience. Les métaphores sont des expressions relevant de langues artificielles, construites, étrangères et nous les comprenons en construisant des schémas de traduction reliant notre langue naturelle littérale à ces langues métaphoriques théoriquement construites. La relation entre une langue naturelle littérale et une langue métaphorique construite est analogue à la relation entre une langue acquise primitivement et un système de langues apprises ensuite et qui dérivent étymologiquement de cette langue de base. Ce modèle, qui permet de comprendre un langage métaphorique construit, est apparenté au modèle familier expliquant comment les gens qui possèdent une langue telle que le latin arrivent à déchiffrer une langue telle que l'espagnol en projetant sur l'espagnol ce qu'ils savent du latin sans recourir à un dictionnaire. Une métaphore est donc considérée comme une phrase d'une langue non naturelle, dérivée elle-même de et au moins en partie traductible dans la langue naturelle littérale de l'auteur de la métaphore ou de ses lecteurs~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115286<br>
Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors. Das Zeichen als Ausdruck (Husserl) besteht nach F. de Saussure in der unmotivierten Beziehung Bezeichnendes-~<br>

Author(s): Della Seta Fabrizio<br>
Abstract: The analysis of an opera, understood as a dramatic text on which a plurality of texts converge, each generated by a different expressive code (be it verbal, musical, or visual), must first of all define a pertinent criterion by which the significant "actions" as discrete semantic units can be located in the text itself. Such a criterion can be identified within the principle at the basis of the dramatic genre, the interaction of the characters acting on stage and their changing relationships. On this basis, it is possible to read the action in Le Nozze di Figaro as the evolving system of dominance relationships between Count Almaviva and Figaro, and the various ways in which the other characters participate in this conflict. The same principle makes it possible to analyze a specific segment of the action (act II, scene VII-VIII, the second main section of the second finale), which can be broken down into a number of semantic units, along two hierarchically-organized structural levels. Earlier analyses have segmented this scene according to purely musical criteria, without considering its meaning for the overall unfolding of the drama. This new reading shows how the scene presents an important turning point in the plot, a temporary reversal of the relationship between the Count and the Countess. This turning point belongs specifically to the plot of the opera, which draws heavily on the text of the Beaumarchais comedy, but reformulates the syntax of the events; this shows how the "meaning" of a scene does not lie in the characters' dialogue alone, but that this is merely one of the possible devices by which the action is made to advance. As far as the role of the musical text is concerned, an analysis of its various components (form, motivic materials, tonal relationships, etc.) in the scene under consideration reveals that its role is primarily one of demarcation (it helps one to perceive the unity of a specific set of actions and its difference from the next set) a~<br>

Issue: i40117549<br>

Author(s): PETIT Jean-Luc<br>
Abstract: Au début des années 70 P. Ricœur travaillait à un rapprochement entre sémantique et herméneutique, projet qu'il n'a pas, semble-t-il, repris ultérieurement. Dans sa défense de la référence au monde contre les attaques des sémioticiens français, il était conduit à généraliser le rapport de référence à tout discours, y compris la poésie. Refusant autant le relativisme que le positivisme, il tentait d'unifier en une conception tensionnelle les termes des distinctions tranchées de la théorie classique. Dans cette perspective la logique du jugement accueille la créatitivé de la métaphore ; l'épistémologie des sciences reconnaît la valeur des modèles heuristiques ; et l'ontologie du discours s'adapte au pluralisme de notre rapport au monde à travers les œuvres littéraires. Tous ces déplacements d'accent devaient assurer une transition continue de la sémantique à l'herméneutique sans quitter le terrain du monde pour les abîmes de l'interprétation infinie. At the beginning of the seventies P. Ricœur was working upon the possibility of bringing together semantics and hermeneutics, although he did not, apparently, follow this line of concern thereafter. In his defense of the reference to the world against the French semiotician's attacks, he was driven to generalize the relation of reference to all kinds of discourse, poetry included. Rejecting relativism as much as positivism, he tried to unify in a tensional view the terms of the clear-cut distinctions of classical theory. From this point of view, the logic of judgement turns out to welcome the creativity of metaphor ; the epistemology of the sciences recognizes the worth of heuristic models ; and the ontology of discourse fits the pluralism of the relation to the world opened up to us by the literary works. All these shifts of emphasis were intended as securing a smooth transition from semantics to hermeneutics, without leaving the firm ground of the world for the depths of infinite interpretation.<br>

In this narrative is shown how, through several experiences (including at Dachau concentration camp) freedom is at work and transcends intellectual discussions in matters concerning the relation between freedom and law and also different conceptions about the meaning of life.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude consiste en une introduction en neuf étapes à la pensée du philosophe japonais Nishida Kitarô (1870-1945). Le néant nous livre des traces diffuses, que nous aimierions bien effacer à la lumière de l'être. Cependant, une fois appréhendé logiquement et approché phénoménologiquement, le néant révèle une structuration topologique remarquable, qui met en question les problématiques de la métaphysique et de la morale, en particulier concernant la distinction entre l'espace et le lieu, le vide et le plein et les rapports de l'un et du multiple. This essay is a nine steps introduction to the Japanese philosopher Nishida Kitaro's thought (1870-1945). Nothingness shows us some diffuse traces we would like to clear out with the light of being. However, once logically apprehended and phenomenologically approached, nothingness reveals a remarkable topological structure, which puts into the problems of metaphysics and moral, in particular concerning the distinction between space and place, fullness and void and the relation of the one and the many.<br>

Abstract: Aristote accorde une importance telle à la prudence qu'elle est le véritable lien de la politique et de l'éthique à travers toute sa philosophie de l'action. Pourtant, et à cause de cette importance, il ne peut guère la définir. Il ne la cerne pas par approximation comme une vertu morale ni par classification comme un régime politique. La prudence est la vertu intellectuelle, le concept imposé par le fait que la politique et l'éthique ne sont jamais entièrement liées et jamais entièrement déliées. La prudence machiavélienne radicalise cet enseignement; elle ne le rompt pas : là où la prudence aristotélicienne indique que politique et éthique ne peuvent être très séparées, l'habileté machiavélienne indique qu'elles ne peuvent être très liées. Ce n'est qu'avec Hobbes qu'on est en présence de la construction systématique d'une théorie dans laquelle la politique l'emporte entièrement sur l'éthique. Kant renverse cette priorité au seul profit de l'éthique. La recherche aristotélicienne fait finalement figure de moins mauvaise solution. Elle sort l'éthique du purisme et la politique de la pure force. En tout cas, sans référence à une relation entre la politique et l'éthique, la recherche de la prudence est peu probable. La croyance récente en la toute-puissance de l'histoire l'a montré. The importance which Aristotle sets on prudence makes it the real link between politics and ethics throughout his whole philosophy of action. Nevertheless, and because of this importance, he cannot define it. He does not approach it through approximation, as a moral virtue, nor by classification, as a political regime. Prudence is the intellectual virtue, the concept imposed by the fact that politics and ethics are never either entirely linked or entirely separate. Machiavellian prudence radicalizes this teaching, but does not upset it : whereas Aristotelian prudence indicates that politics and ethics cannot be widely separate, Machiavellian cunning indicates that they cannot be very close~<br>

Abstract: Cet article prend appui sur une enquête ethnographique de longue durée au sein d'un syndicat local de cheminots CFDT. Il s'inscrit dans une problématique constructiviste, envisageant la réalité sociale comme une construction historique et quotidienne des acteurs sociaux. Il tente plus précisément, dans ce cadre et à partir de matériaux empiriques, de réévaluer, à propos de l'univers syndical, les rapports entre connaissance savante et connaissance ordinaire ; d'où la notion d'epistemologie ordinaire du syndicalisme qui prend pour objet tout à la fois les sociologies des chercheurs professionnels et les sociologies mises en œuvre quotidiennement par les acteurs syndicaux. Il se démarque alors tant de la tradition de la rupture épistémologique entre travail scientifique et savoirs ordinaires que de la tendance à l'indifférenciation des pratiques savantes et ordinaires propre à l'ethnométhodologie. This article is based on a long range ethnographie survey within a CFDT local railway workers' union. It follows a constructivist problematics line, considering social reality as a daily and historical construction by social actors. More precisely, it attempts, within this framework and starting from empirical material, to reassess, in the trade union universe, the relation between scholarly and ordinary knowledge, which leads to the concept of an ordinary epistemology of trade unionism. The object of this is both the sociology of professional researchers and the sociology used daily by trade unionists. It is different both from the tradition of the epistemological break between scientific and ordinary knowledge and from the tendency to the indifferentiation of scholarly and ordinary practices proper to ethnomethodology.<br>

Abstract: Comme l'a montré Michel Foucault, la notion de responsabilité est consubstantielle de l'émergence de la figure de l'écrivain moderne. Cet article analyse les conditions historiques d'élaboration, en France, d'une éthique de la responsabilité fondatrice de l'engagement politique des écrivains en rapport avec la définition pénale de la responsabilité de l'auteur. Étayé sur une étude des débats parlementaires autour de la législation sur la liberté de presse, sur les procès d'écrivains de la Restauration à la Libération et sur leur réception dans la presse, il prend pour cadre de référence théorique l'approche sociologique plus générale de la responsabilité développée par Paul Fauconnet, notamment la distinction entre responsabilité objective et subjective, en l'appliquant aux crimes écrits. As Michel Foucault has argued, the notion of responsibility is a fundamental aspect of the emergence of the figure of the modern writer. This article analyzes the historical conditions for the development, in France, of an ethics of responsibility founding the political commitment of writers, in relation to the legal definition of auctorial responsibility. Based on a study of parliamentary debates on the freedom of the press, on literary trials from the Restauration till the Liberation, and on their reception in the newspapers, it draws, theoretically, on Paul Fauconnet's sociological approach of responsibility, namely the distinction between objective and subjective responsibility, applying it to written crimes.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the changing relationship between Balzac and theory from the 1970s onwards when Balzac was a favoured, if disparaged, object of theorization, as in Barthes s S/Z. More recent critics, however, see the multi-layered énunciations of/in his texts as evidence of their ability to theorize their own relationship to history, society, sexuality — and literature. In the same way, moreover, as texts such as Sarrasine and Une passion dans le désert critique their own relation to literature, ostensibly theoretical Balzac texts such as Une théorie de la démarche turn theory into a form of fiction. Whether moving from literature to theory or from theory to literature, Balzac — or 'Balzac'/Balzac — is thus shown to be (at) a nexus of literature, theory and literary theory.<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses the difficult relation between anthropology and history. The point, therefore, is to show how anthropology conceptualises the past differently from history as a discipline. Beginning with the differences between anthropology and history in terms of the concept of time, the article highlights that while for history time is concrete, objective and exogenous to human beings, for anthropology it is characterised by its being condensed, collectively subjective and endogenous. By analyzing actual examples, the article shows that the anthropologist is not interested in the past per se, but rather in the past as a dimension of the present. Accordingly, actualised, revised and manipulated history as well as the role of the past in the present need to be taken into account. Consequently, history and the past have their own specific efficiency because they are also a form of knowledge and social resource mobilised by single individuals or groups to find their bearings and act accordingly in the present and likewise to plan the future.<br>

Abstract: The ability of Christian discourse to give people a sense of their identity sustains the concrete church. The cultural revolt of the 1960s which suddenly weakened the power of discursive Christianity in Britain may be partially explained in terms of the deterritorializing power of capitalism. In the context of this deterritorialization the formation of self-identity becomes more difficult and strong religious identities have a new appeal. Post liberal theologians have endorsed the identity-forming power of the church. But Christian identity must still be worked out in relation to what lies beyond the borders of the church. Christians rediscover their own foundational story in the acts and deeds of others. Theological formation should involve not only an immersion in the Christian tradition but also the search for what recognisably shares in the same project that the gospel defines. The history of personalism suggests what this search might look like in practice.<br>

Abstract: Laying down as a theorical narratologic principle that history has never taken the shape of an actual experience, but was untili today a mere narrative representation, the author aims at following the evolution of the relation between literary shapes and historical past in the Polish literature after the Second World War. From 1945 onwards history does not appear any more as a kind of strategical staging; instead it becomes an attempt to live an immediate experience regardless of any intellectual reconstruction. Otherwise, instrumentalisation and ideological recovery of the past lead the Polish writers to a real denial of history thanks to (self) parodical literary forms. Finally the multiplication of autobiographical works means a new attack against the traditional historical novel. Thus, thanks to this triple strategy which leads to a dismantling of history consistent with the now prevailing bursting of narrative forms, Polish literature brings its own answer to the history crisis which is to be seen nowadays in the western literature.<br>

Abstract: L'expresivité phonologigue de la langue poétique tchèque Nous disposons aujourd'hui de preuves suffisantes pour croire au bien fondé du symbolisme phonétique véritable. Selon les oeuvres cités de Jakobson, Fónagy et Žuravlev on peut donc considérer comme acquis le fait que certaines significations sont naturellement attachées à certains sons et que tout phonème lorsqu'il est réalisé peut se charger de symbolisme par référence à isa nature articulatoire et acoustique. Le but de ce travail est de créer le point de départ objectif a l'interprétation phonostylistique du symbolisme phonétique des sons tchèques. L'auteur suit la doctrine de la méthode psychosémantique, il utilise la différentielle sémantique et présente a 40 sujets tchèques les phonème de leur langue maternelle. Jiráček prouve la validité de son approche par la confrontation des résultats parmi dix groupes des sujets tchèques a 40 personnes. Les résultats de l'ensemble de 400 sujets ont montré des facultés considérables des phonèmes tchèques pour l'expressivité phonologigue univoque. Ala fin de son étude l'auteur cherche d mettre en relation ses constatations scientifiques avec le domaine de la langue poétique tchèque. Il crée les points de départ a la comprehension automatique de la composition des sons du vers. Il donne naissance (en collaboration avec L. Popelinský) du programme automatique de cette analyse du vers et son fonctionnement présente sur la traduction du poème de Paul Verlaine.<br>

Abstract: Die Relation der Theologie zu den Naturwissenschaften ist ein besonderer Fall der Relation der Theologie zur Wissenschaft und ist durch die dynamischen Begriffe der Theologie, der Wissenschaft und der Naturwissenschaften bedingt und kann daher nicht ein fnr allemal bestimmt werden. Ich beschäftige mich hier mit der Situation der Begegnung der Theologie mit den Naturwissenschaften vom Standpunkt ihrer gegenseitigen Wahrheitsansprnche. Das große Fragenkomplex wird in mehreren Schritten analysiert.Nach einfahrenden und geschichtlichen Bemerkungen und Begriffsbestimmungen wird systematisch die Relation der Theologie zu den Naturwissenschaften und die diesbezügliche heutige Situation untersucht, wie auch die offizielle Stellung der Kirche (eine radikale Trennung von Theologie [Religion] und Wissenschaft hat immer Protest der katholischen Kirche hervorgerufen), die Motive fur den Dialog und die Integration und ihre Bedingungen dargestellt. Das Problem des Verhältnisses zwischen der Theologie (Religion) und den Wissenschaften ist typisch fur das Christentum und anderen Religionen eigentlich unbekannt. Die Kirchengeschichte liefert viele Beispiele direkten Konfliktes, in dem beide Seiten viele schwerwiegende Fehler begangen haben. So wie das Christentum auf bestimmten geschichtlichen Ereignissen (der Geburt, dem Tod und der Auferstehung Christi) aufbaut, so ist auch die Theologie an der Wahrheit ihrer Thesen interessiert. Schon im christlichen Altertum sind die klassischen und grundsatzlichen Positionen unter den Theologen entstanden: 1) einer radikalen Opposition und Verwerfung der Wissenschaft, 2) des Dialogs, der Versöhnung und gegenseitigen Ergänzung oder 3) der Gleichgültigkeit.Seitdem nimmt der Konflikt oft eine doppelte Gestalt an: eine institutionelle und eine doktrinäre (oder weltanschauliche). In Hinsicht auf den Charakter der doktrinären Konflikte und der Methode ihrer Losung muß man deutlich zwei Arten unterscheiden: den Konflikt zwischen den Glaubensartikeln (D~<br>

Abstract: This article with various models of relation between science and belief. The first part of paper discusses all theories which affirm an opposition between science and religious belief: some of the speak about a real and durable contradiction (logical empirism, marxism), another speak only about linguistic opposition (fideism, cryptofideism, theory of double truth). All these theories are controversial because they call in question the noetic value of religion or of science. The second part of the paper considers the theories affirming concordance between science and belief. They are following: the distinction of man's existential attitude toward religion and science (so-colled II. Wittgenstein), the theory of concordance, complementary character of science and belief, the theory of methodologie difference and of object's diversity. The author came do the conclusion that the best explication of the relation between science and religion is given by the synthetic-complementary theory.<br>

Abstract: Tamburlaine's insistence on making his audience see his sovereign power is a means by which he can organize and control alterity by fixing himself in specular relation to his objects. As the palpable reflections of his identity, Tamburlaine's sights of power produce effects of dramatic literalization by which he can maintain his unified and stable position as sole emperor: the play orders its field of vision by constructing an imaginary subject in fixed relation to its objects. The play, to the extent that it posits stable links between a subject and its images, and between signifiers and signifieds generally, creates a delusional space in which absolute sovereignty becomes possible. The effects of sovereignty, however, continue to define not only the theatrical space of the play, but the space of interpretation as well: critics have tried to account for the contest between aspiration and limitation in Tamburlaine by invoking concepts of theme, genre, character, and author in order to make sense of and therefore stabilize the play's conflicting gestures. Like Tamburlaine, the critic constructs an imaginary space by creating objects in relation to which he can confirm his own unity and power. Tamburlaine thus becomes a figure for the claims of sovereignty that mark all acts of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a contribution towards a more systematic consideration of the relation between recognition and autonomy in literary and cultural studies. The readings presented here rest on two premises: First, I assume that literary texts negotiate recognition in ways different from and not completely accessible to philosophy and the social sciences; and second, that the individualistic language of liberalism, which is preoccupied with autonomy and dependence, changes depending on how recognition is negotiated. Both Edward P. Jones's neo-slave narrative The Known World and Richard Powers's novel of ideas The Echo Maker stage historically and socially specific convergences of autonomy and dependence in their depictions of precarious subjectivity. The Known World, situated in the mid-nineteenth-century slave South, shows how the liberal ideal of self-mastery is implicitly linked to the mastery of others as chattel slaves. The Echo Maker, set in the early twenty-first-century Midwest, stages another form of precariousness that in some ways answers the questions of submission and self-mastery raised in the other novel. It suggests an at once more democratic and more literary model of individuality that does not depend on ownership so much as on the logic of storytelling. The novels project distinct diegetic worlds and rely on divergent generic patterns; in exploring the logics of possessive individualism and a more democratic model of storytelling respectively, they offer contingent concepts of agency that are dependent for their private and public stabilizations on very different forms of recognition of the other.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to explore the continuing relevance of Nietzsche's genealogical analysis of Western rationality to the sociology of knowledge. While Nietzsche is often neglected in classical sociological theory textbooks, this paper argues that Nietzsche has a very significant contribution to sociological theory especially in the field of knowledge production. Recent sociologists are now acknowledging this tradition. Hence this paper discusses how the basic tenets of Nietzsche's critique of Western metaphysics and positivism can be harnessed to create a powerful critique of contemporary sociological understanding of knowledge construction and its legitimation in society. Some of these themes are discussed at the end of the paper especially in relation to Philippine sociology.<br>

Abstract: This article critically examines the assumptions and processes involved in identifying histoncally distinctive plant identities by their Latin botanical names. By following latecolonial efforts to identify a medicinal herb mentioned in some versions of the Ramayana, this paper argues for a historicist analysis of the process of "retro-botanizing." In so doing, it also distinguishes between two different forms of "tradition," the "factualized" and "embedded." Finally, it blurs the allegedly watertight distinction between histoncal and mythic pasts. Instead of trying to distinguish these pasts ontologically, I argue that it is more productive to see specific pasts in relation to the sorts of futures they produce, that is, their respective historicities.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'« Archéologie », Thucydide met en oeuvre les modalités et les conséquences d'une omniprésence de la polis, en tant que phénomène social total, depuis les commencements, puis tout au long des « temps anciens (τά παλαιά) », et jusqu'au présent (νῦν). La description de ce passé antérieur est tantôt celle de l'état présocial ou de la genèse de l'état social de l'homme, tantôt celle des premiers temps des sociétés grecques, alors tournées vers le « développement » (αύξηθῆναι) et préoccupées de leur « puissance » (δύναμις). L'Archéologie entretient avec le présent une relation de distance et d'interférence. De distance, parce que le recours constant à l'expression τὰπαλαιά pour désigner ce moment marque une intention d'objectivation ; d'interférence, parce que les modèles d'intelligibilité élaborés par Thucydide tout au long de son exposé sont, par leur origine, empruntés au présent. Il montre que les concepts se sont forgés, sedimentes, complexifies au cours de cette forme de préhistoire. L'« Archéologie » décrit à la fois les temps anciens et le présent, le présent dans les temps anciens ; elle recourt à des concepts tirés du présent, mais validés parce qu'ils sont opératoires dans les temps des origines. In the «Archeolog», Thucydides brings into play the modalities and consequences of an omnipresence of the polis, as a total social phenomenon, since the origins, then all along the «former past» (ta palaia), to the present (nun). The description of that former past is sometimes that of a presocial state or of the genesis of man's social condition, sometimes that of the early days of Greek societies then bent on «development» (auxethenai) and concerned by their power (dynamis). The Archeology entertains with the present a relation of distance and interference. One of distance since the permanent resort to the expression ta palaia to designate that moment underscores an objectivying purpose; one of interference, since the patterns of intelligibility worked out ~<br>

Abstract: This paper is based on the analysis of a corpus of letters sent to a specific Chinese institution: the Letters and Visits Administration created in 1951. Its main focus is to analyze the recent trends of this particular space of direct address to State and Party representative. This is indeed a space where situations considered to be unjust, illegitimate, unacceptable are exposed, whether individually or collectively. The article begins by stressing the importance not only of the grievances expressed but of the type of relationship posited by complainants between themselves and those they appeal to, which is also between the ruled and the rulers. It then considers how letters and visits enable those who take such initiatives to step outside the private realm and tell public authorities who they are and, more precisely, how they perceive themselves. Finally, I will try to explain why the shared arguments put forward by petitioners, although they often rely on official commitments, cannot be understood as expressing a mere inclination towards rule compliance. Ce texte prend appui sur un corpus de lettres adressées à une institution chinoise particulière: l'administration des Lettres et des Visites créée en 1951. II a pour principal objectif d'analyser les développements récents de cet espace d'adresse directe auprès des représentants du Parti et de I'État. II s'agit en effet pour ceux qui investissent cet espace de parole, que ce soit à titre individuel ou collectif, de révéler des situations jugées injustes, illégitimes, inacceptables. L'article commence par souligner l'importance non seulement des griefs exprimés mais de la relation que les plaignants rendent manifeste dans leurs lettres entre eux et ceux auxquels ils s'adressent, soit entre gouvernés et gouvernants. II analyse ensuite comment lettres et visites permettent à ceux qui prennent de telles initiatives de sortir du domaine privé pour dire aux autorités publiques qui ils sont et, de façon plus précise, co~<br>

Abstract: Seeking to understand the manifest in relation to the implicit and the unstated-the unconscious of the conscious-this paper focuses on the elusiveness of social consciousness in a transitional colonial society with a rich heritage of its own. The issue chosen for examination is that of widow marriage and the period is confined to the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Progressively convulsing the upper caste, mainly middle class, Hindu society, the issue was one that epitomised the interplay of conflicting emotions, values and ideas that characterised men's consciousness about women during this seminal phase of Indian history.<br>

Abstract: A partir de una visión de la moneda que toma en cuenta su función simbólica primera —la de la representación de la totalidad social—, este artículo analiza la relación entre legitimidad política y el régimen monetario, puesta en escena por el paso de las altas inflaciones a la deflación en América Latina. En esta perspectiva se reconsideran los problemas de sustentabilidad de las políticas monetarias, y se establece que las mismas plantean más en América Latina que en Europa, el problema de la relación entre las soberanías política y monetaria. La interrogación se remite así al futuro posible del Mercosur: ¿se enredará en la discusión comercial o será motivo de emprender una deliberación política sobre la reorganización territorial y el marco institucional que sostendrían un crecimiento en economía abierta impulsado por el empleo y la demanda? On the basis of a view of currency that considers its initial symbolic function— that of the representation of social totality— the text analyzes the relationship between political legitimacy and monetary regime, caused by the shift from high inflation to deflation in Latin America. The problems of the sustainability of monetary policies are considered from this point of view, and the author suggests that, even more so in Latin America than in Europe, these policies raise the problem of the relationship between political and monetary sovereignty. The question leads one to the possible future of Mercosur: will it become enmeshed in trade discussions or will it lead to a political discussion on territorial reorganization and the institutional framework that would support growth in an open economy driven by employment and demand? À partir d'une vision de la monnaie qui prend en compte sa fonction symbolique première celle de la représentation de la totalité sociale, on analyse dans ce texte la relation entre légitimité politique et régime monétaire, relation mise en scène par le passage, en Amérique latine, de l'inflation galopan~<br>

Abstract: Since much of modern discourse, extending from cognitivism to connectionism, has been greatly inclined to look at human behavior in relation to processes where the subjective factor plays little if any causal role, it would not be inaccurate to say that the person has been left with but a trivial part to play in the overall script. The intent of this paper is to address this theoretical disproportionality by offering a more symmetrical account of creativity — one that reconsiders the reconstructive nature and generative capabilities of the person while not ignoring the contributions of technical and scientific thought.<br>

Author(s): TodorovAbstract: Rapidement, derrière la réclamation de la réparation morale des crimes contre l'humanité que constituent la traite négrière et l'esclavage dans les colonies françaises durant deux siècles, pointent des revendications de réparations matérielles de ces crimes. À l'inverse de ladite réparation, ces revendications paraissent n'avoir que très peu de possibilité d'être effectivement satisfaites et ne présenter qu'une faible légitimité à l'être. Et ce, principalement, parmi d'autres facteurs, du fait de l'éloignement dans le temps des crimes en question. C'est que s'il est vrai que bien des inégalités que connaissent les peuples des départements français d'Outre-mer portent encore la marque de l'oppression esclavagiste passée, il n'est pas moins certain qu'elles ne sont pas à combattre en fonction du passé, mais relativement a des dominations présentes. /// Quite soon, following in the tracks of a demand for a moral reparation of two centuries of slavery and slave trade in France's colonies, claims have been made for material reparations of these crimes against humanity. Unlike the first demand, these claims have very few chances of actually being satisfied and are apparently lacking in justification, mainly because, among others factors, these crimes lie in a distant past. Although many of the inequalities experienced by the inhabitants of the French overseas departments still bear the marks of slavery, it is no less true that the struggle against inequality is not to be led as a function of the past but, instead, in relation to present-day domination.<br>

Abstract: On semble considérer d'ordinaire que, dans les Travaux et les jours d'Hésiode, les deux grands mythes successifs de Prométhée et des races sont deux vieux mythes de même nature. On peut montrer pourtant que le mythe des races est en fait une sorte de révision critique du mythe de Prométhée, tout comme, dans la Bible, le premier récit de la Genèse doit être situé par rapport au deuxième, plus archaïque. Cette démarche comparative permet de voir dans le caractère créatif et critique de la pensée mythique une donnée anthropologique assez générale, longtemps minimisée par les approches structuralistes. The two great successive myths in Hesiod's Works and Days — the myth of Prometheus and the myth of Ages — are usually seen as two old myths of the same nature. However, it is possible to show that the myth of Ages is actually a kind of critical reassessment of the myth of Prometheus, just as in the Bible, the first narrative of Genesis must be placed in relation to the second one, which is more archaic. Thanks to this comparative proceeding, the creative and critical nature of mythical thought will appear as a fairly general anthropological fact, long minimized by the structuralist approach.<br>

Abstract: D'un côté, l'Enquête d'Hérodote rapporte les projets de domination qui, de Crésus à Xerxès, constituent la trame des rapports entre Grecs et Barbares, de 561 à 479. Mais, de l'autre, le lecteur ne peut oublier que de larges sections décrivent les coutumes et l'espace de nombreux peuples dès que la conquête les menace. Cette dynamique s'enracine dans les conditions matérielles de création et de lecture au Ve siècle avant J.-C, et dans les héritages narratifs que transforme Hérodote (Vies, Catalogues ...). Or aucun conquérant n'est glorifié ni présenté comme un vainqueur, tandis que les peuples visés opposent la singularité de leur espace et l'étrangeté de leurs coutumes, soit un genre de vie devenu stratégie de résistance, en associant particularisme insulaire et fuite calculée sur le modèle nomade. Les Grecs, de même, tantôt conquérants insatiables mais défaits, tantôt résistants invaincus, contribuent à monter que, chez Hérodote, l'autre a le visage de celui qui résiste plutôt que du Barbare. Il s'agit donc bien d'une autre écriture du passé, qui sauve de l'oubli tous les peuples décrits, non les seuls hauts faits des Rois. Les mêmes images sont employées pour décrire la résistance insulaire des nomades, et pour dire le cheminement de l'écriture, ainsi en relation d'homologie avec son objet. On one hand, Herodotus' Inquiry reports the plan of domination which from Croesus to Xerxes composes the system of the relation between Greeks and Barbarians, from 561 to 479. But on the other hand, the reader cannot forget that large sections describe customs and many people's area when they are threatened by conquest. This discrepancy has its roots in the material conditions of creativity and reading in the fifth century B.C., and to the narrative forms available to Herodotus (Lives, Lists...). However, no conqueror was praised nor spoken of as a victor, while people shown opposed their individual space and their peculiar customs, that is to say a way of life set up as a stra~<br>

Date: 4 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): DeLoughrey Elizabeth M.<br>
Abstract: This article explores how the concept of ecosystem ecologies, one of the most influential models of systems thinking, was developed in relation to the radioactive aftermath of US nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Islands. Historian Richard Grove has demonstrated how tropical island colonies all over the globe served as vital laboratories and spaces of social, botanical, and industrial experiment in ways that informed modernity and the conservation movement. I propose a similar relationship between the militarized American island colonies of Micronesia and how their constitution as AEC laboratories contributed to both atomic modernity and the field of ecosystem ecology. This was enacted through metaphorical concepts of island isolation and distributed visually by Atomic Energy Commission films that upheld an aerial vision of the newly acquired atolls for an American audience. Finally, the myth of isolation is also at work in the ways in which Marshall Islanders exposed to nuclear fallout became human subjects for radiation experiments due to the idea of the biological isolate.<br>

Abstract: La pensée de Gabriel Marcel se présente essentiellement comme une ontologie de la relation intersubjective. Par la relecture des textes publiés dans Les hommes contre l'humain, cette étude vise à situer les enjeux éthiques de cette pensée lorsqu'elle exerce sa clairvoyance sur le terrain de la critique des idéologies, du jugement politique et de l'évaluation des formes «désenchantées» de notre culture. The thought of Gabriel Marcel presents itself as essentially an ontology of intersubjective relations. Through the rereading of texts published in Les hommes contre l'humain, this study aims to show what is at stake ethically when these ideas are used to clarify the critique of ideologies, of political judgment, and of the evaluation of various forms of cultural "disillusionment".<br>

Abstract: La notion de tolérance est problématique: je m'efforce de le montrer en considérant tout d'abord les critiques dont elle est ou a été la cible. Puis, en partant de la conception de Locke, je relève les dilemmes qui peuvent surgir de la mise en pratique de la tolérance et la nécessité, mais aussi la difficulté, de fixer les limites de son application. Corollaire de la liberté de pensée et de l'acceptation du pluralisme, la tolérance est décrite, en dernier lieu, comme mise à l'épreuve purificatrice de nos convictions et comme instauratrice d'une véritable relation de réciprocité dans la mesure où elle parvient à dépasser le simple acquiescement à la diversité. The concept of tolerance is problematic : this I try to show first by considering the criticisms made of it. Then, starting with the perception of Locke, I point out the potential dilemmas of practising tolerance and the need, as well as the difficulty, of fixing limits to tolerance. A corollary to the freedom of thought and the approbation of pluralism, tolerance is finally described as the refining proof of conviction and the instigator of true reciprocity to the degree that it goes beyond the simple acquiescence of diversity.<br>

Ricœur entre les savoirs objectifs et la phénoménologie dans la description des rapports de la nature et de la liberté. Cette conversation dessine une mise en relation originale entre l'existence corporelle et la Transcendance; elle invite à reconnaître dans la corporéité le lieu d'incarnation d'une confiance primordiale. In the context of current research on the body, this articles underlines the rich dialogue begun by P. Ricœur between the objective sciences and phenomenology on the connection between nature and freedom. This dialogue establishes an original link between corporal existence and transcendence; it invites us to see corporality as the incarnation of a primordial trust.<br>

Abstract: Tout porte à croire qu'une langue «exotique» donne naissance également à des métaphores exotiques, qui conditionnent à leur tour des modes de penser différents des nôtres. L'analyse comparée d'un champ métaphorique commun à la Grèce et à la Chine (la lumière et le miroir) montre que les différences philosophiques ne procèdent pas de la diversité matérielle des métaphores utilisées, mais bien plutôt d'attitudes différentes adoptées face au langage. L'hypothèse du relativisme linguistique, loin de pouvoir être infirmée ou confirmée à travers l'analyse comparée, apparaît elle-même comme étant déjà dépendante de la manière dont la pensée grecque et occidentale a conçu les rapports entre la pensée et le langage. Everything leads us to believe that an «exotic» language produces exotic metaphors, which in turn condition those modesof thought different from our own. Comparative analysis of a metaphorical field common to Greece and China (light and the mirror) shows that the philosophical differences do not proceeed from the various material of the metaphors used, but rather from the different attitudes to language. The hypothesis of linguistic relativism far from being either weakened or confirmed by this comparative analysis, appears itself to depend on the manner in which Greek and occidental thought conceived the relation of thought to language.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur esquisse la relation de l'utilitarisme et du christianisme sous l'angle triple des rapports entre le bien et le salut, le sacrifice et le sujet, la souffrance réduite ou affrontée. Le trépied ainsi proposé ne constitue pas une cage de fer, à laquelle toute comparaison et toute lecture devraient se soumettre ou se refuser, mais seulement une possible structure de dialogue et de débat, devant faciliter et fructifier l'interpellation réciproque de la morale utilitariste et de l'éthique chrétienne. The author sketches the link of utilitarianism and Christianity on three bases : the relation of goodness and faith ; of sacrifice and the individual, of suffering denied and suffering met. This three-legged stool is not an iron cage meant to be accepted or rejected by the reader, but only a possible framework for dialogue designed to allow the mutual questioning of utilitarian morals and Christian ethics.<br>

Abstract: Jean-Paul II, dans son encyclique Ut unum sint, situe l'œcuménisme dans une double relation ascendante et descendante: d'une part relation de l'homme à Dieu et d'autre part relation de l'homme au monde. Ces deux mouvements doivent passer par la grille critique de la vérité et de l'amour pour être efficients, ce qui correspond à la Révélation comme mouvement premier de Dieu vers l'homme. Ainsi, le dialogue œcuménique ne pourra éviter une réflexion sur le statut de la vérité et de l'amour dans leur gestion ecclésiale, réflexion menée à la lumière de la polarité christologico-pneumatologique. Symptomatiquement, la question du ministère papal montre les impasses actuelles et les ouvertures possibles. John-Paul II, in his encyclical Ut unum sint, situates ecumenism in a twofold relationship, ascending and descending: the relationship of humankind to God and of humankind to the world. To be dynamic, these two movements must pass through the critical grid of truth and love, which corresponds to revelation as the first movement of God to humans. Thus ecumenical dialogue cannot avoid a reflection of the status of truth and love in ecclesiastic management, in the light of Christo-pneumatological polarity. Symptomatically, the question of papal ministry shows existing dead ends and possible apertures.<br>

Or les débats actuels de la bioéthique ne permettent pas toujours d'identifier clairement la pertinence de cette question. Afin de parvenir à une reformulation crédible de la contribution de l'éthique théologique à la discussion publique, il importe d'interroger les différentes manières de comprendre la relation entre les catégories d'immanence et de transcendance. En dialogue critique avec H. Tristram Engelhardt, l'auteur balise les conditions fondamentales d'accès à une interprétation de Dieu comme mystère du monde et de l'existence et donc aussi comme horizon indépassable de toute éthique. Contrary to certain radical lay prejudices, the question of God is at the heart of ethics. Yet current debates on bioethics do not always help to clearly identify the pertinence of the question. To reformulate the contribution of theological ethics to public discussion in a credible way, we must examine the different ways of understanding the relationship between immanence and transcendance. In critical dialogue with H. Tristram Engelhardt, the author marks out the basic conditions to access an interpretation of God as mystery of the world and of existance, thus also as the impassable horizon of all ethics.<br>

Abstract: Nous montrons ici que le rejet de l'identité par Wittgenstein s'appuie sur la contestation du principe de causalité, doublé d'une conception pragmatique de la personne. Dans son rejet de la causalité la position de Wittgenstein ressemble fortement à celle de David Hume. Pour parvenir à une conception pragmatique de la personne on analysera l'usage linguistique et grammatical qui régit l'identité personnelle. Chez Wittgenstein le concept de personne se définit par rapport au contexte actionnel. Here we show that Wittgentstein's dismissal of identity is dependent on the disputing of the principle of causality, reinforced by a pragmatic concept of personhood. In his rejection of causality, the position of Wittgenstein resembles that of David Hume. In order to get to a pragmatic idea of personhood, linguistic and grammatical usage of the terms defining personal identity is analysed. For Wittgenstein, the idea of personhood is defined in relation to the actual context.<br>

Abstract: Pour décrire les moyens dont dispose l'individu pour se constituer en personne (partagée entre l'identité du caractère, l'idem, et le soi plus personnel et moral de l 'ipse), Paul Ricœur, dans Soi-même comme un autre (Paris, Seuil 1990), emprunte aux linguistes deux ensembles conceptuels: les références identifiantes (noms propres) et les actes d'autodésignation du je. Mais, par ce double biais, la pragmatique linguistique conduirait, selon lui, à une impasse, éludant finalement la question du qui? C'est oublier que, dans l'énonciation, le je lui-même acquiert une certaine épaisseur sémantique. Une poésie mimétique d'action comme la poésie lyrique grecque montre le rôle que peut jouer dans la constitution du moi une identité énonciative collective, qui inscrit d'emblée la dialectique entre l'idem et l'ipse dans le rapport avec les autres, sans référence ni métaphysique ni théologique. To describe the means the individual has for establishing personhood (between character identity, the idem, and the more personnel and moral self of the ipse), Paul Ricoeur, in Oneself as Another (English translation 1992), borrows two conceptual ensembles from linguistics: the identifying references (proper nouns) and the self-designating acts of the self. But, according to him, by taking this double bias, linguistic pragmatics leads to an impasse by finally eluding the question "who". This is to forget that in enunciation, the very self acquires a certain semantic depth. A mimetic poetry of action, like Greek lyrical poetry, shows the role that can be played in the constitution of the self by a collectively enunciated identity, which automatically sets the dialectic between the idem and the ipse in relation to others, without metaphysical or theological reference.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de Michel Henry aura été de «recueillir» et développer le côté affectif de la phénoménologie, que Husserl, dans un passage clé de ses Idées directrices, a délaissé au profit du côté intentionnel de la subjectivité — tout comme trois siècles plus tôt Descartes avait «recueilli» la subjectivité écartée par Galilée. Le texte qui suit compare le concept de soubassement, ou âme, chez Husserl avec celui de chair chez Michel Henry. On verra que les deux philosophes parlent d'une couche sensible, qu'on peut d'une certaine manière situer entre corps et esprit, de deux points de vue diamétralement opposés. Au-delà de l'opposition entre les deux philosophies, cette recherche mène à une interprétation topologique du rapport entre corps, âme et esprit, tel que suggéré par le terme husserlien de soubassement, et propose un éclairage différent de la notion henryenne d'auto-affection. Michel Henry's objective was to "pick up" and develop the emotional side of phenomenology, which Husserl, in a key passage in Ideas, left aside in favour of the intentional side of subjectivity — just as Descartes, three centuries earlier, "picked up" subjectivity left aside by Galileo. In this article, we compare the concept of the sub-basement, or soul, for Husserl, with that of the body for Michel Henry. We will see that both philosophers speak of a sensitive layer that can be situated in a certain manner between body and spirit, from two diametrically opposite points of view. Beyond the opposition of the two philosophies, this research leads to a topological interpretation of the relation between body, soul and spirit, as suggested by Husserl's term sub-basement, and proposes a different light on Henry's notion of self-affection.<br>

Abstract: La question des rapports entre éthique philosophique et éthique théologique est au cœur de la pensée de Friedrich Daniel Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposant une conception originale de la raison dans ses liens à la nature et à l'histoire, l'auteur des Discours et de la Foi chrétienne restructure l'éthique philosophique autour des notions de Biens, de vertus et de devoirs. Quels liens une telle vision de l'éthique entretient-elle avec l'interprétation théologique de thèmes comme le Royaume de Dieu, la rédemption, la justification par la foi et la sanctification ? La concentration téléologique sur les Biens (Güterlehre) et sur le Bien suprême est-elle à comprendre aussi en un sens théologique ? Et si oui, comment penser la relation entre la dogmatique, la dialectique et l'éthique, non seulement chez Schleiermacher, mais dans le contexte moderne et postmoderne qui est le nôtre ? The relation between philosophical and theological ethics is at the centre of the thought of F. D. Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposing an original conception of reason in its connection to nature and to history, the author of Discourses and of The Christian Faith restructures philosophical ethics around the notions of the Good, of virtues and of duties. What connection does such a vision of ethics have with the theological interpretation of themes like the Kingdom of god, redemption, justification by faith and sanctification? Can the teleological focus on the Good fGüterlehrej andón the supreme Good be also understood theologically? If yes, how should one think of the relation between dogmatics, dialectics and ethics, not only in Schleiermacher, but in the modern and postmodern context of our age?<br>

Author(s): Chalamet Christophe<br>
Abstract: Dans cette leçon inaugurale, l'auteur se penche sur l'Évangile, compris au sens large de «promesse», comme objet et comme source de subversion. Deux textes bibliques illustrent chacun de ces deux aspects : le livre de Job et la parabole matthéenne des ouvriers de la onzième heure (Mt 20, 1-16). Une troisième et dernière partie porte sur la relation entre révélation et mystère. Le style oral a été en partie conservé. In this inaugural lecture, delivered on September 24, 2012 at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Geneva, the author develops the theme of the Gospel — understood broadly as «promise» — as both the object and subject of subversion. Two biblical texts are taken as illustrations of these two aspects: the book of Job and Matthew's parable of the vineyard workers of the eleventh hour (Mt 20:1-16). A third and final part focuses on the relation between revelation and mystery. The original style of the lecture has been partly maintained.<br>

Abstract: Où situer le danger ? Qui court un risque et qui le fait courir à qui ? Il s'agit de présenter deux analyses inverses de la notion de danger. Leur originalité tient au fait qu'il ne semble pas y avoir pour elles d'équité ou de réciprocité dans le danger: la menace vient exclusivement d'un côté de la relation. Pour Hegel, c'est le moi qui est l'objet de menaces. L'auteur de ces menaces est toujours l'autre, celui que je ne suis pas, et c'est précisément son altérité qui en fait une puissance dont je peux craindre la violence. C'est pourquoi la vérité – et la sécurité – se trouve toujours du côté de la réduction de la transcendance de l'autre. Pour cette raison, Levinas affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre dans la philosophie de Hegel, absence qu'il analyse justement comme un danger: c'est l'autre qui court un risque, et la menace vient de moi. La menace n'émane plus de l'étrangeté de l'autre, mais au contraire de la suppression de cette étrangeté. Ce qu'il est à craindre est, pour Hegel, que l'autre mette la main sur moi, et, pour Levinas, que je mette la main sur l'autre. Where is the danger? Who is at risk and who is a menace to whom? This article presents two opposite analyses of the notion of danger. Their originality lies in the fact that there seems to be no fairness or reciprocity in danger: the threat comes exclusively from one side of the relationship. For Hegel, oneself is always the object of threats. The source of these threats is always the other person, the one I am not, and it is precisely the other's alterity which is a force whose violence I should fear. That is why truth - and security – are always to be found in reducing the transcendence of the other. For this reason, Levinas claims that there is not an other in the philosophy of Hegel, an absence which he analyses as a danger; it's the other who is at risk, and the threat comes from me. The threat no longer emanates from the strangeness of the other, but, on the contrary, from the suppression of this ~<br>

Abstract: La relation entre spiritualisme et philosophie réflexive peut donner lieu à deux lectures inverses : ou bien la méthode reflexive trouve son fondement dans la reconnaissance de la réalité de l'esprit, ou bien c'est la pratique réflexive qui autorise et au besoin contrôle la portée des affirmations spiritualistes. L'article se situe dans cette seconde lignée. La précession de l'être par l'être qui définit la condition de la conscience ne légitime aucune intuition de l'Absolu, mais bien une affirmation ontologique originaire. L'âme, c'est la passion d'intériorité de cette auto-affirmation manifestante. Quant à l'Esprit, troisième dimension de l'être, c'est un Advenir éthique qui n'est en acte qu'à travers le monde des êtres, dans la rencontre réflexive multilatérale des consciences. The relationship between spiritualism and philosophical reflexivity can be seen in one of two ways: either a recognition of the reality of the spirit gave rise to the reflexive concept, or the practice of reflexivity came first and widened the scope of spiritual affirmations, controlling them when necessary. The article favours the latter view. The ability of a being to form a judgment about itself, and thus create a conscience, does not justify any conclusion about an Absolute, being on the contrary one of the basic statements of ontology. The soul is the result of this active self-judgment emerging from its seclusion. As for the spirit, the third component of the being, this is an ethical by-product which only comes into play through the world of beings, in the multilateral reflexive meeting of consciences.<br>

Abstract: L'étude se propose de montrer le bien-fondé et la fécondité de l'herméneutique du témoignage en philosophie en interrogeant l'un des problèmes fondamentaux que pose cette pratique, celui du rapport entre singularité et universalité, et ce dans trois champs relevant de la littérature : la littérature au sens large, les mythes littéraires et la Bible. L'étude de la notion de témoignage et de ses déplacements sémantiques dans le témoignage littéraire est inspirée de la philosophie de Paul Ricœur. Les exemples analysés sont ceux du mythe de Faust et de la figure de Job. This study endeavours to show that the hermeneutics of witness in philosophy are indeed well grounded and fecund, by inquiring into one of the essential problems of this practice : that of the relation of the singular to the universal. Three areas relating to literature are broached : literature in a wide sense, myth literature, and the Bible. This study of the idea of witness and its semantic fluctuations in witness literature is inspired by Paul Ricceur's philosophy. The examples analysed here are the Faust myth and the character Job.<br>

Abstract: Cette brève contribution propose un repérage sommaire de la philosophie de Jean Nabert par rapport à quelques-uns des courants qui traversent le champ de la philosophie contemporaine. Pour ce faire, elle utilise un article de Nabert paru en 1957 dans l'Encyclopédie Française, dans lequel l'A. se livre à une caractérisation de sa philosophie au sein de la tradition française de la philosophie réflexive. The purpose of this short contribution is to get a summary view of Jean Nabert's philosophy in relation to some of the currents that mark contemporary philosophy. The basis for this contribution is an article that Nabert published in 1957 in the Encyclopédie Française in which the author describes his own philosophy within the frame of French tradition of reflexive philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Le jugement de valeur est étudié par Nabert dans les Éléments pour une éthique. Il se situe à l'articulation de la compréhension de soi, de l'affirmation originaire et de la régénération. Pensé comme expression d'un acte originaire et non comme participation à l'être, il permet de lier réflexion, création et pluralité. Cette perspective métaphysique, soutenue par une philosophie réflexive de la conscience, suscite une perspective critique par rapport aux théories substantialistes (Scheler, Spaemann) ou procédurales (Habermas, Renaut) de la valeur. Si la valeur est promotion d'existence, les prédicats négatifs donnent forme à l'acte de protestation contre le mal, l'injustifiable. Jean Nabert studies the judgment of value in his Éléments pour une éthique. He himself is situated at the crossroads of the comprehension of self, original affirmation, and regeneration. Seen as the expression of an originating act and not as a participation in being, it can tie together reflexion, creation and plurality. This metaphysical perspective sustained by a reflexive philosophy of conscience invites a critical perspective in relation to substantialist (Scheler, Spaemann) or procedural (Habermas, Renaut) theories of value. If value is promotion of existence, then negative predicates give form to the act of protest against evil, the unjustifiable.<br>

Abstract: Cette Note présente l'ouvrage de Christian Duquoc, intitulé L'unique Christ. La symphonie différée, en en suivant le déroulement et en se montrant particulièrement attentif à son apport christologique. L'approche ne se limite pas à la question de la médiation unique du Christ. Elle aborde aussi le rapport du Christ à l'histoire et au cosmos, le sens de la mission de l'Église, sa relation au judaïsme, la signification du salut et la façon de l'envisager dans le cadre d'une pluralité des religions. Au long de sa présentation, l'auteur de cette Note montre que la théologie développée dans cet ouvrage se trouvait déjà largement amorcée dans les précédents travaux de Duquoc. This Note introduces the work of Christian Duquoc, entitled L'unique Christ. La symphonie différée, surveying its development and paying particular attention to its Christological contribution. Its approach is not limited to the question of Christ's unique mediation. It takes up as well Christ's relation to history and to the cosmos, the meaning of the Church's mission, its relation to Judaism, its signification of salvation, and the way of envisaging it within the setting of a plurality of religions. During the course of his presentation, the author of this Note shows that the theology developed in this work was largely initiated in Duquoc's earlier works.<br>

Abstract: P. Ricœur établit une relation méthodologique entre l'épistémologie et la phénoménologie herméneutique, en considérant l'épistémologie comme une médiation entre la phénoménologie et l'herméneutique. Cette considération de l'épistémologie en tant que médiation est profondément liée à la notion spécifique de « texte » chez P. Ricœur. Cet article montre que même si la philosophie de Ricœur ne traite pas de l'épistémologie des sciences de la nature, celle-ci peut être approfondie par une phénoménologie herméneutique : la phénoménologie éclaire la naissance du réseau conceptuel d'une théorie; l'épistémologie éclaire sa structure intérieure; l'herméneutique éclaire son interprétation et la liaison avec la réalité physique. P. Ricœur establishes a methodological relationship between epistemology and hermeneutical phenomenology, considering epistemology as mediation between phenomenology and hermeneutics. Ricœur's consideration of epistemology as mediation is profoundly related to his specific notion of text. This paper shows that even if Ricœur's philosophy does not refer to the epistemology of natural sciences, the latter can be deepened by hermeneutical phenomenology : phenomenology clarifies the birth of a conceptual network of a theory; epistemology clarifies its internal structure; hermeneutics clarifies its interpretation and its relation with physical reality.<br>

Article Title: From Public Participation to Place-Based Resistance. Environmental Critique and Modes of Valuation in the Struggles against the Expansion of the Malpensa Airport<br>
Publisher: GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences<br>
Issue: i40185962<br>

Author(s): Centemeri Laura<br>
Abstract: Through an analysis of the 40-year history of conflicts triggered by the repeated attempts to expand the Malpensa airport in northern Italy, this paper seeks to show the heuristic strength of using the concept of modes of valuation of the environment to discuss the transformations of environmental critique over time in their relation to social change. I argue that, beyond empirical specifics, the trajectory witnessed in this case – from public participation to place-based resistance – reflects more generalized dynamics that can be found in many other conflicts over large infrastructural projects in contemporary Europe. The article is organized as follows: in the first section I briefly introduce the concept of modes of valuation of the environment, which is inspired by recent work in pragmatic sociology. In particular, I distinguish between universal, local, and emplaced modes of valuation. In the second and third sections I provide an analysis of the struggles against the Malpensa airport expansion from 1970 to 2014. Here, I distinguish three phases of mobilization, which I discuss in terms of the transformations that can be observed in the arguments that actors develop to fight or support the airport expansion. I argue that these transformations are articulated not only with changing action repertoires but also with evolving social and sociotechnical imaginarles that convey specific understandings of the environment as a matter of political concern. This analysis shows that, far from being simply a case of citizens' resistance to change, the mobilization against the Malpensa airport has contributed to producing the cultural basis of an increased collective reflexivity about the many values that the environment takes on among community members in the airport region. In the final section I discuss some hypotheses concerning what modes of valuation of the environment reveal about the emergence of a new radicalism in environmental struggles.<br>

Abstract: Anderson, the possibility for persons to experience themselves as members of
a national community also depended on a shift towards "empty, homogeneous" time, which was in
turn motivated through the growing popularity of the novel as a literary genre. Anderson argues that
the narrative structure of the novel rests on a yardstick of empty, homogeneous time, which is lin-
early progressing, divisible into an infinite number of abstract, equivalent units, and independent
from any particular locale. Disparate characters in a novel, who may be in different locations
and completely unaware of the presence of certain other characters, and their actions in the unfold-
ing plot can be placed in relation to each other by virtue of temporal simultaneity on such an axis of
empty, homogeneous time. This narrative and temporal structuring particular to the literary genre of
the novel provides an analogy to the way in which persons imagine themselves as progressing
through history together in a national community, knowing that they exist together with other
co-nationals in a synchronic cross-section of time (1991: 25-26)<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i405180<br>
Date: 9 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): van DongenAbstract: In this article, I consider narratives told within a clinical setting. I argue that personnel in a day center for people with acquired brain damage are constantly involved in narrating about the disabled participants. The negotiation of who the participant is, and foremost will be, is in constant negotiation in regard to issues of hope. I further argue that hope is a meaning-making process and, as such, it has been defined as crucially connected to time. Hope has been said to enable a connection between the present and the future, because action taken in the present could bring about (positive) change in the future. However, I show that hope, in relation to narratives told about people with severe disabilities that are considered "incurable," must be understood within a realm of narrative foreclosure. Time seems to have lost the openness of its horizon for these people, and a narrative that tells of immediacy rather than chronology is created, resulting in hope being established within the present.<br>

Article Title: Falstaff as Parodist and Perhaps Holy Fool<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219705<br>
Date: 1 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Sittler Roy<br>
Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Article Title:  أسطورة الخلق في شرق أفريقيا / The Myth of Creation in East Africa <br>
Publisher: American University in Cairo. Department of English and Comparative Literature<br>
Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Article Title: Freud, Psychoanalysis, and Sociology: Some Observations on the Sociological Analysis of the Individual<br>
Publisher: Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd. For the London School of Economics<br>
Issue: i224978<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Adorno Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227551<br>
Date: 3 1, 1933<br>
Author(s): Williamson Bradd<br>
Abstract: Cultural cognition is the product of two different sorts of meaning: (a) the (objective) semiotic organization of cultural texts or models, and (b) the (subjective) processes of meaning construction through which cultural symbols become available to consciousness as "experience." This article proposes a way to bridge these two kinds of meaning by considering how cultural knowledge is grounded in sensory experience. Several cognitive processes (schematization, synesthesia, secondary intersubjectivity) are proposed for linking the objectively available schemata found in cultural practices and the processes of meaning construction by which individuals appropriate symbols to consciousness. The nature of the relation between public symbols and individual experience is discussed in relation to a number of current issues in post-structuralist culture theory.<br>

Abstract: Van Roermund also rejects MacCormick's distinction between normative and
narrative coherence, an sees narrative coherence as the very principle of the relation
between facts and norms (case and decision), thereby relying on philosophical argu-
ments. Two citations are too nice to be left unquoted. 'Facts are, as Strawson put it
(1964), what statements, when true, state; they are not what statements are about...
i.e., they are not things or states or events, but the objectifiable contents of state-
ments'. 'This definition of"a fact" resembles...Goodman's famous phrase: "Facts are
little theories; and true theories are big facts"' (1988, at 160)

Gardant au fond de l'espoir, l'auteure conclut l'article en présentant le protocole d'appropriation culturelle recommandé par des universitaires autochtones lors de l'utilisation de savoirs autochtones par des personnes nonautochtones dans des contextes pédagogiques.<br>

Abstract: Résumé. L'un des principaux problèmes dans la controverse entourant le recensement détaillé concernait la relation entre la science et la politique. En analysant les arguments et les hypothèses sous-jacentes de quatre interventions influentes et exemplaires faites au nom de la science, cet article rend un constat normatif de cette relation. Il nuance les idéaux protecteurs de la science que les critiques ont invoqués et avance que de telles ressources conceptuelles sont nécessaires pour protéger la science d'un empiètement politique indu. Cependant, dans leur zèle à défendre les droits de la science, les critiques en ont réclamé plus que nécessaire, ce qui a occulté la dimension de la valeur des décisions politiques et n'a pas respecté le rôle de la politique en tant que point légitime de prise de décision sur les questions de valeur. Un constat normatif adéquat de la relation entre la science et la politique dans la politique gouvernementale doit non seulement protéger la science contre la politique, mais aussi la politique contre la science.<br>

                  . מקצת השאלות קשורות לחיבורה של הדרשה, כגון מועד כתיבתה (לפני הדרשה הדבורה או אחריה? סמוך לזמן שנישאה או זמן רב אחר כך?), זהות המחבר (הדרשן עצמו או מישהו מתלמידיו או משומעיו?), אחידות הזמן של הדרשה הכתובה (האם היא כולה דברים שנדרשו במעמד אחד, או שהיא אוסף של קטעי דרשות שנישאו בזמנים שונים ואף בשנים שונות?). שאלות אחרות נוגעות לדרשה כשיחה כתובה, כגון מה הן מטרות המחבר (סיכום, תיעוד או שחזור של הדרשה הדבורה, או הוראה לקוראים עתידיים? במקרה האחרון, הדרשה הכתובה עשויה להיות יצירה חדשה שהזיקה בינה לבין הדרשה הדבורה קלושה), לאיזה קהל כיוון המחבר את דבריו (קהל שומעיו מקרב החסידים או גם קוראים אחרים?), כיצד השפיע המעבר מהדרשה הדבורה, שנישאה ביידיש, לדרשה הכתובה בלשון הקודש על התוכן ועל המשמעות של הדברים? לעניין אחרון זה ראו:

Abstract: This paper emerges out of an ethnographic study conducted at the University of Cape Town that explored the dynamics of an intervention providing a ‘safe space’ for university staff to engage in alternative ways with South Africa's apartheid past, the university's institutional culture and with each other. This paper focuses on the social politics that arose between the intervention, its participants and imagined non-participants in relation to the university's ‘transformation’ vision. The interventionist intention was reworked by participants at a ground level into key symbols by which participants shaped the patterns of their behaviours and gave meaning to their experiences. Utilising Ortner's (1973) model for recognising and using key symbols, I argue that ‘transformation’ and ‘safe space’ are
         elaboratingsymbols in that they have conceptual and action elaborating power. These elaborating symbols operate in relay with a kind of logic that ‘crystallises commitment’ from participants to the intervention in an emotionally powerful and relatively undifferentiated manner. In so doing, they render the intervention a ‘summarising’ symbol capable of expressing what their experience means to them as an imagined community in relation to others.<br>

Abstract: This article treats Mexican
         retablos(devotional paintings) in relation to people's actions. Retablos serve as a basis for seeing, talking about, and interpreting events born from oppressive, modern conditions. Actions and artful representation indicate, respectively, proximity to reality, from near to far—a difference that outlines a space for aesthetic production. I argue that retablos contribute to an aesthetic that orients the senses and the mind against oppressive conditions and toward a positive vision of what the world might be.<br>

Abstract: Hayes frequently uses recombination and assiduously designed constraints to link his poems to those of African American women poets who have preceded him. In
         Hip Logic, he includes as an epigraph a poem “made up of whole and partial lines in the index (underW) ofThe Collected Poems of.”audre lorde
            
               The collection also includes a sonnet entirely made up of the line “We sliced the watermelon into smiles” repeated fourteen times, and several odes. The bulk of the book is made up of a series of poems titled “A Gram of &S,” based on the daily word game found in the puzzle section of newspapers. Hayes explains in a note, “I end each line with one of the eleven words derived from the title word, while abiding by the other rules of the game: 1. Words must be derived from four or more letters. 2. Words that acquire four letters by the addition of ‘s,’ such as ‘bats’ or ‘dies’ are not used. 3. Only one form of a verb is used.”91
            
               In a more recent collection titled92
            Lighthead, Hayes also uses constraints. Reading just the end words of “The Golden Shovel” inLightheadgives the entirety of Gwendolyn Brooks's poem “We Real Cool”:
               
            When I am so small Da's sock covers my arm, we
               Cruise at twilight until we find the place the real
            
               Brooks's poem has been literally re-authored, as has Elizabeth Alexander's “Ladders,” which emerges in the end words of Hayes' poem “The Last Train to Africa”Men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.

This incorporation of the precursor is more thoroughgoing than an onomastic reference or dedication: it literally reproduces the precursor poem. As Hayes's new poem circulates, Brooks's ~<br>

Abstract: Another change is that the second part of the novel is more inclined to use close-ups rather than the inclusive seductive tracking, or “zooming” shots of the first part, thus entering into a more psychological tensional discourse. When Nick finds Gatsby in the pool, the camera eye does not change focal lengths from long shot to close-up in order to create a sense of awe, but instead moves closely between certain symbols:
         
               The emotional response to this stylistic close-up technique differs radically from the one of motion that worked so inclusively in the first part. Since Gatsby lies dead in the pool, there is no mystery anymore. The movement of the camera eye from one image to another slows down the duration of the scene drastically. Fitzgerald's literary technique “resembles filmmakers’ metaphorical use of the moving camera as a consumer of time,” Kundu suggests. This implies that Gatsby “is a victim not only of his impossible dream, but also of time's cruel prodigality, indeed, of the tragic flux and mutability of life itself” (Kundu 42). It also contradicts the novel's relation to movement in general; Berman describes the motion of the leaves as “moving, but going nowhere” (44).There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water. (162)<br>

Abstract: Remembering is a function of the meaning-making process after the emptiness of loss. Spelder and Strickland suggest that “grief is the emotional response to bereavement, to the event of loss” (as qtd. in DuBose, 368). The theologian Todd J. DuBose explains that “grief gazes at an ever-receding present as it moves further and further into the past. The immediate reaction often involves bargaining for a reversal of the loss, denial, anger, shock, anguish, distress, sadness” (368). These reactions are the body's means of trying to make sense of the world in the wake of the emptiness created by bereavement. Interpreting Drew Leder and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's notion of chiasmic structure of the body, DuBose explains that the body realizes its existence only in relation to other bodies. It touches because it is being touched. Other bodies make ours perceptible. The disappearance of these other bodies in death is, in tune with the chiasmic structure of bodily existence, the disappearance of our own bodies. We experience that disappearance as pain, grief, sorrow. These manifestations of pain are, indeed, the ways our bodies adjust to vacuum and fill it with meaning. For DuBose, “meaning-making processes, which
         appearto be immaterial processes, are embodied phenomena. Reflection, perception, feeling, language, even logic make sense only through the influx of the body's ‘reading’ of space, time, action, and sensation” (370).<br>

Abstract: In relation to these frustrating circumstances, however, I benefited in still another way from the early SPEP meetings. Had I been simply caught between my friends and teachers at Illinois and Northwestern, on the one hand, and the larger hostile culture of the philosophical mainstream, on the other, I might well have chosen a career of either speaking mostly to my own kind or becoming a professional critic. But in the diversity of those early meetings, I also found that it was hard to define just what “my own kind” was supposed to be. For me, an important fact about our theoretically underorganized little band is that we ourselves sometimes seemed only marginally better than the tradition at putting our passions into proper words. The difference, of course, is that many of us knew this. The fact that we continued to compromise our own efforts to be phenomenological simply encouraged us to be more phenomenological.<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Joining hyperbolic ethics with psychoanalysis, then, we might begin to forge ethics and politics in a necessary but tense relation, as the place where we find ourselves: this is our plight as social creatures living together with others. Navigating between Kant's too-easy unification of ethics and politics through universal moral law based on duty, on the one hand, and Levinas's radical separation of the two based on the singularity of infinite ethical repsonsiblity, on the other, let's say that social subjectivity is the thin membrane stretched between infinite ethical responsibility and finite political action. And its depth is the thickness of the flesh in embodied relations with others. Subjectivity is response to others and the environment that binds us to them, on the one hand; and agency is response to social historical situations, or subject positions, that binds us to the language and culture into which we are born—for better or worse—on the other (see Oliver
      2001,2004). Subjective agency is forged through this pledge or bond between politics and ethics made possible, even necessary, by our sociality; we are social embodied animals with fears and desires beyond our control, fears and desires that make love possible but also make hatred and cruelty realities that we cannot ignore. Our social subjectivity is that thin membrane and that thick embodied relationship with those around us, whether they are animal, vegetable, or mineral, human, beast, or machine—or more to the point here, whether they are friend or enemy, loved or hated, welcoming or threatening.<br>

Abstract: Paceboth Brentano and Chisholm, if the I is substance and the principle of individuation, we must steer clear of saying that the unique essence is what one has and, rather, hold that the unique essence is precisely what “I” refers to and it does not refer to a property of this referent. In this case the I-substance is self-individuating, that is,per seand not individuatedper accidensor by reason of being put in relation with another. Of course, we must keep separate the phenomenological-ontological distinctions that surface among “the ‘I’” (or “my I”) as material for eidetic analysis, what the indexical “I” brings to light, and what this indexical “I” pre-reflectively presupposes for its reference. In the latter two cases we do not need individuating markers; nor do we have to do with what/who has properties but, rather, with what/who is nonsortal and referred to nonascriptively.

Abstract: Second, there is a second revolution, even more radical and directly pertinent to both ethics and religion. But not only there. The concept of inverted intentionality, an intentionality of “a wholly different type,” requires a fundamental rethinking of the phenomenological method and project. We are not as far along on this, I think, as we are on coming to terms with the first revolution. More systematic work needs to be done in thinking through the transcendence, passivity, and heteronomy implied in being seen and being addressed. Perhaps Marion has pointed in the right direction in his answer to the question: Who comes after the (Cartesian) self (transcendental ego)? The self is
            l'interloqué (Angesprochene), the one addressed, called out, claimed.
                  The self is40
               l'adonné, the one gifted or given over. Our task is in large measure to think out the meaning of such names for the self and to come up with others equally illuminating. For ethics and religion always concern the question, Who am I?—in relation to that which transcends me.<br>

Abstract: Such vulnerability to assault raises questions of ethics that are central to the next section, entitled “Ethics and Reciprocity in Heidegger and Beauvoir.” Julie Kuhlken's article, “Heidegger and Aristotle: Action, Production, and Ethos,” considers Heidegger's practical philosophy, as expressed in his “Letter on Humanism,” in relation to his lectures on Aristotle from the 1920s. Through a discussion of Heidegger's distinctions between action and effecting and between ethics and ethos, Kuhlken argues that Heidegger's practical philosophy focuses less on ethics as it is typically understood today and more on the ancient notion of the good life. In “The Other (Woman): Limits of Knowledge in Beauvoir's Ethics of Reciprocity,” Ellie Anderson reassesses Beauvoir's ethics of reciprocity through a reading of her 1943 novel
      She Came to Stay. Anderson argues, against prominent readers of Beauvoir such as Penelope Deutscher and Debra Bergoffen, that central to Beauvoir's ethics is the recognition of the irreducible otherness or radical alterity of the other—and thus of a fundamental epistemic gap between self and other.<br>

Abstract: It seems to me that this provides the basis for a good answer to the question that was posed at the outset of this article, that is: “Is a hermeneutic phenomenology ‘wide open’ enough for a minimal phenomenology?” This is indeed the case. For, just as Freud's mixed discourse means that each discourse points to a discourse outside itself, the same could be said of the relation between Deleuze and phenomenology.
      
               The key here is to recognize that the nonsignifying or the impersonal is on the way to meaning and on the way to consciousness. And at the same time, phenomenological discourse necessarily points back to a nonsignifying or impersonal reality that precedes and gives rise to it. The role of a hermeneutic phenomenology is to mediate between these two discourses by traveling along this path back and forth between meaning and its becoming, following its composition and decomposition in the movement from sense to non-sense, from the impersonal to the personal, from the formless to form—and back again.26<br>

Abstract: Within this story, however, is also an errant subject. The wandering and wondering subject within the text—which is also to say beyond the text—who is “greatly astounded” (Mark 10:26) is left to wrestle with his or her subjectivity on a hermeneutical level and err toward an insight indicated through the disorienting hyperbole, for example, one's relation to God and to money as well as one's conception of the kingdom of God. Hyperbolic errancy, then, is not only a rhetorical strategy of exaggeration. To arrive at the truth by falsehood is also a mode of thought and an act of becoming, as noted by Genette and Bakhtin. The lie of hyperbole presents one with an opportunity to explore the hermeneutical possibilities for expanding one's conception of truth(s) beyond its conventional bounds.<br>

Abstract: In
         Time and Narrative, Ricoeur aligns the first stage of the hermeneutic circle, mimesis1, with the function of “prefiguration.” This concept describes the way in which narratives are “emplotted” according to “a preunderstanding of the world of action” (1984, 1:54). Ricoeur explains that preunderstanding has three primary features that affect the composition of a plot: meaningful structures, symbolic resources, and temporal character. The “meaningful structures” to which he refers can also be understood as a “conceptual network” of actions, people, events, stories, and the like. Just as words in a sentence constitute the level of semantic composition, the building blocks of activity in a narrative constitute a “semantics of action.” When writing of mimesis1, Ricoeur concentrates on the resources available within the context in which the text was produced rather than on describing how texts exhibit a semantics of action. It is in this cultural context that he locates the latent possibilities for emplotting action in a narrative. The “symbolic resources” are the ingredients of emplotment in a narrative, much as nouns, verbs, and objects are the ingredients of a sentence. Which types of resources are publicly available for representing human action? What are the various formulations for embedding human action in the unfolding of time? That is, what is the “temporal character” of narratives? How are human beings within a given cultural and historical context predisposed to understand the relation of human beings and human activities to time? How is time itself conceived in the society? Each of these elements—structures, symbols, and temporality—contributes to the prefiguration of the field of understanding wherein a narrative is emplotted (1984, 1:54–64).<br>

Abstract: The resonance of Shaw's perspectives on health deepens in his later writings, from
      Back to Methuselah(1921) andThe Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism(1928) toDoctors' Delusions(1932) andFarfetched Fables(1948–50). In them, with an eye toward collective wellness, progressive growth, and enduring fitness, he promulgates interrelated theories of metabiology, socialism, despotism, and evolution. His constellation of superabundant vitality, political and metaphysical sensibilities, and practices of diet, exercise, and dress evokes a Victorian construction of healthiness, understood, according to historian Bruce Haley, as “a state of constitutional growth and development in which the bodily systems and mental faculties interoperate harmoniously under the direct motive power of vital energy or the indirect motive power of the moral will, or both. Its signs are, subjectively recognized, a sense of wholeness and unencumbered capability, and, externally recognized, the production of useful, creative labor.”
            For many at the time,18
         mens sana in corpore sanoconceptualized the healthy body as a vivarium for intellectual and moral growth while others were more radically materialist in positing happiness and good living as dependent upon the physiological self. In any case, as Haley maintains, the “practice of analogically or metaphorically connecting [spiritual health and bodily health] was habitual in Victorian epistemology[,] … the ideal of personal health a way of grasping the proper relation between the self as a whole … and the unity of moral and physical laws which transcend the self.”
            If consistent with their yoking of vivacity, integrity, and volition, Shaw flipped the hierarchy that privileged the corporeal, figuring the intellectual will as the unifying and driving force in health; in his words, “it is the mind that makes the body and not the body the mind.”19

Abstract: For example, Shaw could agree with Schopenhauer that the world is fundamentally Will and simultaneously reject his metaphysics of unmitigated pessimism. He could concur with Nietzsche that the Judeo-Christian God is a deceased phantom and that institutionalized religion is a repressive force but still devoutly believe in a limited and liberating divine-like creative Life Force that suffuses the cosmos and drives evolution. He could also vehemently reject Darwin in favor of Lamarck on the grounds that the former banished not only mind but hope from the universe, leaving everything to fickle chance, whereas the latter accommodated will, purpose, and effort in mapping the descent of species. And he could agree with Marx that capitalism is a pestilence and deny both the determinism inherent in dialectical materialism as well as the implication that capitalists per se are wicked. In another register, he could denounce vaccines and vivisectionists and still lobby for something like a National Health Service, staffed by professionals dedicated to keeping the nation healthy through certified medical practices, in contradistinction to the unscrupulous charlatans of the day, who exploited human misery by peddling snake oil cures. Similarly, he could chide scientists for mistaking the relation of cause and effect but praise Einstein for his discovery of the curvilinear universe. He could likewise doubt the veracity of the Bible as literal truth but cherish the redemptive dimensions of its symbols, metaphors, and parables. In this connection, he could eschew the idea that Jesus died sacrificially on the cross to expiate our sins vicariously, only to rise from the dead three days later, and at the same affirm that the Nazarene embodied, in his teachings and actions, the best roadmap we have to earthly salvation. And perhaps most important of all, he could see the ubiquity of evil yet nevertheless maintain that it was a contingent rather than a necessary fact of life—more a produ~<br>

Abstract: The concept of fabula, or its many near equivalents, has always been a staple of narrative theory, yet it is vulnerable to many theoretical objections. It is possible to justify a rhetorical view of the concept's pragmatic value, and so its particular relevance to fiction, but only once various flawed notions of fabula have been eliminated. Some of these relate back quite directly to its Russian Formalist roots, but others have arisen through Structuralist mediations of the concept (in the guise of such pairs as “story” and “discourse”). The inadequacies of these models are manifest in fabula's relationship to event, chronology, temporality, causality, perspective, medium, and the genesis of narrative. The concept remains valuable, however, in respect of its role in interpretation, especially in the case of fictional narrative. The rhetorical basis of this view of fabula and its relation to sujet effectively overturns the logical hierarchy of previous representational models.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Marcuse's attitudes about utopia changed over the course of his career, and he remained ambivalent about the chance of realizing a utopian society. At the beginning of his career, his book
         Eros and Civilization(1955) defined utopia as the classic notion of an unachievable but desirable no-place outside of history, but by the end of his career, in his last book,The Aesthetic Dimension(1978), he had somewhat accepted Bloch's idea of the socialist “concrete utopia.” The emphases on quality and eros turn Marcuse's theory toward aesthetics, and as a result he favors arts and letters as vehicles for social change in the process of educating human desire. Clearly these are areas that touch on the function of rhetoric as well. Utopia for Marcuse is seen in relation to the progress of social change, and art's role is to keep alive the possibility of social and cultural transformation—the idea of utopia as a possible aim.
               In this way he resembles Bloch; both of them have a rhetorical role for utopian art and mediated productions of all kinds. However, Marcuse's utopia differs from Bloch's in that the present and the future are greatly separated, instead of one continually emerging from the other in an unfolding process. Utopia is a kind of natural, interpersonal eros that could sprout from the ashes of a formerly repressed society—something more chiastic than progressive, to use Mannheim's terms. In the meantime, false needs, such as those evoked through advertising, must be exposed, and true needs should be cultivated in their place. The work ethic would be replaced by a principle of receptivity and nonviolence (i.e., eros), and the highest value would be sufficiency rather than superabundance.28

Abstract: However, it is not so much that Joyce is denouncing his own project; it is more that he is inscribing his critics, allowing his refutations lease to disprove his work's position—giving them enough rope to let them bind themselves ineluctably within that position. The voices of artist and critic are bound up into a Joycean harmony of contradiction (in
         Finnegans Wakechaos finds itself harmonious): as Finn Fordham has suggested, “the relation between Shem and Shaun is like that between two parts of his own self: the visionary artist … and the revisionary critic who chides, reproaches, denigrates, and even slanders. There is an interchangeability in these inseparable twins.”
               The vision can only be realized through confrontation and reconciliation with its opposite. The Utopian and the anti-Utopian (which is not the dystopian but the critique of the Utopian essential for the realization of Utopia) bring each other into being. It is the dynamic friction between them that concretizes Utopian abstraction.130<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>

Abstract: As has been argued throughout this introduction, the complex relation between architecture and Utopia remains peculiarly undertheorized. In most conversations concerning the two,
         Utopiais, as has been suggested, shorthand for either escape or failure. The possibility that Utopia might actually offer insights into the prospect of a better world, by informing both theory and praxis, remains all but invisible within the discipline of architecture, except when confused with visionary fantasy projects destined to remain on paper or with audacious built works generally absent of a concern for architecture's fundamental social dimension.<br>
