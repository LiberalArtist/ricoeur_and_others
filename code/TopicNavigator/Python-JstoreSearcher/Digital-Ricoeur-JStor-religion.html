  Abstract: Fundamentalism has its roots in revivalism, but the Fundamentalist movement of the twentieth century has emerged as a radical reformulation of revivalist idealism. When Charles Finney addressed listeners and readers in his 1835
                  Lectures on Revivals of Religion, he warned of individual enemies that the revival church would have to confront and overcome in order to establish Christ’s kingdom on earth. He warned of “professors of religion” who would dismiss and speak against the work of revival. He warned often of a personal devil who conspired to keep sinners out of heaven. When he spoke against institutions and systems, however,<br>

  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Abstract: I have to apologize—being not a Girardian—when starting with an idea introduced in the text on “Violence and Religion: Cause or Effect?”: “The question of religious violence is first and foremost a human question, . . . and not a directly religious question” (Girard 2004).<br>

  Book Title: Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bubbio Paolo Diego<br>
  Abstract: Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxesis an account of Paolo Diego Bubbio's twenty-year intellectual journey through the twists and turns of Girard's mimetic theory. The author analyzes philosophy and religion as "enemy sisters" engaged in an endless competitive struggle and identifies the intellectual space where this rivalry can either be perpetuated or come to a paradoxical resolution. He goes on to explore topics ranging from arguments for the existence of God to mimetic theory's post-Kantian legacy, political implications, and capacity for identifying epochal phenomena, such as the crisis of the self, in popular culture. Bubbio concludes by advocating for an encounter between mimetic theory and contemporary philosophical hermeneutics-an encounter in which each approach benefits and is enriched by the resources of the other. The volume features a previously unpublished letter by René Girard on the relationship between philosophy and religion.<br>

  Abstract: In everyday language, the term “paradox” is used to refer to any claim or argument that contrasts with what is usually considered obvious. In a more specific and philosophical sense, a paradox is a claim or an argument that develops from apparently true premises and leads to a seemingly absurd (self-contradictory or logically unacceptable) conclusion. The term is also sometimes used in the context of religion to refer to a form of fideism professing a religious belief even when, or precisely because, that belief defies reason (as paradigmatically expressed by Tertullian’s
                  Credo quia absurdum). And then there is at least<br>

  Abstract: How can intimacy become a subject for critical reflection?¹ Intimacy is typically understood to focus on emotions of love and supportive family bonds. But if family life is the beginning point for reflection on intimacy, it is not the only terrain we can explore in an effort to understand it. Helpfully, Julia Kristeva both broadens and narrows the field for critical reflection on intimacy. She broadens it when she links intimacy to art, religion, and psychoanalysis and cites the unique capacity of these forms of cultural expression to
                  protect the singularity of human life.² Kristeva narrows the context for critical<br>

  Abstract: It is very difficult for an academic audience at the end of the twentieth century to imagine a time when the college preaching circuit was a way for theologians to influence large numbers of students and make a good income, or a time when listening to preaching was at least an occasional experience even for secular intellectuals. Religion remains an important legitimating device for the Republican Party and for what remains of the civil rights movement among African Americans, but religious symbols and themes—the sin of national pride, the tension between the

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Abstract: In his classic sociology textbook published in 1909, Charles Horton Cooley assessed the relationship between democracy and religion. ʺThe democratic movement,ʺ he wrote, ʺinsomuch as it feels a common spirit in all men, is of the same nature as Christianity; and it is said with truth that while the world was never so careless as now of the mechanism of religion, it was never so Christian in feeling.ʺ Comparing the ʺhigher spirit of democracyʺ to the ʺteaching of Jesus Christ,ʺ Cooley claimed that Jesus ʺcalls the mind out of the narrow and transient self of sensual appetites and visible appurtenances,<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Abstract: In 1944, from his prison cell at Tegel, Dietrich Bonhoeffer wondered whether Christianity had in fact outlived its usefulness as a religion.¹ His sentiments have been echoed in the subsequent half-century since, particularly with the rise of the postmodern climate. It would not be difficult to multiply logarithmically these critiques of Christianity. That there has been an expulsion of things Christian from the academy there is no doubt; more notably, it is paralleled in the expulsion of Jesus from the Christian churches.<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  Abstract: My analysis suggests that the distinctions social scientists make between empowerment and moral order, self-interest and morality, calculation and contemplation need to be rethought. Among Evangelical men in Caracas, religion does not begin with disinterest. It begins with dis-ease that is consciously and rationally addressed through religious practice. And this pragmatic quality does nothing to challenge its viability or its sincerity. The smiles and tears, courage and fear are all real. It would be a mistake to regard this as unique to Latin American Evangelicalism. I suspect any close review of empirical research on contemporary religious and cultural practices around<br>

  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Noddings Nel<br>
  Abstract: In this provocative new book, renowned educator and philosopher Nel Noddings extends her influential work on the ethics of care toward a compelling objective—global peace and justice. She asks: If we celebrate the success of women becoming more like men in professional life, should we not simultaneously hope that men become more like women—in caring for others, rejecting violence, and valuing the work of caring both publicly and personally? Drawing on current work on evolution, and bringing concrete examples from women’s lived experience to make a strong case for her position, Noddings answers this question by locating one source of morality in maternal instinct. She traces the development of the maternal instinct to natural caring and ethical caring, offering a preliminary sketch of what a care-driven concept of justice might look like. Finally, to advance the cause of caring, peace, and women’s advancement, Noddings urges women to abandon institutional, patriarchal religion and to seek their own paths to spirituality.<br>

  Author(s): Hasan-Rokem Galit<br>
  Abstract: In this lively and intellectually engaging book, Galit Hasan-Rokem shows that religion is shaped not only in the halls of theological disputation and institutions of divine study, but also in ordinary events of everyday life. Common aspects of human relations offer a major source for the symbols of religious texts and rituals of late antique Judaism as well as its partner in narrative dialogues, early Christianity, Hasan-Rokem argues. Focusing on the "neighborhood" of the Galilee that is the birthplace of many major religious and cultural developments, this book brings to life the riddles, parables, and folktales passed down in Rabbinic stories from the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era.<br>

  Abstract: The tales of the neighborhood that have been the focus of this book tell about the “neighborhood” of the Galilee in the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era. This neighborhood was at the time the birthing-ground for major religious and cultural formations that would prove consequential for many groups and peoples on a number of continents. Our entry into this milieu through the concept of a neighborhood has stressed small-scale processes, such as human relations and everyday life, rather than the major events of the period.

  Abstract: One of the critical issues in interreligious relations today is the connection, both actual and perceived, between sacred sources and the justification of violent acts as divinely mandated.
      Fighting Wordsmakes solid text-based scholarship accessible to the general public, beginning with the premise that a balanced approach to religious pluralism in our world must build on a measured, well-informed response to the increasingly publicized and sensationalized association of terrorism and large-scale violence with religion. In his introduction, Renard provides background on the major scriptures of seven religious traditions-Jewish, Christian (including both the Old and New Testaments), Islamic, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Sikh. Eight chapters then explore the interpretation of select facets of these scriptures, focusing on those texts so often claimed, both historically and more recently, as inspiration and justification for every kind of violence, from individual assassination to mass murder. With its nuanced consideration of a complex topic, this book is not merely about the religious sanctioning of violence but also about diverse ways of reading sacred textual sources.<br>

However, unlike for example the raging discussions over the Muslim pillar of faith known asjihād, scholars of the ancient Iranian religion named Zoroastrianism, after its founder Zarathushtra, have rarely broached the issues of just and unjust violence and of holy and sacrilegious war. Combat when examined both by the faith’s practitioners and by scholars is largely understood in terms of theodicy and eschatology linked to the human condition.<br>

The construction of doctrine in the broader Christian tradition and in systematic theology is a complex operation that involves many people over a great span of time with many disciplinary specialties and pastoral concerns.

  Book Title: Passage to the Center-Imagination and the Sacred in the Poetry of Seamus Heaney<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Tobin Daniel<br>
  Abstract: Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney, author of nine collections of poetry and three volumes of influential essays, is regarded by many as the greatest Irish poet since Yeats.
      Passage to the Centeris the most comprehensive critical treatment to date on Heaney's poetry and the first to study Heaney's body of work up toSeeing ThingsandThe Spirit Level. It is also the first to examine the poems from the perspective of religion, one of Heaney's guiding preoccupations. According to Tobin, the growth of Heaney's poetry may be charted through the recurrent figure of "the center," a key image in the relationship that evolved over time between the poet and his inherited place, an evolution that involved the continual re-evaluation and re-vision of imaginative boundaries. In a way that previous studies have not, Tobin's work examines Heaney's poetry in the context of modernist and postmodernist concerns about the desacralizing of civilization and provides a challenging engagement with the work of a living master.<br>

  Book Title: Material Spirit: Religion and Literature Intranscendent-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): GOOD CARL<br>
  Abstract: The essays in this collection examine philosophical, religious, and literary or artistic texts using methodologies and insights that have grown out of reflection on literature and art. In them, them phrase "material spirit" becomes a point of departure for considering the continuing spectral effects of religious texts and concerns in ways that do not simply call for, or assume, new orrenewed forms of religiosity. The writers in this collection seek to examine religion beyond traditional notions of transcendence: Their topics range from early Christian religious practices to global climate change. Some of the essays explore religious themes or tones in literary texts, for example, works by Wordsworth, Hopkins, Proust, Woolf, and Teresa of Avila. Others approach in a literarycritical mood philosophical or para-philosophical writers such as Bataille, Husserl, Derrida, and Benjamin. Still others treat writers of a more explicitly religious orientation, such as Augustine, Rosenzweig, or Bernard of Clairvaux.<br>

  Abstract: Today it is unusual to offer a comprehensive philosophical theory about the nature of human beings, or a theory about the origins of religion, or a theory of human culture in general. The French historian, literary critic, and philosopher René Girard (born 1923) has tried to do all of this with his mimetic theory. Though not a theologian, Girard has dealt in great detail with the biblical tradition—unusual for a secular social scientist. I will present one adoption of his theory into theological research: the “dramatic theology” that originated with the Swiss systematic theologian Raymund Schwager, S.J. (1935–2004),<br>

  Abstract: Overcoming Onto-theology is a stunning collection of essays by Merold Westphal, one of America's leading continental philosophers of religion, in which Westphal carefully explores the nature and the structure of a postmodern Christian philosophy. Written with characteristic clarity and charm, Westphal offers masterful studies of Heidegger's early lectures on Paul and Augustine, the idea of hermeneutics, Schleiermacher, Hegel, Derrida, and Nietzsche, all in the service of building his argument that postmodern thinking offers an indispensable tool for rethinking Christian faith. A must read for every student and professor of continental philosophy and the philosophy of religion, Overcoming Onto-theology is an invaluable collection that brings together in one place fourteen provocative and lucid essays by one of the most important thinkers working in American philosophy today.<br>

  Book Title: Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WOLFSON ELLIOT R.<br>
  Abstract: This long-awaited, magisterial study-an unparalleled blend of philosophy, poetry, and philology-draws on theories of sexuality, phenomenology, comparative religion, philological writings on Kabbalah, Russian formalism, Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, William Blake, and the very physics of the time-space continuum to establish what will surely be a highwater mark in work on Kabbalah. Not only a study of texts, Language, Eros, Being is perhaps the fullest confrontation of the body in Jewish studies, if not in religious studies as a whole.Elliot R. Wolfson explores the complex gender symbolism that permeates Kabbalistic literature. Focusing on the nexus of asceticism and eroticism, he seeks to define the role of symbolic and poetically charged language in the erotically configured visionary imagination of the medieval Kabbalists. He demonstrates that the traditional Kabbalistic view of gender was a monolithic and androcentric one, in which the feminine was conceived as being derived from the masculine. He does not shrink from the negative implications of this doctrine, but seeks to make an honest acknowledgment of it as the first step toward the redemption of an ancient wisdom.Comparisons with other mystical traditions-including those in Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam-are a remarkable feature throughout the book. They will make it important well beyond Jewish studies, indeed, a must for historians of comparative religion, in particular of comparative mysticism.Praise for Elliot R.

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

This complexity is particularly felt in the case of Tocqueville’s discussion of religion, a topic where he pursues several related or parallel questions: First, what is the common trait that characterizes all of the sects of American Christianity?

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality.

  Book Title: Saintly Influence: Edith Wyschogrod and the Possibilities of Philosophy of Religion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAVKA MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Since the publication of her first book, Emmanuel Levinas: The Problem of Ethical Metaphysics, in 1974-the first book about Levinas published in English-Edith Wyschogrod has been at the forefront of the fields of Continental philosophy and philosophy of religion. Her work has crossed many disciplinary boundaries, making peregrinations from phenomenology and moral philosophy to historiography, the history of religions (both Western and non-Western), aesthetics, and the philosophy of biology. In all of these discourses, she has sought to cultivate an awareness of how the self is situated and influenced, as well as the ways in which a self can influence others.In this volume, twelve scholars examine and display the influence of Wyschogrod's work in essays that take up the thematics of influence in a variety of contexts: Christian theology, the saintly behavior of the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon, the texts of the medieval Jewish mystic Abraham Abulafia, the philosophies of Levinas, Derrida, and Benjamin, the practice of intellectual history, the cultural memory of the New Testament, and pedagogy.In response, Wyschogrod shows how her interlocutors have brought to light her multiple authorial personae and have thus marked the ambiguity of selfhood, its position at the nexus of being influenced by and influencing others.<br>

  Book Title: Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of continental philosophy of religion by treating the thought of its most important representatives, including its appropriations by several thinkers in the United States. Part I provides context by examining religious aspects of the thought of Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Christina Gschwandtner contends that, although the work of these thinkers is not apologetic in nature (i.e., it does not provide an argument for religion, whether Christianity or Judaism), it prepares the ground for the more religiously motivated work of more recent thinkers by giving religious language and ideas some legitimacy in philosophical discussions. Part II devotes a chapter to each of the contemporary French thinkers who articulate a phenomenology of religious experience: Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. In it, the author argues that their respective philosophies can be read as an apologetics of sorts-namely, as arguments for the coherence of thought about God and the viability of religious experience-though each thinker does so in a different fashion and to a different degree. Part III considers the three major thinkers who have popularized and extended this phenomenology in the U.S. context: John D. Caputo, Merold Westphal, and Richard Kearney. The book thus both provides an introduction to important contemporary thinkers, many of whom have not yet received much treatment in English, and also argues that their philosophies can be read as providing an argument for Christian faith.<br>

  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib~<br>

Trained under Étienne Gilson, Davy had been hired as a lecturer in religion at the École des hautes études, and she had prepared to teach on the likeness (semblance) between the soul and God among the Cistercian monks of the twelfth century. About ten minutes into her presentation, three German officers walked into the auditorium, stood by the door, and stared at her. “I felt pale. My jaw tightened. All<br>

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton. He has edited Beyond Violence: Religious Sources for Social Transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Fordham).<br>

  Abstract: To receive the Marianist Award is a great honor. For the occasion I am asked to say something about the influence of my religious faith on my work, or about the interaction of one with the other. This is perhaps a straightforward assignment for a person whose work has been involved with the direction of public affairs. But it is less easy for an anthropologist, partly because it means delving into fairly intimate thoughts as you will see, and partly because of this particular religion, the Roman Catholic faith.<br>

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

  Abstract: Laïcité—the French version of secularism, which insists on the strict separation of church and state or, more generally, of politics and religion—has become well known internationally in the context of the March 2004 law prohibiting pupils at public schools from wearing “signes religieux ostensibles [conspicuous religious signs].”¹ Historically, however, it is important to view laïcité, in the context of the struggle between Catholicism and Republicanism during the first decades of the Third Republic (1870–1905). This contextualization will allow us to critique the use of laïcité, but also of secularism more generally, as a frame within which to<br>

  Book Title: Passing on the Faith: Transforming Traditions for the Next Generation of Jews, Christians, and Muslims-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Heft James L.<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, the Abrahamic faiths-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-have stressed the importance of transmitting religious identity from one generation to the next. Today, that sustaining mission has never been more challenged. Will young people have a faith to guide them? How can faith traditions anchor religious attachments in this secular, skeptical culture?The fruit of a historic gathering of scholars and religious leaders across three faiths and many disciplines, this important book reports on the religious lives of young people in today's world. It's also a unique inventory of creative and thoughtful responses from churches, synagogues, and mosques working to keep religion a significant force in those lives.The essays are grouped thematically. Opening the book, Melchor Sanchez de Toca and Nancy Ammerman explore fundamental issues that have an impact on religion-from the cultural effects of global consumerism and personal technology to pluralism and individualism. In Part Two, leading investigators present three leading studies of religiosity among young people and college students in the United States, illuminating the gap between personal values and organized religion-and the emergence of new, different forms of spirituality and faith. How religious institutions deal with these challenges forms the heart of the book-in portraits of best practicesdeveloped to revitalize traditional institutions, from a synagogue in New York City and a Muslim youth camp in California to the famed French Catholic community of the late Brother John of Taiz. Finally, Jack Miles and Diane Winston weave the findings into a broader perspective of the future of religious belief, practice, and feeling in a changing world.Filled with real-world wisdom, Passing the Faith will be an essential resource for anyone seeking to understand what religions must, and can, do to inspire a vigorous faith in the next generation.<br>

Within the life of any organized religion, those most exposed to secular institutions and most imbued with secular attitudes are likely to be young adults, some of whom will be making their way from the more or less religious homes of their youth into the larger culture in which they will make lives and homes of their own.

  Book Title: Building a Heaven on Earth-Religion, Activism, and Protest in Japanese Occupied Korea<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Park Albert L.<br>
  Abstract: Why and how did Korean religious groups respond to growing rural poverty, social dislocation, and the corrosion of culture caused by forces of modernization under strict Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945)? Questions about religion's relationship and response to capitalism, industrialization, urbanization, and secularization lie at the heart of understanding the intersection between colonialism, religion, and modernity in Korea. Yet, getting answers to these questions has been a challenge because of narrow historical investigations that fail to study religious processes in relation to political, economic, social, and cultural developments. In
      Building a Heaven on Earth, Albert L. Park studies the progressive drives by religious groups to contest standard conceptions of modernity and forge a heavenly kingdom on the Korean peninsula to relieve people from fierce ruptures in their everyday lives. The results of his study will reconfigure the debates on colonial modernity, the origins of faith-based social activism in Korea, and the role of religion in a modern world.<br>

  Book Title: The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Maas Sander<br>
  Abstract: Present-day music studies conspicuously evade the question of religion in contemporary music. Although many composers address the issue in their work, as yet there have been few attempts to think through the structure of religious music as we hear it. On the basis of a careful analysis of Olivier Messiaen's work, this book argues for a renewal of our thinking about religious music. Addressing his notion of a hyper-religiousmusic of sounds and colors, it aims to show that Messiaen has broken new ground. His reinvention of religious music makes us again aware of the fact that religious music, if taken in its proper radical sense, belongs to the foremost of musical adventures.The work of Olivier Messiaen is well known for its inclusion of religious themes and gestures. These alone, however, do not seem enough to account for the religious status of the work. Arguing for a breakthrough toward the beyondon the basis of the synaesthetic experience of music, Messiaen invites a confrontation with contemporary theologians and post-secular thinkers. How to account for a religious breakthrough that is produced by a work of art?Starting from an analysis of his 1960s oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur Jsus-Christ, this book arranges a moderated dialogue between Messiaen and the music theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the phenomenology of revelation of Jean-Luc Marion, the rethinking of religion and technics in Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, and the Augustinian ruminations of Sren Kierkegaard and Jean-Franois Lyotard. Ultimately, this confrontation underscores the challenging yet deeply affirmative nature of Messiaen's music.<br>

  Abstract: The varied and conflicting vocabularies Messiaen uses when speaking of his own work are a reflection of the complex cultural-historical background that informs it: secularization, individualization, modernism, postmodernism, and technology, to name a few. In the opening paragraph of his

He laments the fact that as a “Christian and a Roman Catholic,” he speaks of “God, Divine Mysteries, and the Mystery of Christ to unbelievers or people who have little knowledge of religion and theology.”¹ This sounds like<br>

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

But at least they could feed a large family and gradually build up some savings.

  Book Title: Douglas Coupland-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tate Andrew<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first full-length study of Douglas Coupland, one of the twenty-first century’s most innovative and influential novelists. The study explores the prolific first decade and a half of Coupland’s career, from Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture (1991) to JPod (2006), a period in which he published ten novels and four significant volumes of non-fiction. Emerging in the last decade of the twentieth century - amidst the absurd contradictions of instantaneous global communication and acute poverty - Coupland’s novels, short stories, essays and visual art have intervened in specifically contemporary debates regarding authenticity, artifice and art. This book explores Coupland’s response, in ground-breaking novels such as Microserfs, Girlfriend in a Coma and Miss Wyoming, to some of the most pressing issues of our times. Designed for students, researchers and general readers alike, the study is structured around thematically focused chapters that consider Coupland’s engagement with narrative, consumer culture, space, religion and ideas of the future.<br>

  for the love of God from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jb3s">The subject of love</a><br>
  Abstract: In an interview in 1996 with Hélène Cixous, Kathleen O’Grady broke something of a critical silence regarding the subject of Cixous’ relationship to religion. To the question of her personal relation to God, Cixous describes herself as ‘religiously atheistic’ (O’Grady, 1996–97). The statements that frame this disclosure, however, provide a context in which to read just what it is that she is implicitly distancing herself from and, more importantly, what it might be within religious discourses with which in practice she aligns herself.

  doing good in Africa from:

  Abstract: I discussed two ways of expressing and realising the idea of good in Chapter 3 – the transcendental and transformative – both of which have found expression in the imagination of Africa and Britain’s relationships and role there. Historically, these have been expressed directly in relation to religion. Wilberforce and Buxton explicitly tried to recapture a religious idea of the good and relate it to the British state: the ‘happy state of a truly Christian nation’ (Wilberforce, 1958: 119). Chamberlain and Lugard, neither of them religious men, made explicit references to the idea that a replacement for dwindling religious feeling<br>

  Book Title: Jesus the Central Jew-His Times and His People<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
  Abstract: In this book, LaCocque presents the case that Jesus was totally and unquestionably a Jew. He lived as a Jew, thought as a Jew, debated as a Jew, acted as a Jew and died as a Jew. He had no intention of creating a new religion; rather, he was a reformer of the Judaism of his day. True, his critique went far beyond an intellectual subversion. In fact, Jesus progressively thought of himself as the "Son of Man" inaugurating the advent of the Kingdom of God on earth.<br>

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Munro Martin<br>
  Abstract: In
         Tropical Apocalypse,Martin Munro argues that since the earliest days of European colonization, Caribbean-and especially Haitian-history has been shaped by apocalyptic events so that the region has, in effect, been living for centuries in an end time without end. By engaging with the contemporary apocalyptic turn in Caribbean studies and lived reality, he not only provides important historical contextualization for a general understanding of apocalypse in the region but also offers an account of the state of Haitian society and culture in the decades before the 2010 earthquake. Inherently interdisciplinary, his work ranges widely through Caribbean and Haitian thought, historiography, political discourse, literature, film, religion, and ecocriticism in its exploration of whether culture in these various forms can shape the future of a country.<br>

  Abstract: Was World War II a radical break in French Jewish history—a turning point in notions of community, identity, and political expression—or did the restoration of Jewish citizenship and the Fourth Republic’s promise to protect and defend all citizens regardless of religion or ethnic origin allow long-standing patterns of Jewish identification to reinstate themselves? This chapter will address this question by turning to an aspect of Jewish communal life that transcended the pre- and postwar years—that of how to integrate incoming Jewish refugees and immigrants into communal institutions and French society more broadly.

  Abstract: In the united states, at the mention of “religion,” what people often think of first is a moral code. We’re a pragmatic people; we’re practical people; we’re concerned about how to do things and how to act. In fact, pragmatism as a philosophy argues that theorizing follows action. Whereas classical Western wisdom stresses the thinking first and only thereupon the action that follows, Americans are very strong on action, and when it comes to defining religion, we tend to divide religions according to how they influence people’s behavior.

However important the Bible may be for Christians, it does not have the same status for them as the Tanak does for Judaism or the Koran for Islam.

In Part I the theme of uncertainty is considered against the background of fundamentalism and the accompanying lust for certainty; the impact of appeals to certainty with the rise of the modern sciences from the seventeenth century and the religious response; and<br>

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

  Abstract: Within the history of modern Jewish redemptive narratives, Bloch played a central role in translating what he interpreted as the subversive metahistory within religion into the praxis of horizontal solidarity and revolutionary agitation. Ernst Bloch’s great innovation was to infuse secular Marxist materialism with quasi-Kabbalistic mysticism and a metaphysics of contingency. This chapter is an exposition of those features within Bloch’s writings that contributed to the post–World War II creation of a “school of hope” among theologians and critical theorists.

  Abstract: What is the future of Continental philosophy of religion? These forward-looking essays address the new thinkers and movements that have gained prominence since the generation of Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, and Levinas and how they will reshape Continental philosophy of religion in the years to come. They look at the ways concepts such as liberation, sovereignty, and post-colonialism have engaged this new generation with political theology and the new pathways of thought that have opened in the wake of speculative realism and recent findings in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. Readers will discover new directions in this challenging and important area of philosophical inquiry.<br>

Some working within the Anglo-American strains of postmodernity have addressed and advanced post-Enlightenment thought in a remarkably successful manner, especially in regard to theology.¹ In this idiom, George Lindbeck is prominent among recent scholars using postmodern philosophy to help us imagine new ways of thinking about theology, particularly regarding the nature of religion, doctrine, and<br>

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

  Abstract: In a study of the Basseri pastoralists of southern Iran, Barth (1961) expresses some surprise regarding their lack of religious interest (they describe themselves as ‘slack Muslims’). His surprise is caused by the fact that religion seems to loom large in the lives of most of the peoples described in classic anthropological studies. This may be a major reason why religion has always been a central field of inquiry in anthropology, even if, as Evans-Pritchard (1962) once pointed out, social scientists have themselves often been indifferent or even hostile to religion.<br>

Thorough analyses of the genealogy of secularization, the political role of the apocalypse, the topology of the self, and the destruction of metaphysics demonstrate the continuous relevance of this highly subtle thinker.<br>

  Author(s): WHELAN YVONNE<br>
  Abstract: Ireland Beyond Boundaries provides an authoritative, up-to-date account of the development of Irish Studies over the past two decades. The fourteen contributors examine some of the key debates that have underpinned recent scholarship and analyse critical concerns that have shaped the subject’s remarkable growth. The book is divided into two parts. Part One traces the institutional fortunes of Irish Studies in Ireland, the USA, Canada, Australia and Britain. Part Two features in-depth critical accounts of specific trends and themes within Irish historiography, literary criticism, religion, migration, music, cultural geography, sport and media culture. Throughout the collection there is a recurring engagement with the role of interdisciplinary approaches within Irish Studies and its impact on teaching and research. Combining synoptic overviews with informed analyses, Ireland Beyond Boundaries is an essential text for all those working in the field.<br>

  Abstract: In his discussion on the best possible relationship between science and non-science (in which he included religion and the arts), Friedrich Nietzsche decided on the image of human beings having ‘a double brain’: a brain with two chambers lying next to one another, as it were, separable and self-contained, and experiencing different things without confusion (1994: 154). An experience of both science and non-science was necessary for human health, Nietzsche deemed, but at the same time the two had to be kept apart.

  Abstract: In religion, myth, legend, and above all in the arts there is an imaginary space populated with messengers: It is the world of angels, of placeless mediators between heaven and earth. The study of angels (‘angelology’¹) is an epiphenomenon of monotheism: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have added a more or less extensive army of angels to the statuary isolation of their God; the constitutional invisibility, unrepresentability, and remoteness of God is therefore supplemented with the offer of something holy that is visible, representable, and close, which takes on an allegorical form in angels.

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur was one of the leading French philosophers of the twentieth centuries. He was also one of the most erudite. From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: The Varieties of Transcendence traces American pragmatist thought on religion and its relevance for theorizing religion today. The volume establishes pragmatist concepts of religious individualization as powerful alternatives to the more common secularization discourse. In stressing the importance of Josiah Royce's work, it emphasizes religious individualism's compatibility with community. At the same time, by covering all of the major classical pragmatist theories of religion, it shows their kinship and common focus on the interrelation between the challenges of contingency and the semiotic significance of transcendence.<br>

  Abstract: By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Catholic Church faced serious challenges from competing ideologies, including Protestantism, liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism. These new ideas and actors posed a real threat to the Catholic Church’s privileges and moral influence in Latin America. Throughout the region, these challenges often took the form of debates over freedom of religion, the role of religion in state educational systems, civil marriage, and secular cemeteries. They were exacerbated by the proliferation of secular, and sometimes even overtly anti-Catholic, political parties.

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: Moses and Monotheism, Freud's last major book and the only one specifically devoted to a Jewish theme, has proved to be one of the most controversial and enigmatic works in the Freudian canon. Among other things, Freud claims in the book that Moses was an Egyptian, that he derived the notion of monotheism from Egyptian concepts, and that after he introduced monotheism to the Jews he was killed by them. Since these historical and ethnographic assumptions have been generally rejected by biblical scholars, anthropologists, and historians of religion, the book has increasingly been approached psychoanalytically, as a psychological document of Freud's inner life-of his allegedly unresolved Oedipal complex and ambivalence over his Jewish identity.<br>

  Book Title: Grace for the Injured Self-The Healing Approach of Heinz Kohut<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Randall Robert L.<br>
  Abstract: Grace for the Injured Self shows the reader how the 'self psychology' developed by Heinz Kohut can be an influential theory for pastoral care. The late Kohut affirmed that religion is not only an expression of the self, but can also sustain the self in the alliance between faith and grace, with self psychology and empathy. Cooper and Randall articulately explore Kohut's psychoanalytic perspective of 'self psychology', orientated towards pastoral care for parishioners. The authors ascertain how the human condition is affected by 'self injury', and the relationship between this and the traditional notions of sin. Two interviews with Kohut, never before published in the UK, give the reader unique insights into the psychoanalyst who many regard as the most important figure in psychology since Sigmund Freud.<br>

  Abstract: In this final chapter, we will respond to the previous interviews between Randall and Kohut, as well as offer some additional reflections on Kohut’s value for understanding the psychological functions of religion. While the entire chapter represents our combined and united work, we will respond individually to these issues. We believe this will provide the reader with a broader and more comprehensive analysis of Kohut’s potential as a dialogue partner with religion. Thus, Randall’s reflections will be followed by Cooper’s.<br>

  Book Title: The Scarlet Woman and the Red Hand-Evangelical Apocalyptic Belief in the Northern Ireland Troubles<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Searle Joshua T.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides a comprehensive description of how evangelicals in Northern Ireland interpreted the "Troubles" (1966-2007) in the light of how they read the Bible. The rich and diverse landscape of Northern Irish evangelicalism during the "Troubles" is ideally suited to this study of both the light and dark sides of apocalyptic eschatology. Searle demonstrates how the notion of apocalypse shaped evangelical and fundamentalist interpretations of the turbulent events that characterized this dark yet fascinating period in the history of Northern Ireland. The book uses this case study to offer a timely reflection on some of the most pressing issues in contemporary negotiations between culture and religion. Given the current resurgence of religious fundamentalism in the wake of 9/11, together with popular conceptions of a "clash of civilizations" and the so-called War on Terror, this book is not only an engaging academic study; it also resonates with some of the defining cultural issues of our time.<br>

The problem is partly attributable to the dominance of social science approaches, many of which are predicated on the dubious methodological premise that religious convictions and the language in which they assumed textual form can be understood through a proper grasp of the social contexts out of<br>

  Abstract: The three main authors discussed in this chapter – Feurbach, Marx and Freud – subscribe to the wishful-thinking school of atheism. They maintain that the fundamental purpose of religion is to make human life more bearable by making the suffering endured more understandable; and that the believer achieves this by projection: by transforming the natural human desires for protection and self-affirmation into the consolations provided by a benevolent deity. Each of them – and here we should also include Nietzsche – believed therefore that the religious consciousness was self-deceiving because the impulse to faith was in fact generated by powerful<br>

  Abstract: The premise of this collection is that “there is a ‘middle’ position between an exclusively religious and a strictly secular perspective” on economics. But it seems to me that a “middle position” must, by definition, compromise the truths of both religion and economics. Indeed, such a premise accepts what is one of the primary problems with modern economics, namely, the belief in the so-called “equity/efficiency” trade-off. That is, the belief that an economic system can be equitable or it can be efficient, but it cannot be both.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Embodiment-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nikkel David H.<br>
  Abstract: "Radical embodiment" refers to an anthropology and an epistemology fundamentally rooted in our bodies as always in correlation with our natural and social worlds. All human rationality, meaning, and value arise not only instrumentally but also substantively from this embodiment in the world. Radical embodiment reacts against Enlightenment mind-body dualism, as well as its monistic offshoots, including the physicalism that reduces everything to component matter-energy at the expense of subjectivity and meaning. It also rejects certain forms of postmodernism that reinscribe modern dualisms. David H. Nikkel develops the perspective of "radical embodiment" by examining varieties of modern and postmodern theology, and the nature and role of tradition-in terms of linguistic and non-linguistic experience, the religion and science dialogue on the nature of consciousness, and the immanent and transcendent aspects of God.<br>

  Abstract: The adjective “post-metaphysical,” often used in philosophical parlance to describe so-called postmodern construals of God, is ambiguous.

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Boscaljon Daniel<br>
  Abstract: At present the battle over who defines our future is being waged most publicly by secular and religious fundamentalists. 'Hope and the Longing for Utopia' offers an alternative position, disclosing a conceptual path toward potential worlds that resist a limited view of human potential and the gift of religion. In addition to outlining the value of embracing unknown potentialities, these twelve interdisciplinary essays explore why it has become crucial that we commit to hoping for values that resist traditional ideological commitments. Contextualized by contemporary writing on utopia, and drawing from a wealth of times and cultures ranging from Calvin’s Geneva to early twentieth-century Japanese children’s stories to Hollywood cinema, these essays cumulatively disclose the fundamental importance of resisting tantalizing certainties while considering the importance of the unknown and unknowable. Beginning with a set of four essays outlining the importance of hope and utopia as diagnostic concepts, and following with four concrete examples, the collection ends with a set of essays that provide theological speculations on the need to embrace finitude and limitations in a world increasingly enframed by secularizing impulses. Overall, this book discloses how hope and utopia illuminate ways to think past simplified wishes for the future.<br>

  Abstract: For centuries, the global understanding of Church has been shaped by Western theological imperatives. Yet today, the decline of institutional religion in the West, and the extraordinary growth of the Church of the global South mean that a radical movement beyond such theologies is required. In this book, Paul Matheny argues that the Church would benefit by becoming more contextualized and less Western. Contextual Theology is an attempt to address that issue and to examine how a reassessment of the relationship of the Gospel to cultural context can advance this critical and necessary development. Through an accessible and critical approach, Matheny considers the historical background to contextual theology. In the same way, he aims to show how to use contextual methods to think theologically and act missiologically in different cultural contexts.<br>

  Abstract: The twentieth century has been called a "century of horror". Proof of that, designation can be found in the vast and ever-increasing volume of scholarly work on violence, trauma, memory, and history across diverse academic disciplines. This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

  Book Title: Religion and Violence-A Dialectical Engagement through the Insights of Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Arcamone Dominic<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Religion and Violence is to engage dialectically key symbols of religiously motivated violence through the insights of Bernard Lonergan. Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

                  cosmopolis, sincecosmopolisis the symbolic name for the mediation of authentic meanings and values to aid progress or to meet decline. (2) The content question: If the<br>

  Abstract: No study of the role of religion in a small rural parish such as St-Joseph can proceed very far without looking at the place of the parish priest in the community. Surveyor General Joseph Bouchette observed in 1831 that the parish priests in Lower Canada were honoured members of their communities. They were, he said, “labourious in their duties, frugal in their living, decorous in their manners; possessed of much intelligence, and some learning, they are gentle, modest, and benevolent.”¹ Likewise, Lucien Lemieux found, in the period 1760–1840, that out of 700 priests who served in Québec only 60<br>

  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

Any attempt to understand the Anastenaria as a system of religious healing must therefore integrate approaches from medical anthropology with those from the anthropological study of religion. It must bring together the concerns of transcultural psychiatry and those of symbolic anthropology. Such a synthesis, which constitutes an interpretive or hermeneutic approach to the study of ritual therapy, provides the theoretical framework for this study of the Anastenaria.<br>

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

The trust in divine agency, they would say, is the only true determinant of a person’s fate, including his or her economic and material pursuits. However, the relationship between economy and religion is not such a simple story after all.

Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

Christianity and Islam acted similarly.

To some extent ritual is one of those phenomena that falls under the heading of “you know it when you see it.” Despite the absence of a definition—or perhaps because of the absence—ritual has drawn much attention from religious studies scholars, anthropologists, historians, sociologists, psychologists, and other experts. Perhaps this is because ritual is often the most visible manifestation of religion and the one that first<br>

  Abstract: From opposing ideological positions—familiarly translated as vitalist-theosophical on the one hand and orthodox Anglo-Catholic on the other—D. H. Lawrence and T. S. Eliot have been considered important in our modern tradition for their effort to reinstate some connection between religion and art in a literature aggressively shorn of religious thought. If we think of early twentieth-century writing as occasionally turning to some prescription for spiritual health, then we do think of Lawrence and Eliot. But what prescriptiveness there is—and it is perhaps less pronounced than criticism would have it—is not the affinity between these two writers<br>

  Book Title: The humanities and the Irish university-Anomalies and opportunities<br>

  Author(s): O’Sullivan Michael<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university. Ireland was a deeply religious country throughout the twentieth century but the colleges of its National University never established a religion or theology department. The official first language of Ireland is Irish but the vast majority of teaching in the arts and humanities is in English. These are two of the anomalies that long constrained humanities education in Ireland. This book charts a history of responses to humanities education in the Irish context. Reading the work of John Henry Newman, Padraig Pearse, Sean O Tuama, Denis Donoghue, Declan Kiberd, Richard Kearney and others, it looks for an Irish humanities ethos. It compares humanities models in the US, France and Asia with those in Ireland in light of work by Immanuel Kant, Pierre Bourdieu and Jacques Derrida. It should appeal to those interested in Irish education and history.The first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university<br>

As a reaction against mainstream classicism, Enlightenment rationalism, scientific objectivism, disenchantment, and attempts to crush religion, Romanticism¹ attempted to revive and liberate subjective feeling and emotion, passion, horror, and melancholy.

  Abstract: The prestige of the Enlightenment has declined in recent years. Many consider its thinking abstract, its art and poetry uninspiring, and the assertion that it introduced a new age of freedom and progress after centuries of darkness and superstition presumptuous. In this book, an eminent scholar of modern culture shows that the Enlightenment was a more complex phenomenon than most of its detractors and advocates assume. It includes rationalist as well as antirationalist tendencies, a critique of traditional morality and religion as well as an attempt to establish them on new foundations, even the beginning of a moral renewal and a spiritual revival.<br>

Some philosophers, such as Leibniz and Clarke, responded from within the rationalist tradition. Others, among them Malebranche, Berkeley, and Jacobi, considered philosophical rationalism the very source of the religious crisis and repudiated it altogether. The first group attempted to revive philosophical theology, a branch of metaphysics that had existed since the early Stoics and that aimed at establishing the existence and nature of God.

  Book Title: Absorbing Perfections-Kabbalah and Interpretation<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

Such people wrote about books in order to write about art, politics, religion, and the interaction of society and culture—in short, what men and women of letters have always brought to the table. Although the same can be said of current literary practitioners, something else can be said as well: Unlike those who interpret books today, earlier critics possessed an implicit belief in literature’s significance, not simply because literature espoused a point of view,<br>

  Book Title: The Operation of Grace-Further Essays on Art, Faith, and Mystery<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfe Gregory<br>
  Abstract: The Operation of Grace collects a decade’s worth of essays by Gregory Wolfe taken from the pages of Image, the literary journal he founded more than a quarter century ago. As he notes in the preface, his Image editorials, while they cover a wide range of topics, focus on the intersection of “art, faith, and mystery". Wolfe believes that art and religion, while hardly identical, offer illuminating analogies to one another—art deepening faith through the empathetic reach of the imagination and faith anchoring art in a vision beyond the artist’s ego. Several essays dwell on how aesthetic values like ambiguity, tragedy, and beauty enlarge our understanding of the spiritual life. There are also a series of reflections that extend Wolfe’s campaign to renew the neglected and often misunderstood tradition of Christian humanism. Finally, there are sections that contain more personal meditations arising from Wolfe’s involvement in nurturing and promoting the work of emerging writers and artists. The Operation of Grace demonstrates once again why novelist Ron Hansen has spoken of Wolfe as “one of the most incisive and persuasive voices of our generation".<br>

One can also, like Stevens, pit the claims of “nature” against the “supernatural”: “the great poems of heaven and hell have been written and the great poem of the earth remains to be written” (730).

  Abstract: Religious language, ideas, and images pervade the essays, plays, stories, and novels of James Baldwin. A product of Black Pentecostalism and a teenage preaching prodigy, Baldwin describes his writing style as influenced by the King James Bible and the storefront church.¹ Verses from the Bible and snippets of gospel music pervade Baldwin’s texts. Yet religion also appears in Baldwin’s work as something he has overcome, a distasteful encounter with authoritarianism that he passed through to reach his present secular, democratic enlightenment. If this is the case, the religious language that appears in Baldwin’s texts could be read as rhetorical flourish,<br>

  Author(s) Nyers Peter<br>
  Abstract: Both as a moral and political project, cosmopolitanism is invested in a universalism that promotes the impartial treatment of all human beings, irrespective of one’s place of birth, ethnicity, race, gender/sexuality, or religion. Cosmopolitanism, then, is committed to a process of internationalization in which human beings everywhere are world citizens with basic rights grounded in natural law, that is, with rights which cannot be denied by any person(s), group(s), institution(s), or constituted authority, including the nation-state. Stressing the rights of the individual rather than those of the sovereign state, cosmopolitanism thus favours what Brown and Held call a “non-national sense<br>

                  The Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative(Ryan, 2005, p. 590). What makes a narrative worth telling, it suggests tongue-in-cheek, are religion, aristocracy, sex and mystery. The formula illustrates how tellability depends on the subject matter of the narrative. Ryan points out that such salience can be, on the one hand, grounded in universally relevant topics (such as sex and death) and, on the other hand, be related to cultural contexts (for example the interest in the<br>

It is also marked by a certain indifferentism: indifference to—and distrust of—organized religion with its institutional and doctrinal apparatus.¹ Having distanced themselves from long-established church teachings, many non-churchgoers are simply disaffiliated from any particular Jewish or Christian denomination. Some of them nevertheless maintain they are still “religious.” Yet, a fast-growing segment of North Americans reject the label “religious” and prefer to call themselves “spiritual.”²<br>

  Book Title: How to Do Comparative Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VON STOSCH KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: How To Do Comparative Theology therefore contributes to the maturation of method in the field of comparative theological studies, learning across religious borders, by bringing together essays drawing on different Christian traditions of learning, Judaism and Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, the wisdom of senior scholars, and also insights from a younger generation of scholars who have studied theology and religion in new ways, and are more attuned to the language of the "spiritual but not religious." The essays in this volume show great diversity in method, and also-over and again and from many angles-coherence in intent, a commitment to one learning from the other, and a confidence that one's home tradition benefits from fair and unhampered learning from other and very different spiritual and religious traditions. It therefore shows the diversity and coherence of comparative theology as an emerging discipline today.<br>

  Abstract: The name of our discipline contains a methodologically significant ambiguity.

  Abstract: New thinking in queer temporalities and affects outside of the (temporally, affectively charged) field of religion constitutes a challenge and invitation to stretch queer thinking in theology yet again, and further. Although feminist, womanist, process, and other theorists in religion and theology have been working around the fuzzy borders and stubborn impasses that fleshy experiences—bodies and histories of bodies—present, queerly inflected affect theory expands these moves into a complex materialism.¹ Affect theory’s approach to embodiment in terms of the deeply constitutive dynamics of temporality, proximity, touch, and even elemental gravitation provides a conceptual framework that helpfully limits any<br>

  Book Title: Reasoning from Faith-Fundamental Theology in Merold Westphal’s Philosophy of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SANDS JUSTIN<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: So far, the argument against the autonomy project or, more specifically, the religion-within-the-limits-of-reason-alone project has proceeded in two stages, unequal in length. First, a crucial premise of the enterprise has shown itself to be unsustainable. It is the assumption that human reason is universal, part of the standard equipment of human nature. As such, it is presumed to be objective, neutral, presuppositionless, the only source of reliable knowledge. As such, it is “nonsectarian” by contrast with the plurality of “religions of the book,” those that appeal to the authority of some particular divine revelation and are in this way heteronomous.<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Parmentier Richard J.<br>
  Abstract: Brilliantly articulating the potent intersections of semiotic and linguistic anthropology, Signs and Society demonstrates how a keen appreciation of signs helps us better understand human agency, meaning, and creativity. Inspired by the foundational contributions of C. S. Peirce and Ferdinand de Saussure, and drawing upon key insights from neighboring scholarly fields, noted anthropologist Richard J. Parmentier develops an array of innovative conceptual tools for ethnographic, historical, and literary research. His concepts of "transactional value," "metapragmatic interpretant," and "circle of semiosis," for example, illuminate the foundations and effects of such diverse cultural forms and practices as economic exchanges on the Pacific island of Palau, Pindar's Victory Odes in ancient Greece, and material representations of transcendence in ancient Egypt and medieval Christianity. Other studies complicate the separation of emic and etic analytical models for such cultural domains as religion, economic value, and semiotic ideology. Provocative and absorbing, these fifteen pioneering essays blaze a trail into anthropology's future while remaining firmly rooted in its celebrated past.<br>

  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism. The book will appeal to both those actively involved in religious negotiation and to scholars and students of religion in history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and political science.<br>

  Book Title: Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Tattam Helen<br>
  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973) stands outside the traditional canon of twentieth-century French philosophers. Where he is not simply forgotten or overlooked, he is dismissed as a ‘relentlessly unsystematic’ thinker, or, following Jean-Paul Sartre’s lead, labelled a ‘Christian existentialist’ — a label that avoids consideration of Marcel’s work on its own terms. How is one to appreciate Marcel’s contribution, especially when his oeuvre appears to be at odds with philosophical convention?

  Abstract: According to a biblical passage (cited earlier), religious faith is meant to be “the salt of the earth” (Matthew 5:13). This suggests that religion is meant to be neither separated or divorced from the world nor collapsed into it, but to serve as a ferment or challenge in the midst of human affairs. The same idea is captured in the well-known phrase that religious or spiritual people are

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

  Abstract: Coming from the West, the contemporary traveler to India often has the sense of visiting another planet. Many customs and practices seem alien or remote, as do the underlying beliefs and motives. If this is true of contemporary India, how much greater would this sense of distance be if visiting medieval India? That place, with its philosophy, literature, and religion, would seem like a lost city, surrounded by nearly impenetrable underbrush. How would one approach such a place, from our modern angle, without disrupting or violating its intrinsic order? Clearly, if such a visit were attempted, one would have to<br>

  Book Title: Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Good-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): DeCrane Susanne M.<br>
  Abstract: To dismiss the work of philosophers and theologians of the past because of their limited perceptions of the whole of humankind is tantamount to tossing the tot out with the tub water. Such is the case when feminist scholars of religion and ethics confront Thomas Aquinas, whose views of women can only be described as misogynistic. Rather than dispense with him, Susanne DeCrane seeks to engage Aquinas and reflect his otherwise compelling thought through the prism of feminist theology, hermeneutics, and ethics. Focusing on one of Aquinas's great intellectual contributions, the fundamental notion of "the common good"-in short, the human will toward peace and justice-DeCrane demonstrates the currency of that notion through a contemporary social issue: women's health care in the United States and, specifically, black women and breast cancer. In her skillful re-engagement with Aquinas, DeCrane shows that certain aspects of religious traditions heretofore understood as oppressive to women and minority groups can actually be parsed, "retrieved," and used to rectify social ills.
      Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Goodis a bold and intellectually rigorous feminist retrieval of an important text by a Catholic scholar seeking to remain in the tradition, while demanding that the tradition live up to its emphasis on human equity and justice.<br>

  Abstract: Hermeneutical theology is a distinct approach to theology. Hermeneutics itself is the science of interpretation.¹ Since Christianity is a textually based religion shaped by and oriented around a particular set of symbols, Christian theology needs to reinterpret its significant doctrines, texts,² and symbols for each new generation and within each new culture in which it emerges. Such interpretation is necessary for several reasons: on anthropological grounds, in light of the principle of analogy, because of the nature of foundational documents themselves, and, finally, in light of the hermeneutics of suspicion.³<br>

  Book Title: Building a Better Bridge-Muslims, Christians, and the Common Good<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ipgrave Michael<br>
  Abstract: Building a Better Bridgeis a record of the fourth "Building Bridges" seminar held in Sarajevo in 2005 as part of an annual symposium on Muslim-Christian relations cosponsored by Georgetown University and the Archbishop of Canterbury. This volume presents the texts of the public lectures with regional presentations on issues of citizenship, religious believing and belonging, and the relationship between government and religion-both from the immediate situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and from three contexts further afield: Britain, Malaysia, and West Africa. Both Christian and Muslim scholars propose key questions to be faced in addressing the issue of the common good. How do we approach the civic sphere as believers in particular faiths and as citizens of mixed societies? What makes us who we are, and how do our religious and secular allegiances relate to one another? How do we accommodate our commitment to religious values with acknowledgment of human disagreement, and how can this be expressed in models of governance and justice? How are we, mandated by scriptures to be caretakers, to respond to the current ecological and economic disorder of our world? Michael Ipgrave and his contributors do not claim to provide definitive answers to these questions, but rather they further a necessary dialogue and show that, while Christian and Islamic understandings of God may differ sharply and perhaps irreducibly, the acknowledgment of one another as people of faith is the surest ground on which to build trust, friendship, and cooperation.<br>

  Abstract: For Christians and for Muslims, religion is not just a question of belonging to a community; it is also a force that seeks to contribute to the transformation of society. Muslims and Christians alike know themselves to be mandated by divine imperatives, informed by divine values, which must be offered to the task of reshaping the world in which they live. It is questionable indeed whether the process of interpretation and application that enables this can be straightforward even in religiously homogeneous contexts; it certainly is much more complex in societies marked by both religious diversity and a measure of<br>

  Abstract: What are human rights? Can theology acknowledge human rights discourse? Is theological engagement with human rights justified? What place should this discourse occupy within ethics? Ethna Regan seeks to answer these questions about human rights, Christian theology, and philosophical ethics. The main purpose of this book is to justify and explore theological engagement with human rights. Regan illustrates how that engagement is both ecumenical and diverse, citing the emerging engagement with human rights discourse by evangelical theologians in response to the War on Terror. The book examines where the themes and concerns of key modern theologians-Karl Rahner, J. B. Metz, Jon Sobrino, and Ignacio Ellacuría-converge with the themes and concerns of those committed to the advancement of human rights. Regan also critically engages with the "disdain" for rights discourse that is found in the postliberal critiques of John Milbank and Stanley Hauerwas. This interdisciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars in the fields of systematic theology, theological ethics, human rights, religion and politics, and political theory.<br>

  Book Title: Ethics in Light of Childhood-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall John<br>
  Abstract: Childhood faces humanity with its own deepest and most perplexing questions. An ethics that truly includes the world's childhoods would transcend pre-modern traditional communities and modern rational autonomy with a postmodern aim of growing responsibility. It would understand human relations in a poetic rather than universalistic sense as openly and interdependently creative. As a consequence, it would produce new understandings of moral being, time, and otherness, as well as of religion, rights, narrative, families, obligation, and power.
      Ethics in Light of Childhoodfundamentally reimagines ethical thought and practice in light of the experiences of the third of humanity who are children. Much like humanism, feminism, womanism, and environmentalism, Wall argues, a new childism is required that transforms moral thinking, relations, and societies in fundamental ways. Wall explores childhood's varied impacts on ethical thinking throughout history, advances the emerging interdisciplinary field of childhood studies, and reexamines basic assumptions in contemporary moral theory and practice. In the process, he does not just apply ethics to childhood but applies childhood to ethics-in order to imagine a more expansive humanity.<br>

Making critical use of theory, old and new, Mayer breaks through unexamined assumptions and prevailing debates about the attributes of these particular revolutions to raise broader and more disturbing questions about the nature of revolutionary violence attending new foundations.<br>

  Abstract: The french and Russian revolutions originated and unfolded in countries in which a monopolistic official religion and church permeated every aspect of civil and political society. There was no carrying through consequential reforms, let alone revolutionary transformations, without significantly changing the relationship between, on the one hand, the political, social, and cultural spheres and, on the other, the ecclesiastic sphere. Since criticism of church and, to a lesser degree, religion was central to the enlightenments of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it is hardly surprising that after 1789 and 1917 there should have been a drive for disestablishment, followed by<br>

  Author(s): OLMSTED WENDY<br>
  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  Abstract: Christian faith evokes diverse and sometimes competing images and associations. For some, it conjures up a fairly coherent, albeit complexly interrelated array of experiences, dispositions, attitudes, and beliefs. For others, faith names not so much the defining subjective features of religious consciousness as the objective content of Christian religion. Faith is thus construed as a set of doctrines, a peculiar body of teaching and instruction. In short, faith is a divine “deposit” — with the church or the Bible acting as its repository.<br>

First, it will be shown that Qohelet was not as heterodox as some have maintained. Actually, he represents a return to a more primitive form of the Israelite religion and faith. He utilizes minor elements of traditional wisdom to construct his theological position, which means that he simply reconfigures traditional wisdom. Second, it will be demonstrated that<br>

  Abstract: I’d like to begin with what should to be an obvious point. That the translator should make an attempt to grasp the writer’s presuppositions. Translation is not just the stringing together of the most accurate synonyms by the most proximate syntax. Kant’s “Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason” is written with the presupposition that mere (rather than pure) reason is a programmed structure, with in-built possibilities of misfiring, and nothing but calculation as a way of setting right.¹ Since the eighteenth century, English translators, not resonating with Kant’s philosophical presuppositions, have psychologized every noun, making Kant sound like a<br>

  Abstract: In 1957 Claude Lévi-Strauss published his influential essay, “The Sorcerer and His Magic.” Lévi-Strauss’s essay built the foundation of a structuralist approach to the anthropological study of sorcery, healing, and religion. In a remarkable analysis Lévi-Strauss demonstrated that sorcerous ideologies were based on sociological fictions reinforced by magical sleight of hand. In the end the power of the sorcerer, he argued, rested not in an intrinsic power, but in the symbolic power of his or her relationship in the cultural continuum of illness and health.¹ Lévi-Strauss’s argument is based on data gleaned not from his own fieldwork in Brazil but<br>

The manuscript is a notebook for private use, with unconnected and slapdash, barely readable jottings on a range of topics, mainly politics (passionately anti-Orange), religion and – most importantly – sex; our author has a marked fascination for perversities and monstrosities in this area.

  Book Title: The King James Version at 400-Assessing Its Genius as Bible Translation and Its Literary Influence<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Towner Philip H.<br>
  Abstract: In this collection of essays, thirty scholars from diverse disciplines offer their unique perspectives on the genius of the King James Version, a translation whose 400th anniversary was recently celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. While avoiding nostalgia and hagiography, each author clearly appreciates the monumental, formative role the KJV has had on religious and civil life on both sides of the Atlantic (and beyond) as well as on the English language itself. In part 1 the essayists look at the KJV in its historical contexts—the politics and rapid language growth of the era, the emerging printing and travel industries, and the way women are depicted in the text (and later feminist responses to such depictions). Part 2 takes a closer look at the KJV as a translation and the powerful precedents it set for all translations to follow, with the essayists exploring the translators’ principles and processes (with close examinations of “Bancroft’s Rules" and the Prefaces), assessing later revisions of the text, and reviewing the translation’s influence on the English language, textual criticism, and the practice of translation in Jewish and Chinese contexts. Part 3 looks at the various ways the KJV has impacted the English language and literature, the practice of religion (including within the African American and Eastern Orthodox churches), and the broader culture. The contributors are Robert Alter, C. Clifton Black, David G. Burke, Richard A. Burridge, David J. A. Clines, Simon Crisp, David J. Davis, James D. G. Dunn, Lori Anne Ferrell, Leonard J.

  Abstract: “The Bible only,” the English churchman William Chillingworth wrote in 1638, “is the religion of Protestants.” Whether it was also the religion of England’s Protestant church is the question that prompts this essay. It is a question rarely asked. A number of recent books, shrewdly timed to take advantage of the 400th anniversary of the so-called King James Bible, have focused our attention onto that enterprise of 1611 and the processes, political and scholarly, that allowed other early modern Bibles to be rendered into English. We are now well educated in the Bible’s literary influence, reception, and modes of translation.<br>

  Author(s): PLATTEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Michel Tournier is a writer who explores complex philosophical questions in the guise of concrete, imagistic narratives. This comprehensive study privileges the notion of literary reference, by which the world of text is understood or experienced in metaphorical relation to the world outside of it. Metaphor, in the context of Tournier’s fiction, shows how the fantastic merges with the real to provide new perspectives on many diverse aspects of the modern world: the Crusoe myth, Nazism, the value to society of art and religion, and the nature of education. This book elucidates an aesthetic of Tournier’s fiction that encompasses the writer’s stated ambition to ‘go beyond literature’.<br>

  Abstract: This statement from Voltaire is readily cited to underline the sovereignty of the human being said to have been unleashed in the eighteenth century, when people broke free of religion and metaphysics. The human being, it is suggested, also determines the position of God and, if needed, for reasons of social control for example, may occupy His position argumentatively. Belief in God is no longer a theologically grounded, self-evident commandment; it is universally useful or, to use more modern language, ideologically fungible.<br>

  Abstract: The historico-political developments following September 11 2001 have raised the profile of Islam and its political relevance. From a secular and liberal perspective, religious/transcendental struggles should be confined to the private domain and should concern individual consciences. However, the forceful entry of Islam as a topic into the public domain post-9/11 represents a questioning of the secular/liberal world. This raises broader questions about the links between religion and politics and the relevance of religious interpretations for our life in common and in the commons, that is, in the public domain.

  Book Title: Migrating Texts and Traditions-  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Sweet William<br>
  Abstract: There can be little dispute that culture influences philosophy: we see this in the way that classical Greek culture influenced Greek philosophy, that Christianity influenced mediaeval western philosophy, that French culture influenced a range of philosophies in France from Cartesianism to post-modernism, and so on. Yet many philosophical texts and traditions have also been introduced into very different cultures and philosophical traditions than their cultures of origin – through war and colonialization, but also through religion and art, and through commercial relations and globalization. And this raises questions such as: What is it to do French philosophy in Africa, or Analytic philosophy in India, or Buddhist philosophy in North America? This volume examines the phenomenon of the ‘migration’ of philosophical texts and traditions into other cultures, identifies places where it may have succeeded, but also where it has not, and discusses what is presupposed in introducing a text or a tradition into another intellectual culture.<br>

In the particular case of philosophy’s perennial struggles with religion, language continues to be at the centre of much critical attention. For without sustained and careful attention to the vagaries of language, taking the critical measure of the sense and significance of the dynamic relations between religious experience and its quite various reflective articulations cannot be satisfactory.²<br>

  Abstract: One of the most powerful words in the English language, "corruption" is also one of the most troubled concepts in law. According to Laura Underkuffler, it is a concept based on religiously revealed ideas of good and evil. But the notion of corruption defies the ordinary categories by which law defines crimes-categories that punish acts, not character, and that eschew punishment on the basis of religion and emotion. Drawing on contemporary examples-including former assemblywoman Diane Gordon and former governor Rod Blagojevich-Underkuffler explores the implications and dangers of maintaining such an archaic concept at the heart of criminal law.<br>

In doing so, they take an important step toward creating a society that reconciles scientific inquiry with the human spirit.

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

  Abstract: At the most basic level, how ought we to think about the ways in which individuals relate to their cultures, traditions, or religions? In the study of religion, a Western discipline devoted to a concept rooted in the histories of Western societies, the relation between individuals and religions is most often framed in two ways, cognitive and social: a person (ideally at least) “believes in” (the cognitive aspect) the core claims of the religion to which he “belongs” (the social aspect).¹ This model of religious participation, usually taken for granted as universally applicable, works well in—because it arose in<br>

  Book Title: The Phantom Heroine-Ghosts and Gender in Seventeenth-Century Chinese Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLIN JUDITH T.<br>
  Abstract: The "phantom heroine"—in particular the fantasy of her resurrection through sex with a living man—is one of the most striking features of traditional Chinese literature. Even today the hypersexual female ghost continues to be a source of fascination in East Asian media, much like the sexually predatory vampire in American and European movies, TV, and novels. But while vampires can be of either gender, erotic Chinese ghosts are almost exclusively female. The significance of this gender asymmetry in Chinese literary history is the subject of Judith Zeitlin’s elegantly written and meticulously researched new book. Zeitlin’s study centers on the seventeenth century, one of the most interesting and creative periods of Chinese literature and politically one of the most traumatic, witnessing the overthrow of the Ming, the Manchu conquest, and the subsequent founding of the Qing. Drawing on fiction, drama, poetry, medical cases, and visual culture, the author departs from more traditional literary studies, which tend to focus on a single genre or author. Ranging widely across disciplines, she integrates detailed analyses of great literary works with insights drawn from the history of medicine, art history, comparative literature, anthropology, religion, and performance studies. The Phantom Heroine probes the complex literary and cultural roots of the Chinese ghost tradition. Zeitlin is the first to address its most remarkable feature: the phenomenon of verse attributed to phantom writers—that is, authors actually reputed to be spirits of the deceased. She also makes the case for the importance of lyric poetry in developing a ghostly aesthetics and image code. Most strikingly, Zeitlin shows that the representation of female ghosts, far from being a marginal preoccupation, expresses cultural concerns of central importance.<br>

  Author(s) Oh Kang-nam<br>
  Abstract: Sociological studies have often found that institutional disorganization and the loss of the social function of religion may occur when society becomes modernized. Peter Berger summed it up thus: “The impact of modernity on religion is commonly seen in terms of the process of secularization, which can be described as one in which religion loses its hold on the level both of institutions and of human consciousness.”¹ Berger’s harsh assessment may well describe the state of the Korean Protestant church today. For the last forty years, a startling wave of modernization accompanied by industrialization, urbanization, and rapid social mobility have<br>

  Book Title: Cult, Culture and Authority-Princess Lieu Hanh in Vietnamese History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DROR OLGA<br>
  Abstract: Princess Liễu Hạnh, often called the Mother of the Vietnamese people by her followers, is one of the most prominent goddesses in Vietnamese popular religion. First emerging some four centuries ago as a local sect appealing to women, the princess’ cult has since transcended its geographical and gender boundaries and remains vibrant today. Who was this revered deity? Was she a virtuous woman or a prostitute? Why did people begin worshiping her and why have they continued? Cult, Culture, and Authority traces Liễu Hạnh’s cult from its ostensible appearance in the sixteenth century to its present-day prominence in North Vietnam and considers it from a broad range of perspectives, as religion and literature and in the context of politics and society. Over time, Liễu Hạnh’s personality and cult became the subject of numerous literary accounts, and these historical texts are a major source for this book. Author Olga Dror explores the authorship and historical context of each text considered, treating her subject in an interdisciplinary way. Her interest lies in how these accounts reflect the various political agendas of successive generations of intellectuals and officials. The same cult was called into service for a variety of ideological ends: feminism, nationalism, Buddhism, or Daoism.<br>

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Abstract: Given its affinity with questions of identity, autobiography offers a way into the interior space between author and reader, especially when writers define themselves in terms of religion. In his exploration of this "textual intimacy," Wesley Kort begins with a theorization of what it means to say who one is and how one's self-account as a religious person stands in relation to other forms of self-identification. He then provides a critical analysis of autobiographical texts by nine contemporary American writers-including Maya Angelou, Philip Roth, and Anne Lamott-who give religion a positive place in their accounts of who they are. Finally, in disclosing his own religious identity, Kort concludes with a meditation on several meanings of the word

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Jung Kevin<br>
  Abstract: It is often assumed that the law and religion address different spheres of human life. Religion and ethics articulate complex systems of moral reasoning that concern norms, deliberation of ends, cultivation of disposition, and transformation of moral agency. Law, in contrast, seeks to govern human conduct through procedural justice, rights, and public good. Doing Justice to Mercy challenges this assumption by presenting the reader with an urgent conversation between the law and religion that yields a constructive approach, both theoretically and practically, to the complex role of mercy in our legal process.<br>

  Author(s): Struck Peter T.<br>
  Abstract: The book notes that Aristotle and his followers did not discuss the use of poetic symbolism. Rather, a different group of Greek thinkers--the allegorists--were the first to develop the notion. Struck extensively revisits the work of the great allegorists, which has been underappreciated. He links their interest in symbolism to the importance of divination and magic in ancient times, and he demonstrates how important symbolism became when they thought about religion and philosophy. "They see the whole of great poetic language as deeply figurative," he writes, "with the potential always, even in the most mundane details, to be freighted with hidden messages."<br>

  Author(s): Geertz Clifford<br>
  Abstract: Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism.

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  Book Title: Scripture, Canon and Commentary-A Comparison of Confucian and Western Exegesis<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HENDERSON JOHN B.<br>
  Abstract: In this major contribution to the study of the Chinese classics and comparative religion, John Henderson uses the history of exegesis to illuminate mental patterns that have universal and perennial significance for intellectual history. Henderson relates the Confucian commentarial tradition to other primary exegetical traditions, particularly the Homeric tradition, Vedanta, rabbinic Judaism, ancient and medieval Christian biblical exegesis, and Qur'anic exegesis. In making such comparisons, he discusses some basic assumptions common to all these traditions--such as that the classics or scriptures are comprehensive or that they contain all significant knowledge or truth and analyzes the strategies deployed to support these presuppositions. As shown here, primary differences among commentarial or exegetical traditions arose from variations in their emphasis on one or another of these assumptions and strategies. Henderson demonstrates that exegetical modes of thought were far from arcane: they dominated the post-classical/premodern intellectual world. Some have persisted or re-emerged in modern times, particularly in ideologies such as Marxism. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Scripture, Canon, and Commentary is not only a challenging interpretation of comparative scriptural traditions but also an excellent introduction to the study of the Confucian classics.<br>

  Abstract: Calling eighteenth-century French authors either
                  philosophesor moralists is a misnomer in both cases, for they were usually neither. They identified themselves asphilosophes, but they had little in common with philosophers like Hume or Kant. There was no intention to deceive on their part. By posing asphilosophesthey intended to stand in the name of reason, outside any considerations of religion or even of metaphysics. Unlike most of their predecessors, who usually stopped short of tackling revelation, thephilosophesopenly crossed this threshold and claimed total intellectual freedom.

  Abstract: In the history of Being presented by postmodernity, does Christianity represent a
                  chancefor rethinking Being and rewriting the meaning of the philosophical vocation? This seems to be one of the most meaningful demands put forth in the reflections of Gianni Vattimo, especially in the wake of his philosophical proposal that finds anouvertureunder debate in the metaphor of weak thought, in the sense that it radicalizes a form of reflection that is (seemingly) closer to deconstruction. The issue appears even more intriguing if it is limited to the relation between philosophy and religion. There is a well-known irreconcilability<br>

  Abstract: In most countries in Asia, one chooses to become, rather than happens to be, a Christian. When one makes a religious choice for a foreign religion such as Christianity, one bases the choice on the difference from, not the similarity with, the existing indigenous religions. In this chapter, I will illustrate the critical differences, as the ground of women’s

Challenging the status quo of religions and moving toward a more just and transformative religion require breaking what I would call an ecumenical taboo, which discourages one from addressing critical differences between religions.

  Abstract: In the years since Ian Barbour’s first set of Gifford Lectures titled

While this extended conversation between theologians and scientists has opened up many new avenues for fruitful exchange of views on controversial issues, other “doors,” so to speak, remain closed. For example, scientific materialists consciously or unconsciously seem to be proposing the equivalent of a secular religion, that is, a belief-system opposed to the belief-systems of the various theistic religions; but their own secular belief-system can no more be proven<br>

  Abstract: Although not a professional historian, the author raises several issues pertinent to the state of history today. Qualifying the 'non-historian' as an 'able' interventionist in historical studies, the author explores the relationship between history and theory within the current epistemological configurations and refigurations. He asks how history transcends the obsessive 'linguistic' turn, which has been hegemonizing literary/discourse analysis, and focuses greater attention on historical experience and where history stands in relation to our understanding of ethics, religion and the current state of global politics that underlines the manipulation and abuse of history.<br>

Even so, dogma continues to be relied upon in certain areas of life where we strive for a form of authoritative certitude, such as religion, or law. It seems as if our quest for stability here warrants the use of a modus of a thought that builds upon a set of premises that are accepted without constant critical re-examination, as authoritative.

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Crises are Challenges<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHAH Prakash<br>
  Abstract: Within the framework of the Forum A. & A Leysen, several experts from in and outside the Muslim world contributed to this book. In Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges they discuss how dialogues between Islam and the West, with a focus on Europe, can be achieved. The various authors (legal scholars, political theorists, social scientists, and psychologists) explore in these collected essays such interrelated questions as: How much diversity is permissible within a liberal pluralistic democratic society? How strong are the implications of citizenship? What are equitable accommodations of contested practices? They argue for an adequate understanding of how Western Muslim communities in Europe experience their minority position and what needs to be done to improve their participation in European society. The second part of this volume is a collection of papers written around the work of Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, who also makes his own contribution to the book. The Catholic University of Leuven awarded An-Na'im an honorary doctorate in 2009 on the theme of multiculturalism, intercultural relations and diversity. An-Na'im is recognized the world over as a leading expert in the area of religion and law, and as a human rights activist. Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges reinforces our sense that a better knowledge and awareness of the growing diversity of our society, and striving for harmonious relations between Islam and the West, are among the most important challenges of our time.

As to democracy, Muslim traditionalists use to juxtapose its mechanisms to the ‘eternal provisions of God-given Sharia’.

  Abstract: The developments associated with synthetic biology and other new genetic technologies raise profound questions in many different areas. Among others, they touch on issues of religion, metaphysics, and morality. Without in any way denigrating the importance of these deep and weighty issues, I am going to argue that the answers we give to these questions are largely independent of the answers we give to another set of concerns—those of public policy. Our answers to theological, to metaphysical, and in an important sense to moral questions about the technologies associated with genetic manipulation should not have any

  Author(s): Abdelhady Dalia<br>
  Abstract: The Lebanese are the largest group of Middle Eastern immigrants in the United States, and Lebanese immigrants are also prominent across Europe and the Americas. Based on over eighty interviews with first-generation Lebanese immigrants in the global cities of New York, Montreal and Paris, this book shows that the Lebanese diaspora - like all diasporas - constructs global relations connecting and transforming their new societies, previous homeland and world-wide communities. Taking Lebanese immigrants' forms of identification, community attachments and cultural expression as manifestations of diaspora experiences, Dalia Abdelhady delves into the ways members of Lebanese diasporic communities move beyond nationality, ethnicity and religion, giving rise to global solidarities and negotiating their social and cultural spaces.The Lebanese Diaspora explores new forms of identities, alliances and cultural expressions, elucidating the daily experiences of Lebanese immigrants and exploring new ways of thinking about immigration, ethnic identity, community, and culture in a global world. By criticizing and challenging our understandings of nationality, ethnicity and assimilation, Abdelhady shows that global immigrants are giving rise to new forms of cosmopolitan citizenship.<br>

  Abstract: One of the central issues in the relationship of politics and religion is the status, scope, and limits of religious toleration. Although the principle of toleration is generally taken for granted by most Americans in an almost ritualistic fashion, they tend to ignore the controversial character of the principle itself: what it means, how it is to be applied, what its limitations are, and, in general, how it is grounded in moral and political philosophy. When asked about the moral basis of toleration the general answer is that toleration comes from pluralism, and ours is a pluralistic society. Q.E.D. It<br>

  Book Title: Transcendent in America-Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Williamson Lola<br>
  Abstract: Yoga, karma, meditation, guru - these terms, once obscure, are now a part of the American lexicon. Combining Hinduism with Western concepts and values, a new hybrid form of religion has developed in the United States over the past century. In Transcendent in America, Lola Williamson traces the history of various Hindu-inspired movements in America, and argues that together they constitute a discrete category of religious practice, a distinct and identifiable form of new religion.Williamson provides an overview of the emergence of these movements through examining exchanges between Indian Hindus and American intellectuals such as Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and illuminates how Protestant traditions of inner experience paved the way for Hindu-style movements' acceptance in the West.Williamson focuses on three movements - Self-Realization Fellowship, Transcendental Meditation, and Siddha Yoga - as representative of the larger of phenomenon of Hindu-inspired meditation movements. She provides a window into the beliefs and practices of followers of these movements by offering concrete examples from their words and experiences that shed light on their world view, lifestyle, and relationship with their gurus. Drawing on scholarly research, numerous interviews, and decades of personal experience with Hindu-style practices, Williamson makes a convincing case that Hindu-inspired meditation movements are distinct from both immigrant Hinduism and other forms of Asian-influenced or New Age groups.<br>

Their work has been foundational for readers who want not so much to deny as to move beyond historical and philological approaches that obscure biblical literature’s religious and humanistic vitality. Buber and Rosenzweig bring God back into the picture and thus represent a gesture of return to older modes of biblical interpretation.

  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Richard Cándida<br>
  Abstract: More than one hundred years after her death, Elizabeth Cady Stanton still stands - along with her close friend Susan B. Anthony - as the major icon of the struggle for women's suffrage. In spite of this celebrity, Stanton's intellectual contributions have been largely overshadowed by the focus on her political activities, and she is yet to be recognized as one of the major thinkers of the nineteenth century.Here, at long last, is a single volume exploring and presenting Stanton's thoughtful, original, lifelong inquiries into the nature, origins, range, and solutions of women's subordination. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker reintroduces, contextualizes, and critiques Stanton's numerous contributions to modern thought. It juxtaposes a selection of Stanton's own writings, many of them previously unavailable, with eight original essays by prominent historians and social theorists interrogating Stanton's views on such pressing social issues as religion, marriage, race, the self and community, and her place among leading nineteenth century feminist thinkers. Taken together, these essays and documents reveal the different facets, enduring insights, and fascinating contradictions of the work of one of the great thinkers of the feminist tradition.Contributors: Barbara Caine, Richard Candida Smith, Ellen Carol DuBois, Ann D.

In this piece, Stanton linked discrimination “against color and sex” with her protest against aristocracy, caste systems, and religion that sanctifies hierarchy. The piece concludes with a stirring reminder that “political, religious, industrial and social freedom” are inseparable.

  Book Title: Religious Imaginaries-The Liturgical and Poetic Practices of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): DIELEMAN KAREN<br>
  Abstract: Religious Imaginariesexplores liturgical practice as formative for how three Victorian women poets imagined the world and their place in it and, consequently, for how they developed their creative and critical religious poetics. In doing so, this new study rethinks several assumptions in the field: that Victorian women's faith commitments tend to limit creativity; that the contours of church experiences matter little for understanding religious poetry; and that gender is more significant than liturgy in shaping women's religious poetry.Exploring the import of bodily experience for spiritual, emotional, and cognitive forms of knowing, Karen Dieleman explains and clarifies the deep orientations of different strands of nineteenth-century Christianity, such as Congregationalism's high regard for verbal proclamation, Anglicanism and Anglo-Catholicism's valuation of manifestation, and revivalist Roman Catholicism's recuperation of an affective aesthetic. Looking specifically at Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter as astute participants in their chosen strands of Christianity, Dieleman reveals the subtle textures of these women's religious poetry: the different voices, genres, and aesthetics they create in response to their worship experiences. Part recuperation, part reinterpretation, Dieleman's readings highlight each poet's innovative religious poetics.Dieleman devotes two chapters to each of the three poets: the first chapter in each pair delineates the poet's denominational practices and commitments; the second reads the corresponding poetry.Religious Imaginarieshas appeal for scholars of Victorian literary criticism and scholars of Victorian religion, supporting its theoretical paradigm by digging deeply into primary sources associated with the actual churches in which the poets worshipped, detailing not only the liturgical practices but also the architectural environments that influenced the worshipper's formation.

  Abstract: Because Barrett Browning’s connection to Congregationalism in her adult life has been under-recognized to date, this chapter necessarily begins with remapping the poet’s postmarriage religious commitments. Though somewhat preliminary to the main argument of the chapter, the opening pages resituate Barrett Browning within—or at least close to—a church group that has mistakenly been judged in its midcentury character by the theology and practice of an earlier time. The mistake matters for literary studies because it has marred our perception of the importance of religion to arguably the most important woman poet of the period. Certain of Barrett Browning’s<br>

                     In the Service of Reason.Even if most of his colleagues, then as now, would have learned to express themselves with more modesty, this is how they look upon themselves and their profession, and I am no exception. We always have the vision of a more rational organization of society, of a sane world.<br>

  Abstract: In

Inevitably, this is a categorisation that is difficult to define precisely, either historically or conceptually. Nevertheless, we can see many of the diverse movements and figures of the modernist breakthrough as sharing a concern to achieve a decisively unambiguous life, piercing through the superficial compromises of bourgeois society, looking reality in the face, and affirming the truth of iving personality. In this situation, values of honesty,<br>

  Author(s) Janz Bruce B.<br>
  Abstract: Much of Continental philosophy of religion is reflection on faith (as response to revelation) and reason (as philosophical reflection). Having made the linguistic turn, it intersects with analytic discussion of the problem of religious language, at least if the question is understood as concerning the nature and limits of our God-talk rather than its warrant. Since philosophy often takes the form of phenomenology, the question can be put this way: does reason, so conceived, prescribe the limits within which our Godtalk must stay (as in Kant’s
                  Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone), or does it describe the limits that<br>

Whatever might be thought of the general level on which it has been taken up in our contemporary debates, this resurgence of religion facilitates the leap of historical imagination required to take us back to the intellectual climate of the nineteenth century, especially its first half.

Both were born in Singapore, of Chinese descent, and both became very influential in the dynamic intellectual scene that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century.

Whether it is accused of anaesthetising an otherwise potentially revolutionary subject or generating war and political conflict, religion is often derided in secular political theory as the basis of unthinking faith, trust in traditional hierarchy, or mystical fanaticism. Against this irrationalism, the dominant forms of contemporary political theory attempt to make sense of the world by diagnosing social and political malignancies and advocating alternative paths to a better world free from the dangerous competition of political viewpoints or the fruitless pursuit of any number of religious<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

  Book Title: Broken Tablets-Levinas, Derrida, and the Literary Afterlife of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAMMERSCHLAG SARAH<br>
  Abstract: Over a span of thirty years, twentieth-century French philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida held a conversation across texts. Sharing a Jewish heritage and a background in phenomenology, both came to situate their work at the margins of philosophy, articulating this placement through religion and literature. Chronicling the interactions between these thinkers, Sarah Hammerschlag argues that the stakes in their respective positions were more than philosophical. They were also political. Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

  Book Title: Situating Existentialism-Key Texts in Context<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERNASCONI ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Emphasizing the multidisciplinary and global nature of existential arguments, the chosen texts relate to philosophy, religion, literature, theater, and culture and reflect European, Russian, Latin American, African, and American strains of thought. Readings are grouped into three thematic categories: national contexts, existentialism and religion, and transcultural migrations that explore the reception of existentialism. The volume explains how literary giants such as Dostoevsky and Tolstoy were incorporated into the existentialist fold and how inclusion into the canon recast the work of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and it describes the roles played by Jaspers and Heidegger in Germany and the Paris School of existentialism in France. Essays address not only frequently assigned works but also underappreciated discoveries, underscoring their vital relevance to contemporary critical debate. Designed to speak to a new generation's concerns, the collection deploys a diverse range of voices to interrogate the fundamental questions of the human condition.<br>

  Book Title: Reimagining the Sacred-Richard Kearney Debates God with James Wood, Catherine Keller, Charles Taylor, Julia Kristeva, Gianni Vattimo, Simon Critchley, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, David Tracey, Jens Zimmermann, and Merold Westphal<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

  Author(s) GALLAGHER SHEILA<br>
  Abstract: John Caputo is an American philosopher of religion with particular expertise in phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He is widely known for developing Derrida’s deconstruction into “radical hermeneutics,” a philosophy that subverts any essentialist claims and resists arresting the play of interpretation.¹ This radical hermeneutics is closely aligned with Caputo’s interest in theopoetics, a term that is variously defined by practitioners but that entails the notion that both God and life are best described poetically rather than rationalistically. Theopoetics, at least in Caputo’s radical hermeneutics, and also in Kearney’s anatheism, has connotations of
                  poiein, of making or remaking God through our<br>

  Author(s): Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern political critiques speak of the death of ideology, the end of history, and the postsecular return of religious attitudes, yet radical conservative theorists such as Mark Lilla argue religion and politics are inextricably intertwined. Returning much-needed uncertainty to debates over the political while revitalizing the very terms in which they are defined, María Pía Lara explores the ambiguity of secularization and the theoretical potential of a structural break between politics and religion.<br>

  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas has argued that “although the assumption toward secularization holds for most of Europe, the explanatory power of the secularization hypothesis is now a matter of dispute because the causal connection between secularization and social modernization is no longer posed only as a diachronic and self-referential issue within western culture.”¹ For that reason, he continues, “the encounter with religion as a contemporary intellectual formation requires secular thought to engage in a reflection of its own origins that takes the form of a genealogy of secular post-metaphysical thought within the horizon of the Axial Age and of the discussion of<br>

  Book Title: Religion and the Specter of the West-Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics of Translation<br>

  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: Mandair rethinks the intersection of religion and the secular in discourses such as history of religions, postcolonial theory, and recent continental philosophy. Though seemingly unconnected, these discourses are shown to be linked to a philosophy of "generalized translation" that emerged as a key conceptual matrix in the colonial encounter between India and the West. In this riveting study, Mandair demonstrates how this philosophy of translation continues to influence the repetitions of religion and identity politics in the lives of South Asians, and the way the academy, state, and media have analyzed such phenomena.<br>

Through a case study of Sikhism, I have tried to demonstrate how certain aspects of Sikh and Hindu traditions were reinvented in terms of the category of “religion” during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

In recent years, Habermas has turned his attention to questions pertaining to philosophy and religion, the relationship between reason and faith, and the connection between postmetaphysical thinking and theological endeavors.

  Abstract: To me lucid dreaming is the most interesting of the contemporary Euro-American obsessions with dreams, providing a kind of escape from the world of everyday reality into the dream realm. Several lucid dreamers experience what one might reasonably label dream-visions that provide insights into a transcendental reality, not based on any known religion but rather on an intuitive personal insight into such an imagined reality. In that sense they constitute another form of “secular spirituality” for those who have been disenchanted with traditional religion.<br>

  Abstract: To respond to religion is to ask what religious behaviors and representations mean to us in our individual worlds, and scholars must confront questions of possibility and becoming that arise from testing their beliefs, imperatives, and practices. Roberts refers to the work of Hent de Vries, Eric Santner, and Stanley Cavell, each of whom exemplifies encounter and response in their writings as they traverse philosophy and religion to expose secular thinking to religious thought and practice. This approach highlights the resources religious discourse can offer to a fundamental reorientation of critical thought. In humanistic criticism after secularism, the lines separating the creative, the pious, and the critical themselves become the subject of question and experimentation.<br>

Globalization was at that time seen by theorists as the dominance of the culture of the West (Euro-America) upon the rest of the world (Appadurai 1996; Berger 1997), the “center upon the periphery” (Hannerz 1990:i–x) as cultural flows were thought to move from the hegemonic West to the peripheral rest of the world.

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

Heidegger was steeped in Catholicism to the extent that his bishop subsidized his studies, and he was considered the bright promise of German Catholic thought at the beginning of his career. Perhaps this relationship to Christianity will appear in a new light after the release of more unpublished works in addition to those that have appeared in recent years. Among the latter, the “Einleitung in die Phenomenologie der Religion” (Introduction to the Phenomenology of Religion)¹ has a central place. This is a transcript of the<br>

  Abstract: Vattimo's status as a left-wing faculty president paradoxically made him a target of the Red Brigades in the 1970s, causing him to flee Turin for his life. Left-wing terrorism did not deter the philosopher from his quest for social progress, however, and in the 1980s, he introduced a daring formulation called "weak thought," which stripped metaphysics, science, religion, and all other absolute systems of their authority. Vattimo then became notorious both for his renewed commitment to the core values of Christianity (he was trained as a Catholic intellectual) and for the Vatican's denunciation of his views.<br>

  Abstract: Vattimo and Girard ultimately conclude that secularism and the involvement (or lack thereof) of religion in governance are, in essence, produced by Christianity. In other words, Christianity is "the religion of the exit from religion," and democracy, civil rights, the free market, and individual freedoms are all facilitated by Christian culture. Through an exchange that is both intimate and enlightening, Vattimo and Girard share their unparalleled insight into the relationships among religion, modernity, and the role of Christianity, especially as it exists in our multicultural world.<br>

  Abstract: From the standpoint of “deconstructive nihilism,” modern atheism is only one “metaphysical” creed among many others. The reassurance provided by its supposedly scientific grounding is as illusory as the reassurance of religions, philosophies, and ideologies. A complete liberation from false certainties demands that atheism be deconstructed too, along with other metaphysical illusions. Once this task is accomplished, Christianity should become attractive once again. In a genuinely “nihilistic” world, the religion of the cross should fare better than all the creeds and ideologies that imprudently relied on false scientific “objectivity.” This is what Gianni Vattimo suggests in his recent works, notably<br>

Contributors add fascinating depth to such understudied issues as the historical process of compilation, textual manipulation, physical production and management, sponsorship, the dissemination of various editions, cultic activities surrounding the canon, and the canon's reception in different East Asian societies. The Chinese Buddhist canon is one of the most enduring textual traditions in East Asian religion and culture, and through this exhaustive, multifaceted effort, an essential body of work becomes part of a new, versatile narrative of East Asian Buddhism that has far-reaching implications for world history.<br>

He considers the Divina Commedia in the context of Catholic theology alongside The Journey to the West as it relates to Chinese syncretism, united by the theme of pilgrimage. Yet Yu's focus isn't entirely tied to the classics. He also considers the struggle for human rights in China and how this topic relates to ancient Chinese social thought and modern notions of rights in the West.<br>

  Book Title: Wicked Cinema-Sex and Religion on Screen<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Cutrara Daniel S.<br>
  Abstract: From struggles over identity politics in the 1990s to current concerns about a clash of civilizations between Islam and Christianity, culture wars play a prominent role in the twenty-first century. Movies help to define and drive these conflicts by both reflecting and shaping cultural norms, as well as showing what violates those norms. In this pathfinding book, Daniel S. Cutrara employs queer theory, cultural studies, theological studies, and film studies to investigate how cinema represents and often denigrates religion and religious believers—an issue that has received little attention in film studies, despite the fact that faith in its varied manifestations is at the heart of so many cultural conflicts today.Wicked Cinema examines films from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, including Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Circle, Breaking the Waves, Closed Doors, Agnes of God, Priest, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Dogma. Central to all of the films is their protagonists' struggles with sexual transgression and traditional belief systems within Christianity, Judaism, or Islam—a struggle, Cutrara argues, that positions believers as the Other and magnifies the abuses of religion while ignoring its positive aspects. Uncovering a hazardous web of ideological assumptions informed by patriarchy, the spirit/flesh dichotomy, and heteronormativity, Cutrara demonstrates that ultimately these films emphasize the "Otherness" of the faithful through a variety of strategies commonly used to denigrate the queer, from erasing their existence, to using feminization to make them appear weak, to presenting them as dangerous fanatics.<br>

Thus, for instance, the modern world is roughly equated with not only the sociopolitical results of industrialization but also the philosophical implications of the scientific revolution and Enlightenment rationality, eventually yielding a disenchanted world, however incomplete its achievement may remain.

But what exactly did the Aztecs mean by a "god" (teotl), and how could human beings become gods or take on godlike properties? This sophisticated, interdisciplinary study analyzes three concepts that are foundational to Aztec religion—teotl (god), teixiptla (localized embodiment of a god), and tlaquimilolli (sacred bundles containing precious objects)—to shed new light on the Aztec understanding of how spiritual beings take on form and agency in the material world. In The Fate of Earthly Things, Molly Bassett draws on ethnographic fieldwork, linguistic analyses, visual culture, and ritual studies to explore what ritual practices such as human sacrifice and the manufacture of deity embodiments (including humans who became gods), material effigies, and sacred bundles meant to the Aztecs. She analyzes the Aztec belief that wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim during a sacred rite could transform a priest into an embodiment of a god or goddess, as well as how figurines and sacred bundles could become localized embodiments of gods. Without arguing for unbroken continuity between the Aztecs and modern speakers of Nahuatl, Bassett also describes contemporary rituals in which indigenous Mexicans who preserve costumbres (traditions) incorporate totiotzin (gods) made from paper into their daily lives. This research allows us to understand a religious imagination that found life in death and believed that deity embodiments became animate through the ritual binding of blood, skin, and bone.<br>

  Book Title: Making All the Difference-Inclusion, Exclusion, and American Law<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): MINOW MARTHA<br>
  Abstract: Martha Minow takes a hard look at the way our legal system functions in dealing with people on the basis of race, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, and disability. Minow confronts a variety of dilemmas of difference resulting from contradictory legal strategies-strategies that attempt to correct inequalities by sometimes recognizing and sometimes ignoring differences. Exploring the historical sources of ideas about difference, she offers challenging alternative ways of conceiving of traits that legal and social institutions have come to regard as "different." She argues, in effect, for a constructed jurisprudence based on the ability to recognize and work with perceptible forms of difference.<br>

  Book Title: The Total Work of Art in European Modernism-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Roberts David<br>
  Abstract: The history and theory of the total work of art pose a whole series of questions not only to aesthetic modernism and its utopias but also to the whole epoch from the French Revolution to the totalitarian revolutions of the twentieth century. The total work of art indicates the need to revisit key assumptions of modernism, such as the foregrounding of the autonomy and separation of the arts at the expense of the countertendencies to the reunion of the arts, and cuts across the neat equation of avant-gardism with progress and deconstructs the familiar left-right divide between revolution and reaction, the modern and the antimodern. Situated at the interface between art, religion, and politics, the total work of art invites us to rethink the relationship between art and religion and art and politics in European modernism.<br>

The Bolsheviks in Russia and the Fascists in Italy both recognized the importance of mobilizing the masses through the elaboration of a civil religion.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Adebanwi Wale<br>
  Abstract: Nation as Grand Narrative offers a methodical analysis of how relations of domination and subordination are conveyed through media narratives of nationhood. Using the typical postcolonial state of Nigeria as a template and engaging with disciplines ranging from media studies, political science, and social theory to historical sociology and hermeneutics, Wale Adebanwi examines how the nation as grand narrative provides a critical interpretive lens through which competition among ethnic, ethnoregional, and ethnoreligious groups can be analyzed. Adebanwi illustrates how meaning is connected to power through ideology in the struggles enacted on the pages of the print media over diverse issues including federalism, democracy and democratization, religion, majority-minority ethnic relations, space and territoriality, self-determination, and threat of secession. Nation as Grand Narrative will trigger further critical reflections on the articulation of relations of domination in the context of postcolonial grand narratives.

  Abstract: This collection builds on decades of interdisciplinary scholarship by African American women and gender historians and feminist scholars, bridging the gap between well-developed theories of race, gender, and power and the practice of historical research. It reveals the interdependent construction of racial and gender identity in individuals' lived experiences in specific historical contexts, such as westward expansion, civil rights movements, or economic depression as well as national and transnational debates over marriage, citizenship and sexual mores. All of these essays consider multiple aspects of identity, including sexuality, class, religion, and nationality, among others, but the volume emphasizes gender and race--the focus of our new book series--as principal bases of identity and locations of power and oppression in American history.

  Book Title: Afro-Cuban Diasporas in the Atlantic World-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Otero Solimar<br>
  Abstract: ‘Afro-Cuban Diasporas in the Atlantic World’ explores how Yoruba and Afro-Cuban communities moved across the Atlantic between the Americas and Africa in successive waves in the nineteenth century. In Havana, Yoruba slaves from Lagos banded together to buy their freedom and sail home to Nigeria. Once in Lagos, this Cuban repatriate community became known as the Aguda. This community built their own neighborhood that celebrated their Afrolatino heritage. For these Yoruba and Afro-Cuban diasporic populations, nostalgic constructions of family and community play the role of narrating and locating a longed-for home. By providing a link between the workings of nostalgia and the construction of home, this volume re-theorizes cultural imaginaries as a source for diasporic community reinvention. Through ethnographic fieldwork and research in folkloristics, Otero reveals that the Aguda identify strongly with their Afro-Cuban roots in contemporary times. Their fluid identity moves from Yoruba to Cuban, and back again, in a manner that illustrates the truly cyclical nature of transnational Atlantic community affiliation. Solimar Otero is assistant professor of English and folklore at Louisiana State University and is research associate and visiting professor at the Women's Studies in Religion Program at the Harvard Divinity School from 2009 - 2010.<br>

  Abstract: In this article I examine the place of religious beliefs, and the interrelation between religion and gender, in a selection of twenty-first-century German-language prose fiction written by women. In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

  Abstract: This book provides the most comprehensive study to date of the full range of Marías' writing, including discussion and analysis of his literary and intellectual formation, his development as a novelist and short story writer, and his unique perspective offered in nearly twenty-five years of newspaper columns on topics ranging from religion to football. Above all, Marías is examined as a writer of fictions. As a translator of several canonical works from English to Spanish, Marías came to appreciate the preciseness of words as well as their ambiguity, their capacity to represent as well as their propensity to distort. The author examines Marías's constant awareness of how language can be used to construct stories as the foundation for engaging the world as well as for imagining it. The nature of Marías's storytelling, and the way in which he imagines, form the principal focus of this Companion. David K.

  Abstract: After Parsonsis a fresh examination of Parsons' theoretical undertaking, its significance for social scientific thought, and its implications for present-day empirical research. The book is divided into four parts: Social Institutions and Social Processes; Societal Community and Modernization; Sociology and Culture; and the Human Condition. The chapters deal with Parsons' notions of societal community, societal evolution, and modernization and modernity.After Parsonsaddresses major themes of enduring relevance, including social differentiation and cultural diversity, social solidarity, universalism and particularism, and trust and affect in social life. The contributors explore these topics in a wide range of social institutions-family and kinship, economy, polity, the law, medicine, art, and religion-and within the context of contemporary developments such as globalization, the power of the United States as an "empireless empire," the emergence of forms of fundamentalism, the upsurge of racial, tribal, and ethnic conflicts, and the increasing occurence of deterministic and positivistic thought.<br>

Such a definition of the system and the cosmos to which it is related is a conception of identity.

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

In other words, utopias have an inherent heterodox tendency, which renders them suspect in the eyes of religious authorities.

Abstract: How might a commitment to political liberalism be maintained when people generally have a greater commitment to their more particular cultural and religious values? This collection of essays would have liberalism compromise from the outset: “A liberal political order needs to somehow find peace with social institutions and practices based on belief and moral tradition ” (p. xii). The contributors propose expanding the role of religion in public life (Jean Bethke Elshtain), inculcating a stronger sense of patriotic citizenship (Walter Berns), and promoting individual virtue (Douglas J. Den Uyl). Many of the essays argue that since religion is the genesis of fundamental liberal ideals, such as equal respect for persons, political liberalism ultimately must rely for its justification on core religious values. This kind of argument is fallacious: we may reasonably hold certain values even if we come to reject a formerly accepted basis for those values. Loss of faith in religious dictates still leaves a prohibition against killing, for instance, with the support of good public reasons.

Abstract: For Immanuel Kant, a foundational figure of liberal Protestantism, the immortality of the soul is a postulate of pure practical reason, and the resurrection of Jesus, a legend in which Saint Paul would not have believed had it not served as a morally necessary proof of a future life. From the moral point of view (to which Kant reduces religion), it is irrelevant whether the terrestrial body is necessary for personal identity in the afterlife or even whether our bodies will be resurrected. See Immanuel Kant,
            The Conflict of the Faculties(1798), trans. Mary J. Gregor (Lincoln, Nebr., 1992), where Kant formulates principles of scriptural exegesis aimed at solving the conflict between the faculties of philosophy and theology.<br>

                     sayabout commonalities inside the group? For instance, do they consider themselves to be members of a preconstituted community that they imagine shares something deep and natural, such as religion or race? Or do they imagine themselves to share just one goal, one interest, and say they are banding together for instrumental purposes? Or do they emphasize that the group is diverse, accepting, embracing of cultural, ethnic, racial, and class differences?<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: After this historical, critical section, Robbins develops a more constructive approach toward a philosophical theology that capitalizes on the ontotheological condition. He claims as his models Paul Ricoeur and, ultimately, Jean‐Luc Marion and Emmanuel Lévinas. Understanding Ricoeur’s hermeneutics “according to the model of religious orthodoxy in which faith and practice translate into knowledge” (p. 123), Robbins praises Ricoeur for offering a model of philosophical theology but criticizes this model because, like all orthodoxy, the philosophy remains uncritical of its foundations—that is, of the religion to which it gives conceptual formulation. Another model of philosophical theology is provided by Marion and Lévinas. In Marion, Robbins asserts, phenomenology and theology each pass into the other in such a way that there is not a confusion or reduction but a mutual criticism and modification of each by the other (p. 113). Marion’s supposed embrace of the ontotheological dialogue between philosophy and theology is foreshadowed, according to Robbins, in Lévinas, who first modeled “an alternative strategy for contemporary philosophical and theological thought … a strategy that is
      otherwise than overcoming” (p. 132).<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: What’s the difference between a “limit” and a “boundary,” and does it make a difference? Does it matter, for example, that
      Grenzenin the title of Immanuel Kant’s major work on the philosophy of religion,Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, is perhaps better translated as “boundaries” and not as “limits”? According to Patrick Bourgeois’s recent book,Philosophy at the Boundary of Reason: Ethics and Postmodernity, much hangs on this distinction. The book pursues three interlocking agendas, each concerning themes of interest to scholars of religion and ethics. The author’s primary agenda is to draw attention to what he sees as a neglected philosophical distinction within the Kantian critical philosophy crucial to a proper interpretation of the notion of the “limit‐boundary of reason” and to the ruinous effects the failure to apprehend this distinction unleashed within twentieth‐century philosophy. Second, he pursues an important new reading of Paul Ricoeur as a philosopher who gets the idea of the limit‐boundary of reason right in his hermeneutical phenomenology. Finally, Bourgeois tries to show how getting the distinction right makes it possible to extricate the positive elements of postmodern ethics (especially Emmanuel Lévinas’s recognition of the ethical claim of alterity) from deconstruction’s false philosophy of limit as closure. In Bourgeois’s view, deconstruction decenters meaning and subjectivity to so large a degree as to render responsible human agency ineffectual.<br>

Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: One can find such a coalescence of subaltern religious representations and creation of a politically solidary narrative via intentional hybridization in the works of the Korean
            minjungpoet Kim Chi Ha (1941– ). Kim’s poetry weaves Catholic liberation theology with the antifeudal and anticolonial social vision of the Tonghak religion, which rose as an indigenous religious movement of peasants for democratic revolution in Korea at the turn of the nineteenth century and played a prominent role in the 3.1 Independence Movement of 1919. The Tonghak religion itself was the product of a coalescence of elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and indigenous beliefs in the subaltern religious and social imagination of the Korean peasantry. In the unfinished talk poem (ballad)The World of Chang Il Tam, one of the works for which he was imprisoned, tortured, and sentenced to life imprisonment by the dictatorial South Korean regime of Park Chung Hee in 1976, Kim merges the symbols of the Eucharist—the mystical body of the deity that is eaten—with the Tonghak teaching of “human being is heaven [in nae chʾǒn]”: “Food is heaven / As we eat / God enters us / Food is heaven. / Oh, food / Should be shared and eaten by all.” See Kim Chi Ha,The Gold‐Crowned Jesus and Other Writings, ed. Chong Sun Kim and Shelly Killen (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1978), 13–39. See also hisSaengmyǒng(Seoul: Sol, 1992), 132–49. Kim’s religiously hybrid poetic vision has been one of the mainsprings of inspiration for South Korea’sminjungtheology.

Abstract: David Tracy examines the tension between literal and metaphorical meaning in Christian religious language in “Metaphor and Religion: The Test Case of Christian Texts,” in
            On Metaphor, ed. Sheldon Sacks (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1979), 89–104. Tracy focuses on two basic expressions: “The Kingdom of God is like” and “God is Love.” “The statement ‘God is Love,’” Tracy writes, “does not say literally what God is butproducesa metaphorical meaning for what God is like” (103). Tracy refers to Paul Ricoeur’s insistence on the concept of tension inThe Rule of Metaphor(trans. Robert Czerny [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000], 247–56). Ricoeur speaks of “theecstaticmoment of language,” which is “the moment ofbelief,of ontological commitment” (249). Ricoeur summarizes the idea of “tension” within metaphorical truth as follows: “There is no other way to do justice to the notion of metaphorical truth than to include the critical incision of the (literal) ‘is not’ within the ontological vehemence of the metaphorical ‘is’” (255).<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: What is particularly intriguing here is Frei’s connection between the “particularistic” practices of reading represented by Midrash and the “cultural future” of civilization. Adherence to the literal sense, through typological practices of reading, thus cultivates a practice and informs a worldview that can resist and challenge the universal, hegemonic tendencies of modernity. As he continues, “The Protestant theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher called Judaism a fossil religion, in part at least out of the animus which many Rationalist, Romantic, and Idealistic thinkers bore toward Jewish particularism. And yet it is now conceivable that that `fossil' may bear more of the future of the culture of the West in its hands than Christianity, and its traditional, particularistic forms may not be adventitious to the fact.” The “fossilization” of Judaism from the perspective of the Enlightenment is well known; moreover, the rejection of Jewish particularism by Rationalism, Romanticism, and Idealism bears a strong resemblance to the simultaneous occlusion of the practice of figural reading so powerfully described in
         Eclipse: “Beyond that, however, the example of Judaism in the modern Western world might be a beacon to a reconstituted Christian community. One never knows what this community might then contribute once again to that culture or its residues, including its political life, its quest for justice and freedom—and even its literature. If the priorities are rightly ordered, the literal sense may be counted on to play a significant part in such a less pretentious enterprise. It will stretch and not break.” As Frei notes, such cultural benefits must be considered “secondary” or “incidental”—yet, this paragraph speaks volumes as to the potentially transformative impact that he envisages through adherence to the literal sense of scripture and attention to its relation to Midrash. Such potential is highly significant, given Frei’s frequent disparagement of allegoric~<br>

Abstract: The most systematic exploration of this ethical reading of the image of God is found in the twelfth‐century Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides. While Maimonides shares with Thomas, as above, the effort to synthesize biblical religion with the ethics of Aristotle, he does not accept Aristotle’s separation of ethics from imitative poetics. Instead, Maimonides argues for an
         imitatio Deior imitation of God as humanity’s highest moral perfection. As he puts it, “The perfection, in which man can truly glory, is attained by him when he has acquired—as far as this is possible for man—the knowledge of God, the knowledge of His Providence, and of the manner in which it influences His creatures in their production and continued existence. Having acquired this knowledge he will then be determined always to seek loving‐kindness, judgment, and righteousness, and thus to imitate the ways of God.”20Imitation clearly does not here mean only the mimesis of the visible world (as for Aristotle). It means, in a more mythic register, acting in the likeness of a God who is prior and primordial, a God who is this visible world’s underlying invisible Creator. Both individuals and the people of God collectively may be defined in part by their primal capability for imitating their Creator’s perfect rest and goodness, for imitating what is deepest within humanity itself as God’s image rather than what is corrupted in historical actuality.<br>

Abstract: The derivation of a formal, consistent, agreed‐upon practical and normative ethics is no mean feat. In actuality, librarianship has, in many ways over many years, aimed at this goal. The LBR, codes of ethics, expressions of core values, and other statements are tangible products of the effort. The commentary on these statements and related ethical concerns is also part of the attempt to articulate a coherent ethical theory. Moreover, the statements and the commentary are marks of progress. They constitute a nascent discourse ethics, but the tacit realm in which they have existed needs to become explicit. A foundation built upon rights does not deny consequences, welfare, or duty, but it does couch ethics in terms of the well‐being of everyone in the community. A strong positive right of access to information is weighed only against the negative liberty of not being subjected to any palpable harm. Acceptance of these rights does constitute something of a social contract. “The contract is a moral bond. It connects the strong and the weak, the lucky and the unlucky, the rich and the poor, creating a union that transcends all differences of interest, drawing its strength from history, culture, religion, language, and so on” [
         39, pp. 82–83]. In connecting the advantaged and the disadvantaged, the library’s responsibility is considerable. It cannot be accomplished dogmatically, and it cannot be ignorant to constitutive rights.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: If the genealogy of responsibility developed by Patočka “follows the traces of a genius of Christianity that is the history of Europe” (
      GD,p. 3), it is precisely because it is only in, or as, Christian Europe that the motif of the care of the soul—the central theme of what is European—is transformed (or, as we will see,couldbe transformed) into a true principle of responsibility. Christianity is the only religion that can secure the possibility of a responsibility that is truly European and at the same time really realize the concept of responsibility. What thus sets Patočka’s reflections on Europe apart from those of Husserl and Heidegger is precisely the significance of religion—particularly, of the religion par excellence that is Christianity.<br>

Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Abstract: In the early twentieth century, the simple thesis of Herder’s historicism was supplanted by a significantly different undertaking. This new historicism held the thesis that the proper study of history demonstrates predictable laws that are universal in nature, thus similar to the empirical sciences. It is this later version of historicism that Karl Popper attacks in
         The Poverty of Historicism. Popper clearly states: “I mean by `historicism’ an approach to the social sciences which assumes that historical prediction is their principal aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the `rhythms’ or the `patterns,’ the `laws’ or the `trends’ that underlie the evolution of history” [75p. 3]. This version of historicism was asserted by many European philosophers and social scientists influenced by Hegel’s dialectical theory of history. Various scholars like Karl Mannheim, Friedrich Meinecke, Ernst Troeltsch, Benedetto Croce, and Arnold Toynbee, among many others, used this version of historicism for generating universal laws that applied to sociology, psychology, political theory, economics, and religion.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Airy theoretical statements like these begin to sound downright saccharine when the subject turns to religion. Consider the following statement: “Presence [oddly, this term is sometimes capitalized by Reynolds, sometimes not] is an inescapable existential presupposition, a kind of eschatological affirmation built into the praxis of availability. … When we encounter the presence of the other, we cannot help but say ‘it is good’” (147). One wants to know how these sentences would be received by a Palestinian attempting to negotiate an Israeli checkpoint or by a student at one of the stricter jihadist‐leaning madrassas in Pakistan. For approximately two pages (150–52), Reynolds dwells on the darker realities of pluralism and difference: violence, mistrust, fear, imperialism, and domination. Undeterred, however, he moves swiftly to “the recovery of trust,” arguing that despite all appearances to the contrary, “religious faith [is] a ‘saving’ performance” that “places us … in a trustworthy and gratuitous ultimate environment, one that resists falsification by the conditions of finitude” (158). One senses that reality is not receiving due attention.<br>

Abstract: Other events, celebrations, and sorrows, religious and otherwise, could be mentioned. Again, all of these—and much, much more—form the structures and dynamics within which people dwell and that pose the basic question of how we can and ought to orient life. What then is the aim of intellectual labor? How can knowledge grow so that life might increase, especially in our age when so many forms of life and cultural forms are endangered? Is it possible to rejuvenate the humanities and to probe the religions in order to envision a new self‐overcoming of human power and knowledge into responsibility for the integrity of life within the complexity of the world? That is the work of humanizing religion.<br>

Abstract: In providing clarification of previous works,
   Reflections on the Justis exceptionally helpful. Of particular interest in this volume is the paradoxical nature of authority—What is authority? How is it legitimated? Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: Susanne Mrozik’s
      Virtuous Bodiesrepresents a significant contribution to this current rethinking of religion and Buddhist studies. The author explicitly locates her approach within the interdisciplinary field of feminist studies while also effectively placing the subject of her analysis, Śāntideva’sCompendium of Training(Śikṣ āsamuccaya), in dialogue with the work of such scholars as Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Grosz, Paul Ricoeur, and Charles Hallisey. In one respect, this study can be seen as quite traditional: the author develops her argument through a close reading of an influential Buddhist text, paying careful attention to the subtleties of its Sanskrit vocabulary and attempting to situate it within the medieval North Indian monastic milieu within which it took shape. This textual analysis provides the basis on which Mrozik advances toward the first stated goal of her work, to correct “the widespread misconception in scholarship on Buddhism and Buddhist ethics that South Asian Buddhists (with the exception of practitioners of Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism) ascribed little value to bodies” (6). And Mrozik succeeds admirably in this regard, skillfully articulating how diverse and often seemingly contradictory perspectives on human embodiment come together in support of a religious ideal in which the “bodied being” (ātmabhāva) of bodhisattvas, interacting with the bodies of those whom they aim to liberate, plays a foundational role. Having first identified two dominant and contrasting somatic discourses in theCompendium of Training, one “physiomoral” and the other “ascetic,” Mrozik argues that the text presents a coherent ethical perspective, one in which “an ascetic discourse is in service of producing a range of virtuous bodied beings, valued for their physical as well as moral qualities” (116). As she notes, ascetic disciplines are grounded in an implicit assumption that embodiment matters greatly, even if these disciplines or “technologies of the self” ~<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: The claim that Joyce is the culmination of Christian epic is less persuasive, and part 2 relies too heavily on the work of Gian Balsamo and Altizer. Franke’s contribution is to interpret linguistic repetition in
      Finnegans Wake(London, 1939) as a secular reformulation of negative theology and typology that cannot be definitively interpreted as the death of God. However, I suspect Franke accepts a historical trajectory in which secular literature displaces traditional religion as revelation. If anything, his theological interpretation of Celan, Stevens, and Joyce deconstructs our conventional notion of the secular and demonstrates that literature cannot escape theology. My concern is that we must be careful not to privilege such literature—as the fulfillment of literary or theological tradition—but recognize that Joyce speaks theologically as one voice among many. In short, Franke needs to clarify the role of Joyce in his theoretical argument about poetic language and his practical effort to promote meaningful dialogue. Presumably, Joyce illustrates the apocalyptic power of literature, but does he do so in a way that is representative or superlative in literary or theological terms?<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: D'Holbach's caveat is essential for understanding the implications of his system for the relationship between person and nature, but also between the transcendent and the immanent. If nature is meant to assume the role once assigned to the divine in Christian theology, it does so in an entirely different manner—not as an all-knowing, all-powerful subject, but as a blind and will-less force. At the same time, the human person is both identified with and in large part reduced to an effect of this force. D'Holbach's abandonment of transcendence in his materialist system thus drastically altered the relationship between God and soul as it was understood in orthodox religion. What had been an exchange between two distinct, albeit unequal persons, was reduced to an arrangement between two objects. The meaning of immanence likewise changed. Once mainline Christian theology began to assert the self's inward transcendence vis-à-vis the world as “masters and possessors of nature” (to cite Descartes), atheist philosophes such as d'Holbach reacted by asserting the immanent power of things to dispossess the self in order to repudiate the concept of divinity that stood behind it. However, this was no mere reversion to the world of “enchantment.” While d'Holbach was momentarily willing to anthropomorphize nature for rhetorical effect, he and Spinoza persistently applied the mechanized organization of the universe to human beings as well. In lieu of the semitranscendent, personified objects of the enchanted universe, one was left with the prospect of a world inhabited by wholly immanent, objectified entities.<br>

Abstract: I wanted to keep coming back to Florida until I could see one. The reason was not that I love orchids. I don't even especially
               likeorchids. What I wanted was to see this thing that people were drawn to in such a singular and powerful way. Everyone I was meeting connected to the orchid poaching had circled their lives around some great desire—Laroche had his crazy inspirations and orchid lovers had their intense devotion to their flowers and the Seminoles had their burning dedication to their history and culture—a desire that then answered questions for them about how to spend their time and their money and who their friends would be and where they would travel and what they did when they got there. It was religion. I wanted to want something as much as people wanted these plants, but it isn't part of my constitution. I think people my age are embarrassed by too much enthusiasm and believe that too much passion about anything is naive. I suppose I do have one unembarrassing passion—I want to know what it feels like to care about something passionately. [OT, pp. 40–41]<br>

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Abstract: In sum: while it has it flaws, this book is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the field of theories of religion around. It is worth the cover price for that alone, which makes it definitely recommendable. Those who want to learn about the current state of theory, especially if they tend in the realist direction, will find this book very useful. Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Journal Title: Current Anthropology<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 668652<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: David Parkin identifies and endorses two points critical to my argument, namely, the methodological principle that “the boundaries of the positive are predicated on the definitional challenges of the negative,” and the recognition that “evil is existentially present even if not amenable to set identification.” He refers to my observation that he purposefully excluded witchcraft from themes treated in
         The Anthropology of Eviland accepts my rationale for examining it here. It just may be that when his volume appeared nearly 30 years ago witchcraft was too obvious a place to look for evil, whereas to me it appeared a useful topic to revisit, given current intellectual considerations concerning morality. Interestingly, once Parkin accepts witchcraft as exemplary of human evil, as a move to demystify and de-theologize the category, he himself takes the next step of reintroducing evil conceived supernaturally and how it displaces culpability. The questions of whether evil attacks humans or lies among humans, and of whether evil is other than human or an extension of the human, call into question the boundaries of humanity. Independently of whether morality is divinely ordained or whether religion and morality are conceived as coterminous, the space between human and nonhuman is one of both moral and religious ambiguity. Witches may be something less than human, spirits may be in some respects like people and in others like animals, djinn may be like people except made of fire and air while we are made of earth and water, and angels or devils inhabit a preternatural world somewhere between the natural and supernatural.<br>

Journal Title: The American Historical Review<br>
Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
Issue: 526084<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Journal Title: Renaissance Quarterly<br>
Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
Issue: 594996<br>
Date: 6 2, 2005<br>
Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: The chapters that follow work out these dynamics in a variety of settings. The word
      investmentis a leitmotif, and she first tracks it through Shakespeare’sHenry IVandHamlet, where it tangles together “clothing, commerce, and religion” (35), preparing us for the deep puns at the heart of the Vestiarian Controversy. Chapters on the metaphoricity of the sacrament and on John Donne treat theological questions and, particularly with Donne, “the danger that I [the critic] will find creative metaphor — the magician’s fictive art — where a Renaissance reader would find an assertion of code” (70). A closely argued chapter on classical rhetoric shows how some English translations of Cicero and Quintilian suggest a sharper distinction between metaphor and catachresis than the Romans were willing to make. The productivity of metaphor, to the point of abuse, is deep in the tradition.<br>

Abstract: This essay addresses the problematical nature of the meaning of religion as it is related to the formation and destiny of peoples of African descent in the United States. Moving beyond a narrow understanding of the nature of religion as expressed in much of Black Theology, for example, this essay proposes a "thick" and complex depiction of religion in the African American context through a recognition of its relationship to the contact and conquest that marked the modern world.<br>

Publisher: The University of California Press<br>
Issue: nr.2012.16.issue-1<br>
Date: 8 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Drawing on my own fieldwork experiences with the transnational Integral Yoga community, this essay offers some reflections on two possible approaches to bridging insider-outsider perspectives in the study of new religious movements. First, I consider Gerald Larson's suggestion of a “relationship of mutual reciprocity” between researcher and religious community. Second, I discuss the value of a participatory approach that attempts to integrate engaged participation with critical distance in the study of religion. I use my collaborative experience co-authoring an academic article on Sri Aurobindo and the contemporary yoga scene with an Integral Yoga practitioner to argue that while Larson's reciprocal enterprise risks either sacrificing critical concerns to apologetic agendas, or polarizing the insider as apologetic and the outsider as reductive, a participatory approach proposes a way to put insider-outsider perspectives into a more creative relation.<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Abstract: Bainbridge and Stark's essay on "The Consciousness Reformation" illustrates conceptual and theoretical ambiguities characteristic of research in the scientific study of religion more generally. This paper traces these ambiguities to the presence of two competing, but poorly differentiated, epistemological traditions. An examination of the assumptions implicit within each of these traditions provides a basis for clarifying the distinction between religious symbolism and religious belief, the concept of meaning, the difference between consistency as an attribute of belief and coherence as an attribute of reality, and the role of interpersonal bonds in maintaining the plausibility of religious symbolism. An emerging third perspective that appears to circumvent some of the limitations of the two major epistemological traditions is also discussed.<br>

Abstract: Methods of studying religion can be divided into those which help the investigator "understand" religion from the believer's standpoint and those which "explain" religion in the terms of the sciences. Yet despite the contemporary polemics, these methods need not be alienated from one another. Applying the hermeneutic theory of Paul Ricoeur we can see that the study of religion involves us in an act of interpretation which necessarily requires both methods of understanding and explanation. Ricoeur's theory is employed to show how these methods can be systematically used in tandem so that the most adequate interpretation of the religious world is produced.<br>

Article Title: Against Wholeness: The Ego's Complicity in Religion<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Vergote Volney P.<br>
Abstract: Many students of religion suggest that wholeness or the attainment of an integrated self is an especially valuable goal whose attainment marks a moment of religious insight. Theoreticians like Jung, Allport, and Maslow strongly support this belief. Freud does not. To reconcile the two camps one must either drop Freud altogether or confine his critique of religion to an attack upon neurotic religion, or more exactly, religion based upon superego functioning. One could then claim that healthy religion is a function of the ego, e.g., the ego's tendency towards integrated functioning and the attainment of 'wholeness'. I argue that this ploy, which is itself a function of an egosyntonic desire for wholeness, is altogether wrong. It misrepresents Freud's ego psychology and it therefore misrepresents his critique of the ego's role in religion as well. First, his theoretical, as opposed to his literary, critique of religion is also a critique of certain characteristics of the ego. Second, these characteristics, especially the ego-syntonic drive towards feelings of wholeness, are functions of the ego's obedience to repetition compulsion. Third, the later texts on religion cannot be understood apart from their roots in Freud's earliest theory of ego functioning, especially the physicalist program he developed in his "Project" of 1895. The ego creates and takes part in religious dramas which present an illusory world of wholeness and completion of self. But as the seat of reality testing it must pierce the veils as quickly and as repeatedly as it weaves them.<br>

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroast~<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Abstract: The focus of contemporary studies in religion on methodology can be explored as the recognition of a fundamental epistemological problem. This paper is first an acknowledgment that we do not have an adequate conceptuality to render intelligible inward turning and then an experiment with the meaning of intelligibility. The dispossession of consciousness as the sole place and origin of meaning constituting an intellectual aporia is presented as an experience of the subversion of the subject by the discovery of the unconscious in depth psychologies and the discovery of the transcendence of the subject in foundational theologies. Taking account of this duplex expression of what lingers in disguise behind the scripts of ordinary life is defined as a fundamental exigency in the further development of human understanding and theological reflection.<br>

Article Title: Was Freud a Medical Scientist or a Social Theorist? The Mysterious "Development of the Hero"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i273563<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Yerushalmi Howard L.<br>
Abstract: Rather than viewing Freud as a presumptuous Viennese physician who late in life attempted to "apply" some of his provocative psychological speculations to various social phenomena, this essay argues that from first to last, Freud was a social theorist. Indeed, what drew Freud to the study of biology and medicine was precisely the hope of addressing scientifically the most fundamental cultural problems: the nature of man and his culture; the origins of religion, morality, and tradition and the nature of their extraordinary power; the sources of social order and disorder; the direction of contemporary cultural development; and, finally, the problem of how to live in a disenchanted and psychologically impoverished world. Reading Freud in this manner moves his "cultural" texts from the periphery to the center of his work and makes possible an appreciation of the more complex, coherent, and illuminating social theory that lies at its heart.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i20008321<br>
Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Jantzen Grace M.<br>
Abstract: Paul Helm's discussion of my book is a clear illustration of some of my central claims about Anglo-American philosophy of religion: he instantiates its undue preoccupation with beliefs, and its erasure of gender. In my reply I show how Helm conflates my objection to such preoccupation with the absurd claim that beliefs are unnecessary, and how he conflates philosophy of religion -- even rationality itself -- with its Anglo-American variants. He refuses to engage with the masculinism implicit both in his selectivity and in the boundaries he seeks to maintain around the discipline; boundaries which, I argue, need to be opened up for philosophy of religion to flourish.<br>

Author(s): Lemel Yannick<br>
Abstract: Les théories de la modernisation proposées dans les années cinquante et soixante avançaient l'idée que les sociétés convergeaient vers les valeurs modernes et abandonnaient progressivement leurs valeurs traditionnelles. Cette idée de convergence est réexaminée dans cet article, dans le contexte des seules sociétés européennes, à partir de l'exploitation des enquêtes Valeurs. Une série d'échelles d'attitudes sont construites, puis analysées par des techniques multivariées. Deux résultats principaux se dégagent de cette étude. Tout d'abord, il apparaît que, quelle que soit la date ou les pays examinés, les valeurs des Européens se structurent toujours autour d'un axe de traditionalisme. Un tel résultat est évidemment en contradiction avec les thèses, fortement critiquées par ailleurs, de convergence vers la modernité. Ce résultat est aussi l'occasion de réfléchir sur le pendant du traditionalisme -- faut-il l'appeler "modernité"? -- et sur les liens entre les attitudes économiques et les attitudes morales. En second lieu, la religiosité est étroitement liée à cette structuration des valeurs, mais elle oppose principalement les Européens affiliés à une religion quelle qu'elle soit aux sans-religion, plutôt que -- comme on l'imagine souvent -- les catholiques aux protestants. Au total, la tension entre tradition et modernité reste au cœur du système de valeurs des sociétés européennes. /// The modernization theories developed in the 1950s and 60s put forward the idea that societies were converging toward modern values and gradually abandoning their traditional values. Using data from the Values surveys, the article reexamines the convergence idea in the context of European societies. A set of attitude scales was constructed, then analyzed using multivariate techniques. Analysis yielded two main results. First, regardless of date or country examined, Europeans' values seem still to be structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously runs counter to converge~<br>

Author(s): Gniffke Franz<br>
Abstract: Am wertvollsten, was die Ausbreitung des von Kant verarbeiteten Materials wie der Paral-
lelen bei Kant selbst betrifft, ist m. E. immer noch das umfangreiche Werk von Josef Boha-
tec (Die Religionsphilosophie Kants in der „Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der bloßen
Vernunft”, Hamburg 1938. Zum „Mut. Anf.” vgl. 191-224). Ihm folgt im wesentlichen
Friedrich Billicsich (Das Problem des Übels in der Philosophie des Abendlandes, Bd. II:
Von Eckehart bis Hegel, Wien und Köln 1952. Zu Kant 220-250). Doch werden von ihnen
so wenig wie von Klaus Weyand (Kants Geschichtsphilosophie. Ihre Entwicklung und ihr
Verhältnis zur Aufklärung, Kant-Studien-Erg. 85, Köln 1963) die Entwicklungsschritte im
Gebrauch der praktischen Vernunft im einzelnen interpretiert. Weyand gibt den Inhalt
kurz (129-131), um dann den Stellenwert dieser Schrift im geschichtsphilosophichen Den-
ken Kants zu verdeutlichen (bis 136). Ähnlich vor ihm Paul Menzer (Kants Lehre von der
Entwicklung in Natur und Geschichte, Berlin 1911, 280-284). Nach Abschluß des Manus-
kripts ist erschienen: Text und Applikation, hrsg. v. M. Fuhrmann, H. R. Jauß, W. Pan-
nenberg (Poetik und Hermeneutik IX), München 1981; die Beiträge des ersten Teiles
(15-127) beschäftigen sich mit der vielfältigen Wirkungsgeschichte von Gen. 3.<br>

Abstract: Separare in modo sostanziale (e cioè non a fini di indagine puntúale) l'ambito religioso
da quello politico sarebbe come dividere la topografia dell'agorà in due parti distinte, una
religiosa, con templi ed altari, ed una amministrativo-politica.
Una separazione del genere corrisponderebbe a un falso storico, essendo gli edifici religio-
si e politici non soltanto interconnessi nello spazio ma spesso coincidenti (dal Bouleuterion-
Metroon alla Tholos-Prytanikon). Una delle migliori trattazioni di questa interconnessione
è proprio C. Sourvinou-Inwood, 'What is Polis Religion?', in O. Murray and S. Price (eds.),
The Greek City. From Homer to Alexander, Oxford 1990, pp. 295-322 e "Further Aspects of Polis
Religion", AION Arch. 10, 1988, pp. 259-274.<br>

Abstract: L'allégorie de la Religion (embl. XXXIX/XXXV), déjà évoquée dans la note 31, va aussi
dans le sens de cette hypothèse: l'autonomie du texte par rapport à l'image est ici prou-
vée, si besoin était, par le fait que ce poème figure dans les Poëmata sous le titre «Vera
Religio» depuis 1569 et que ce n'est que dans l'édition de 1599 qu'il disparaît définiti-
vement de la section intitulée «Icones» pour ne se trouver désormais plus que dans les
Emblemata (F. Gardy, op. cit., p. 13). Ce même emblème (texte français, avec gravure)
figure déjà dans certaines éditions de la Confession de la foy chrestienne de 1561 (cf.
F. Gardy, ibid., p. 65 ; A. Saunders, op. cit., p. 242; Dufour (Alain), «Théodore de Bèze»,
Histoire littéraire de la France, t. XLII, Paris, 1995-2002, pp. 347-350). A noter que la
structure de cet emblème diffère fortement de la plupart des autres : un jeu de questions-
réponses présenté sous forme de dialogue fictif entre un je et Religion permet d'éviter
toute lourdeur descriptive (cf. également l'emblème XXVIII/XXVI et A. M. Saunders,
art. cit., pp. 63-64).<br>

Author(s): Boer Roland<br>
Abstract: Focusing on the interplay of religion and Utopia in Fredric Jameson's recent Archaeologies of the Future, I identify a tension: on the one hand, the content of religion has been superseded (although not its forms), yet, on the other, Jameson still wishes to make use of a hermeneutics of suspicion and recovery in which even the most retrograde material may be recuperated—religion included. So we find a clash underway in this work. Sometimes Jameson sidelines religion, as one would expect if religion was no longer relevant. At other times, he exercises his dialectical hermeneutics, particularly at two moments: first, a recovery, via Feuerbach, of the role of magic within fantasy literature; second, the partial treatment of apocalyptic, which comes very close to his own argument for Utopia as rupture. From here, I develop the dialectic of ideology and Utopia further by expanding Jameson's comments on the possibilities of medieval theology and the utopian role of religion (both Catholic and Protestant) in More's Utopia.<br>

Abstract: The article analyzes the theoretical reflection of religion throught Durkheim's production from the initial perspectives to The elementary forms of religious life. In his masterpiece particularly, Durkheim presents the most important factors founding a `religious society': the experience of the sacred, the emotional proprieties of rituals and the trascendental function of symbolism. The essay critically discusses, both in sociological and in philosophic terms, potentialities and limits of Durkheim's project.<br>

Abstract: Das Video, zu finden unter http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=aL0GQxx4v_w (fur den
Hinweis danken die Autorinnen Peter Koch) wurde von der englischsprachigen Nut-
zerin/dem Nutzer bereits zwei Tage spater, am 28. August 2006, hochgeladen und mit
folgendem Kommentar versehen: „Just a few pictures from my trip to the Dachau
Concentration Camp in Dachau, Germany. I cannot explain the emotions that I was
having while visiting a place where thousands lost their lives, not because they were evil,
not because they were criminals, but because of their race, religion, orientation, etc... It
seems I am constantly confronted with the fact that the human race is capable of such
mass atrocities. Why is it that one person or group of people must assert their beliefs and
their cause on another, often to the death." Von Interesse sind hier auch die Reaktionen
derer, die das Video auf Youtube besichtigt und kommentiert haben. In einem solchen
Kommentar ist kritisch von einem „romantischen Video" die Rede, mit dem Hinweis: „it
is a place with very bad karma!"<br>

Author(s): Wright Peter Matthews<br>
Abstract: Jonathan Z. Smith's essay "Map Is Not Territory" was a watershed event in the academic study of religion, but, this author contends, for reasons yet to be adequately addressed by the discipline. Indeed, as argued in this essay, Smith's "Map" is best understood as a Romantic manifesto performed in a register indebted to Wordsworth and Wallace Stevens (following such precursors as Kant, Coleridge, and Ralph Waldo Emerson) as opposed to the Romantic register of Mircea Eliade (which was much indebted to the late German Romanticism of Hegel). Consequently, to practice the academic study of religion in a manner consistent with Smith's intervention involves a specifically Romantic mode of literary engagement with the textual remains by which one traces the careers of myth, ritual, and experiences of transformation among individuals and groups.<br>

Publisher: Hebrew Union College<br>
Issue: i23503346<br>

Author(s): TOWNER W. SIBLEY<br>
Abstract: Every community which regards as normative certain texts given by the worthies of old must develop a "hermeneutic," a means whereby these fixed standards can be kept in an effective relationship with the ever-changing frontier of day-to-day experience. In the two centuries surounding the turn of the era, six factors impelled Rabbinic Judaism toward the elaboration of a hermeneutic far more self-conscious than anything previously known: the canon of the Scripture was fixed; a body of authoritative Torah not part of that canon had to be kept in fruitful relationship to it; the institutions of Bet-Kenesset and Bet-Midrash emerged as settings suitable for carrying on the hermeneutical task; sectarian competition increased the urgency for an explicit hermeneutic; Hellenistic culture offered models from its own interpretive tradition; and the normative role of the Temple in religion ceased. Out of this period emerged a sophisticated system of "hermeneutics," or praxis of interpretation. The essay reviews the traditional lists of seven and thirteen middot, together with other methodological devices not part of the lists, and — with the help of illustrations drawn from Mekilta de R. Ishmael — offers a logical and literary analysis of each one. A comparison of the results of these analyses with hermeneutical devices found in both Old and New Testaments and in the larger Hellenistic milieu leads to the conclusion that the system of Rabbinic hermeneutics was sui generis, and was the indigenous response of the Tannaim and their immediate successors to their own urgently felt need for an effective hermeneutic.<br>

Abstract: No one owns the concept 'culture' Anthropology's long-standing proprietary claim on the concept rests on three sorts of contentions — none of which are convincing Anthropology's overwhelmingly interpretive approaches to cultural materials have led to a preoccupation with the details of cultural materials at the expense of formulating explanatory theories This has, among other things, rendered fieldwork experience sufficient for professional credentials However, if the details are all that matter, then comparative and cross-cultural research, as well as most of the social sciences, make no sense Contrary to this view, it is proposed here that theories reveal which details matter Cognitive accounts of the sort we advanced in Rethinking Religion (1990) offer a firm theoretical basis for cross-cultural study of religious materials Other types of research concerning non-human primates, early childhood development, and various social and cognitive impairments also offer insight into culture (without relying on fieldwork studies)<br>

Article Title: "I DON'T DO SYSTEMS": AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ<br>
Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23548454<br>
Date: 1 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): GEERTZ CLIFFORD<br>
Abstract: I had the honor of interviewing Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, USA, on October 18, 2000. The interview focused on Geertz's theoretical conceptions, the tradition on which he draws, the critique he has encountered, and on interpretive anthropology's future development. Of particular interest was the clarification of his much-debated method, his definition of symbol and his famous definition of religion as a cultural system. Geertz emphasizes his attempt to exercise an applied pragmatic phenomenological and hermeneutical method without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenomenology, or culture. He maintains that he only has a conceptual framework inspired by different scholars, which nevertheless has consistent focus and perspective, i.e., meaning and symbol. In relationship to this, Geertz defines his symbol within the Peircean semiotic tradition. Therefore, the term symbol is understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes a symbol via a cultural interpretation. Furthermore, his definition of religion as a cultural system is, in his view, a non-essentialistic definition and therefore is not—as Talal Asad claims—ethnocentric. Although it is Geertz's opinion that interpretive anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism, he predicts that interpretive anthropology's future development will be in reasonable continuity with its past. In my closing comments I tentatively suggest that Geertz may have a theory of interpretation because of his definition of the symbol, his unavoidable assumptions, and his unique method, which has the capacity of grasping the cultural specific in a general way.<br>

Issue: i23548563<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Vásquez Manuel A.<br>
Abstract: This essay offers some theoretical and methodological reflections on how the study of religion might look if we were to assume that complexity, connectivity, and fluidity are preponderant features of our present age, without ignoring the strong countervailing global logics of segregation, surveillance, and control. After characterizing transnational, global, and diasporic modalities of religion in motion, the essay explores the strengths and weaknesses of the analytical tools of flows, landscapes, and networks in the study of mobility. I argue that by placing power front and center, the concept of networks provides a necessary corrective to hydraulic models of flows and spatial metaphors of landscapes. These metaphors tend to overstate the pervasiveness of porous boundaries and movement or to privilege the hermeneutic and phenomenological dimensions of religious activity.<br>

Author(s): KUBÁLKOVÁ VENDULKA<br>
Abstract: The Anglo-American discipline of International Relations defends its main principles and resists with an almost religious fervor any change to them, although the explanation of world affairs has been eluding it since its inception. The article attempts to draw up possibly the first historiography of the IR scholarship about religion in world affairs since the 90s, showing the heightened interest in the subject from most other social sciences and humanities. The article proposes the use of the term 'International Political Theology' to bridge the multiple literatures as well as to underscore the theological commitment of the IR discipline to its basic creeds and dogmas.<br>

Publisher: INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<br>
Issue: i23615225<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): HANSKA JAN<br>
Abstract: This article concerns itself with establishing and defining the concept of prophetic politics as a narrative-based political leadership. It focuses on the use of religious, mythical and otherwise culturally dominating narratives which are often taken for granted or as 'common sense.' By a skilful politician, these stories can be given new forms and used as tools of leadership. This article explores the differences between traditional prophesies in the religious context and political prophesies and shows how with the use of prophetic narratives the politician is able to keep politics from stagnation since every moment and every decision can be endowed with special importance in actualizing the vision that remains the fascinating but elusive goal of politics - whatever it is narrated to be. This might re-invigorate the citizens to participate more in politics. The focus of the article is on American politics since the American civil religion and the narrative tradition of the jeremiad provide ample tools for political prophets, but the concept is not restricted solely to America. I argue that well told narratives have great influence on how people think and that can be manipulated politically. This type of leadership opens new vistas for political candidates, but it also opens new vistas for researchers to use in their study of politics.<br>

Abstract: Abordaremos a autobiografia de Malcolm X (1925-1965) sob o prisma de uma hermenêutica do testemunho: ao aplicar a hermenêutica do testemunho na referida autobiografia, identificaremos as duas profundas transformações psicológicas e espirituais sofridas por Malcolm X, transformações indissociáveis de uma mudança na sua relação com a transcendência, o Islamismo e a comunidade afro-americana do seu tempo. Trata-se, em última análise, de percorrer a evolução de uma consciência humana que se cumpre e se manifesta na religiosidade (não-violência) e no testemunho. Neste estudo, o rito aparecerá como "passagem" no contexto da (re-)integração e (re)educação segundo o modelo da adoração (Mestre/discípulo), mediada pelo desejo mimético, cuja função é purgativa e fundacional porque reorientadora da existência do discípulo. O rito será visto ainda como "sinal da aceitação do testemunho". No contexto de testemunho, extrairemos ainda uma noção de coragem, integrante de noções contemporâneas. We will approach the autobiography of Malcolm X (1925-1965) from the point of view of a hermeneutics of testimony: on applying the hermeneutics of testimony in the said autobiography, we will identify the two deep psychological and spiritual transformations suffered by Malcolm X, transformations that can't be separated from a change in his relationship with the transcendence; the Islamism and the African American community of his time, being, ultimately, the go through of the evolution of human consciousness that meets and manifests itself in religion (non-violence) and witness. In this study, the rite will appear as "passage" in the context of (re-) integration and (re-)education according to the model of worship (master/disciple), taking part in the mimetic desire, whose function is purgative and functional because reorienting the existence of the disciple, the rite is still seen as "a sign of acceptance of the witness." Even in the context of testimony, we will demonstrate a sense of courag~<br>

Publisher: AKADÉMIAI KIADÓ<br>
Issue: i23656603<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Simon Róbert<br>
Abstract: The different approaches to the problem of sin frequently attributed to it an ethical connotation which would have assigned its role and place even in the history of religions. These approaches supposed implicitly a closer or looser connection between religion and ethics. The present author's historico-philological investigation, after having compared some basic linguistic and historical data of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, came to the conclusion that the early forms of the sin perceptions had not yet belonged to the sphere of ethics, while those forms which developed in early modern times have not become part of ethics. Evil and sin were originally associated with religion, later on, however, the judgement of sins has been taken over by the secularised law.<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Abstract: This is based on research that has discovered crucial, hitherto unknown biographical information. First, I review the theories of authors who helped to generate the whole 'affair' of Durkheim's two pre-names, most often in seeing it as a way to interrogate his relation with Judaism. Next, I discuss how the issue comes with elements that are incomplete or inexact. It is then to present new evidence of Durkheim's ambivalence and changing attitude towards his first, identifiably Jewish pre-name. The census records during his time at Bordeaux show that he registered himself as 'David' in 1891 and 1896, but abandoned this and switched to 'Émile' in 1901. Accordingly, I examine possible interpretations of the change, in terms of the political context of the Dreyfus Affair, events in his family life, his institutional position, his growing reputation, and a programme of research in which he resolved on a scientific treatment of religion.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23918936<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Westerink Herman<br>
Abstract: In this article it is argued that the apparent vagueness and broadness of the concept 'spirituality' and the difficulty in finding an agreeable definition for it are related to the different meanings of the concept within different intellectual and religious contexts and, subsequently, to different valuations of spirituality in relation to religion and lived religiosity. This article also examines the concept spirituality in the context of the psychology of religion's historical entanglement with theology. On the one hand, the psychology of religion has emancipated itself from theological discourse and theological institutions. On the other hand, the psychology of religion is still closely connected to a modernist theological project of founding religiousness in a province of the mind that resists religious critique of traditional contents and institutional structures in a secular era. The author pleas for more differentiation between theistic and non-theistic dimensions of the concept spirituality.<br>

Author(s): Britt Brian<br>
Abstract: In spite of limited resources, intellectual diversity, and arguments that texts are overrated as a method and object of study, this essay argues that religion and literature maintains a vital and even subversive identity by its commitment to the text. After challenging Lawrence Sullivan's argument against the 'tyranny of the text' in religious studies, I sketch three dimensions of texts that concern religion and literature as I see it: the aesthetic, the critical, and the transcendental. With an emphasis on the subversive function of religion and literature, I apply a hermeneutic of suspicion to these dimensions of text through two metaphors: the wig (la perruque) and the veil.<br>

Author(s): Wallace Cynthia R.<br>
Abstract: Religious echoes are resonant with race and gender in Beloved, raising questions best posed in a psychoanalytic register. Freud's sceptical questioning of religion is important for a consideration of the gendered, raced, and specifically religious subjectivities explored in the novel, as is Lacan's paradigm of entry into the symbolic order. Reading the religious in Beloved in light of both Freud and Lacan, and reading the poetically evocative Word in all three, I locate within the novel a profound ambivalence, an awareness of the limitations of language under the Name of the Father and the necessity—even potential good—of imagining within its system.<br>

Author(s): Wriglesworth Chad<br>
Abstract: This essay outlines and illustrates ways that 'theological humanism' provides methodological possibilities for scholars working in religion and literary studies. I suggest there is a need to investigate more humanistic methods of interpreting literature by exploring approaches that engage questions of sacred depth. After stressing the necessary paradoxes of theological humanism as an interpretive and lived stance in the world, I offer a reading of Margaret Edson's Wit that is shaped by these principles.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917944<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Ward Graham<br>
Abstract: Having defined how 'secular' is to be understood in this context, this essay explores two sets of observations. The first concerns the relationship between religion and literature as cultural products of a specific cultural imaginary. Both are fundamentally associated with narrative, which, as even contemporary neuroscience demonstrates, continually attempts to make sense of the world. Both are narratives in which there is a reflection upon, and a performance of, creativity. Since the cultural imaginary has been shaped historically by the religious, then all reflections upon creating are coloured by the sacred. The second set of observations issues from the first and concerns the relationship between authorial standpoint and literary creation. The essay examines authorial intention, the nature of language and the operation of the imagination as each relates to the cultural imaginary and the act of 'making believe'. The two sets of observations and their examination demonstrate the ways in which literature continually resists secularity.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922202<br>
Date: 9 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Hass Andrew W.<br>
Abstract: The following essay explores the nature of theory within the interdisciplinary space we call literature and theology—or more generally religion and literature—and the role theory has played in that space's collective practice. It argues that theory is natural to the 'binding' of religion with literature and of literature with religion, since both are caught in a dilemma of reading, including the 'reading' of the practices that mark each of their respective disciplines. The discussion then looks at the spectatorial nature of the ancient notion of theory as theoria, before it traces how theory, in moving from theoria to high Theory, has figured in the 25 volumes of Literature and Theology itself. This tracing covers a double assumption of theory and an appropriation of the 'other' as theory. The essay concludes by looking at the dynamic that continues to bind literature and theology, and indeed the readers of a journal such as this one, in a communality of theory, practice, and interpretation.<br>

Article Title: "Money is the Filial Child. But, at the same time, it is also the Enemy!": Korean Shamanic Rituals for Luck and Fortune<br>
Publisher: Institute for the Study of Religion<br>
Issue: i23942764<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Park Jun Hwan<br>
Abstract: In the world of Korean shamanism, there is a particular god, called taegam, which is allegedly famous for its love of money and its abundance of greed for material wealth. During the shamanic ritual of chaesu-kut, the rites for good fortune and luck, this god is popularly worshipped as the Deity of Wealth and is typically symbolized by money placed all over its face and spirit costumes. Nonetheless, as money has the two sides of heads and tails, taegam also has two very different faces—so-taegam and taegam. This article explores the ambiguity of the two taegam gods, focusing on the symbolic action of money-offerings and how its meaning is taken from the perspective of the ritual actors, in the hope of shedding light on the place of Korea's traditional popular religion of shamanism in today's transformed urban landscape. By discussing the semantics of "money is the filial child" (a remark made by so-taegam) and "money is the enemy" (as remarked by taegam), statements I often heard during my fieldwork in Seoul, I suggest that the ambivalent symbolic nature of taegam should be seen as an indispensible vehicle for understanding ritual life, as well as everyday life, of urban Korean people since it is closely related to both normative orientations and the contradictory aspects of the material culture of contemporary urbanites inhabiting the borderless, globalized, and fluctuating modern capitalist market. This conclusion is reached partly with reference to existing sociological theories of money and anthropological inquiries into the ambivalent aspects of taegam.<br>

entre la religion et l'État. À noter qu'indépendamment de ces opinions, une majorité écrasante
de juifs israéliens maintient des pratiques religieuses.<br>

Author(s): Giraud Michel<br>
Abstract: Une telle originalité est un fait général qui est depuis longtemps connu et reconnu par
ceux qui étudient les dynamiques culturelles des populations issues de l'immigration. Ainsi
Olivier Roy écrit : « L'ethnicité à la française [celle des "Blacks" et des "Beurs"] n'est pas la
reconstitution et la projection sur le territoire français de groupes ethniques importés, mais la
fabrication après coup de groupes ethniques à partir d'éléments qui, venus de pays différents,
dépourvus de toute homogénéité culturelle, s'inventent à partir du regard que les autres portent
sur eux et qui souvent repose sur un seul trait différenciatif (religion, physique), une "sous-
culture" moderne... » (0. Roy, «Ethnicité, bandes et communautarisme», Esprit, «La France
des banlieues », février 1991, p. 39-40).<br>

Abstract: Ces deux affirmations ne sont nullement inconciliables. Paul Bicœur, dont on a vu qu'il
plaidait pour une herméneutique biblique requérant l'exercice de l'imaginaire, a aussi défendu
l'idée d'une foi irréductible à ses manifestations religieuses (voir, par exemple, « Religion,
athéisme, foi », dans le Conflit des interprétations, Paris, Le Seuil, 1969).<br>

négationnistes, et cultivé parfois par des universitaires confus. Oublions ces pamphlets qui

domaine de la religion.<br>

Author(s): Jaeger Henry-Evrard Hasso<br>
Abstract: IV, 3, 12. — G. Ebeltng will in den Beispielen des xenophontischen Sprachgebrauchs
„primär" eine „Lehre vom sprachlichen Ausdruck" sehen: art. „Hermeneutik" in „Die Religion
in Geschichte und Gegenwart" (3. Aufl.), Bd. 3, Tübingen 1959, S. 242-262. Von einem autarken
„sprachlichen Ausdruck" im Sinne der Heidegger- und BuLTMANNschulen, das heißt als
„sprechender Sprache", die selbst spricht, dem Denken vorangehend, kann in den klassischen
Quellen keine Rede sein. Der viel zitierte Artikel von G. Ebeling, der heute eine derartige
Lehrautorität erhalten hat, so daß auch Paul Ricoeur ihn zum Ausgangspunkt der Vor-
geschichte seiner „Herméneutiqud' nimmt, bedürfte, was den „historischen" Teil angeht, einer
längeren Entwirrung. Der Artikel hätte unter dem Titel „Die Hermeneutik und ihre Geschichte
im Sinne der Lehren von Heidegger und Bultmann" vielleicht weniger Mißverständnisse
propagiert. Wir haben noch Gelegenheit, anderen Orts die Unhaltbarkeit der Aussagen
Ebelings nachzuweisen.<br>

Abstract: Lucifer bedeutet >Morgenstern<, was typologisch auf die Johannes-Offenbarung voraus-
deutet, wo Jesus über sich selbst sagt: »Ich bin die Wurzel des Geschlechts David, der helle Mor-
genstern.« (Apk. 22,16) Damit wird die figurale Verwandtschaft zwischen Lucifer und Chri-
stus sichtbar, die Freud wiederum zum Indiz dafür nimmt, daß Verstoßung und Opferung auf
einen grundlegenden Konflikt der Lieblingssöhne mit dem göttlichen Vater zurückdeuten. Vgl.
dazu Johann Heinrich Zedier: Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon aller Wissenschaften
und Künste (Halle, Leipzig 1732-54) Bd. 18, Sp.714: Lucifer sei »der Aurora Sohn« und »heisset
auch die Venus, wenn sie vor der Sonne hergeht«. Zur Lucifer-Deutung Carsten Colpe: Alter-
tum: Religion und Mythos in: Das Böse. Eine historische Phänomenologie des Unerklärlichen,

Abstract: Vgl. Heinrich Heine: De l'Allemagne (Paris 21855) Bd.l, 7f. Die Schrift ist allerdings
dem deutschen Leser unter dem Titel Zur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutsch-
land bekannt und deswegen wird hier nach der deutschen Vorlage zitiert: »Die Franzosen
glaubten, in der letzten Zeit, zu einem Verständnis Deutschlands zu gelangen, wenn sie sich
mit den Erzeugnissen unserer schönen Literatur bekannt machten. Hierdurch haben sie sich
aber aus dem Zustande gänzlicher Ignoranz nur erst zur Oberflächlichkeit erhoben. Denn die
Erzeugnisse unserer schönen Literatur bleiben für sie nur stumme Blumen, der ganze deutsche
Gedanke bleibt für sie ein unwirtliches Rätsel, so lange sie die Bedeutung der Religion und
der Philosophie in Deutschland nicht kennen«, vgl. Heinrich Heine: Zur Geschichte der Reli-
gion und Philosophie in Deutschland (Stuttgart 1997) 7. Anschließend rechtfertigt Heine den
Verzicht auf die fachliche Begrifflichkeit: »Es gilt zunächst die Ausdrücke einer Schulsprache
zu vermeiden, die den Franzosen gänzlich unbekannt ist« (ebd.). In diesem Kontext ist es inte-
ressant festzustellen, dass Heine in seinem De l'Allemagne-Aufsatz unterschiedliche Ausdrücke
benutzt, die er später als »Weltanschauung« in seiner Übersetzung wiedergibt. Einmal heißt
es: »ce système«, ein anderes Mal: »la manière d'evisager le monde«, vgl. H. Heine: De l'Alle-
magne, ebd. 7,82.<br>

nicht verhindern können, daß die in die anthropologische Umkehrung eingelassene Spiegelmeta-

kannt und aufgegriffen wurde, so bei K. Schwarz (Das Wesen der Religion. Bd. 1. Halle 1847.

Abstract: Eine auffällige Unstimmigkeit liegt darin, daß Zymner bei der Metapher, die er als Modell
der Parabel auffaßt, durchaus zugesteht, daß sie erst aus dem situativen Kontext als solche er-
kannt werden kann (vgl. ZYMNER - s. Anm. 7 -, Zur Pragmatik der Metapher, hier S. 57-59,
auch S. 61, 72), bei der Parabel jedoch nicht (S. 72, 77, 92-96). Aber „implizite Transfersignale"
können oft nur mit Vorwissen von Rezipienten und mit Hilfe der Situation identifiziert werden. -
Noch grundsätzlicher wird, im Gefolge von Hermann Gunkel, für das Verständnis aller Gat-
tungen der „Sitz im Leben" zur Voraussetzung gemacht bei C. Kühl, G. Bornkamm: Art. For-
men und Gattungen. In: Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart. 3. Aufl. Bd. 2 (1958), Sp.
996-1005. - Für die nahe verwandte Fabel vgl. auch Klaus Grubmüller (1979): Zur Pragmatik
der Fabel. Der Situationsbezug als Gattungsmerkmal. In: Textsorten und literarische Gattungen.

Abstract: G. Chr.LlCHTENBERG: Schriften und Briefe. Bd. 2. München 1971, S. 412.
Ähnlich heißt es bei FICHTE: „Ich kann sonach wohl sagen: es wird gedacht - doch: kaum kann
ich auch dies sagen... es èrscheint der Gedanke: daß ich empfinde, anschaue, denke; keineswegs
aber: ich empfinde, schaue an, denke. Nur das erstere ist Factum; das zweite ist hinzu erdichtet."
J. G. Fichte: Sämmtl. Werke. Bd. 2, S. 244 f. Heißt das, „das allgemeine Weltdenken denkt in
mir"? wie Heinrich Heine spöttisch gegen Fichte vorbringt? Vgl. Heine: Zur Geschichte der
Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland (1833/4). Leipzig o. J., S. 154. Oder handelt es sich be-
reits um ein phänomenologisch verwertbares Argument? Genau das legte in einer psychologi-
schen Variation desselben Themas dann W. James nahe: Psychologie (1893). Leipzig 1909, S. 149.
Auf den ersten Blick läßt das „es denkt" freilich alles offen: bedeutet es, daß die Natur sich in uns
denkt, oder muß man kritisch danach fragen, wer das „es denkt" denkt? Vgl. den Hinweis auf
J. Petzoldt bei Rüdiger Welter: Der Begriff der Lebenswelt. München 1986, S. 33 f,

Abstract: Encroachments of contemporary social theory on the field of theology are the focal point of this essay. In postmodernity, theology facilitates connections with social theory. In the domain of theology, sociocultural problems are being presented as theological issues. Secularized variants of world theology meet with theologizing postsecular social theory above and beyond sociology. This is facilitated by the constant discourse of ambiguity. In this discourse, "the theological" is a vehicle of indeterminate meanings. Praxis' oriented discourse uses the term "social theory" with its modernist connotative envelope of science and rationality, but with no obligation whatsoever to maintain objectivity of cognition. Sociology doesn't interfere with theological discourse, but may analyze it, leaving the otherworldly outside its perspective on sociocultural phenomena. The sociotheological discourse of ambiguity, however, opposes both religion and the rationality of science.<br>

Abstract: This forum gathers together a set of essays composed in response to the 2011 special issue of Religion & Literature 42.1–2, titled "Something Fearful": Medievalist Scholars on the "Religious Turn" in Literary Criticism, edited by Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and Jonathan Juilfs. The forum's ten authors reflect both on essays within the original volume and on the broader questions engaged by it and through its very publication; responsive remarks from Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and two contributors to that initiating volume conclude the conversation. Through conversation, response, and critical engagement, the forum's contributors weigh questions of the language of belief in scholarly discourse, of the continuities of religious practice across history, of the assumptions and beliefs undergirding critical work on religion and literature and culture, and of the acknowledgement of the religious convictions of medievalists' scholarly subjects, scholars, and the communities of both.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i24441733<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): VIDAL CLÉMENT<br>
Abstract: Philosophy lacks criteria to evaluate its philosophical theories. To fill this gap, this essay introduces nine criteria to compare worldviews, classified in three broad categories: objective criteria (objective consistency, scientificity, scope), subjective criteria (subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality), and intersubjective criteria (intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity). The essay first defines what a worldview is and exposes the heuristic used in the quest for criteria. After describing each criterion individually, it shows what happens when each of them is violated. From the criteria, it derives assessment tests to compare and improve different worldviews. These include the is-ought, ought-act, and is-act first-order tests; the critical and dialectical second-order tests; the mixed-questions and first-second-order third-order tests; and the we-I, we-it, and it-I tests. The essay then applies these criteria and tests to a concrete example, comparing the Flying Spaghetti Monster deity with Intelligent Design. For another application, it draws more general fruitful suggestions for the dialogue between science and religion.<br>

entretiens, cette préférence est surtout déterminée par une prescription religieuse
d'ordre alimentaire. Les chrétiens orthodoxes et les musulmans utilisent des rituels
différents pour tuer les animaux d'où l'interdiction pour les uns et les autres de
manger la même viande.<br>

Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer, Wahrheit und Methode (Tübingen: Max Niemeyers Verlag, 1972), 259.
"[Die] Romantik... mißt nicht mehr die Vergangenheit mit den Maßstäben der Gegenwart wie an
einem Absoluten, sie spricht vergangene Zeiten einen eigenen Wert zu.... Die großen Leistungen
der Romantik, die Erweckung der Zeitenfrühe, das Vernehmen der Stimme der Völker in Liedern, die
Sammlung der Märchen und der Sagen, die Pflege des alten Brauchtums, die Entdeckung der Spra-
chen als Weltanschauungen, das Studium der "Religion und Weisheit der Inder"—sie alle haben his-
torische Forschung ausgelöst, die langsam, Schritt für Schritt in ahnungsreiche Wiedererweckung in
abständige historische Erkenntnis verwandelte. Der Anschluss der historischen Schule an die Roman-
tik bestätigt damit, daß die romantische Wiederholung des Ursprünglichen selber auf dem Boden
der Aufklärung steht. Die historische Wissenschaft des 19. Jahrhunderts ist ihre stolzeste Frucht und
versteht sich geradezu als die Vollendung der Aufklärung, als den letzen Schritt in der Befreiung des
Geistes von dogmatischer Befangenheit, der Schritt zur objektieven Erkenntnis der geschichtlichen
Welt, die der Erkenntnis der Natur durch die moderne Wissenschaft ebenbürtig zur Seite tritt."<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24659567<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): WARE OWEN<br>
Abstract: One of the central questions of Jacques Derrida's later writings concerns the sources of religion. At times he gives explicit priority to the universal dimension of religion. In other places, however, he considers the primacy of faith in its concrete, historical context. This paper will clarify Derrida's relationship to universality and historicity by first comparing his notion of "messianicity without messianism" to that of Walter Benjamin's "weak Messianism." After drawing out these differences, I will focus on Derrida's later writings. I will show that much of the ambiguity of Derrida's thinking on religion can be resolved by turning to his work on khōra, the Greek word for "space" or "matter." The rhetoric of khōra can allow us to think through a twofold logic, one that includes the universal/historical distinction and exceeds its alternatives.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24708906<br>

Author(s): Geertsema Hendrik<br>
Abstract: Putnam's own position represents another attempt at overcoming the dilemma of
objectivism and relativism. See, for example, Reason, pp. ixff. He criticizes both metaphysical
realism and cultural relativism. He, too, fails, however, to overcome it because in his critique
of the one standpoint he is forced to argue from the standpoint of the other, and conversely.
It is tempting to compare the debate that is presently taking place in philosophy with the
struggle that has been going on for a long time in the Christian religion. The same fate that
befell faith in Scripture, when this canon of the Christian religion was understood in the
context of history, now also befalls the trust in reason, as the ultimate authority of humanism.
In both instances one sees fundamentalism pitted against relativism.<br>

Abstract: The expression innate impulse' is derived from Dooyeweerd's definition of religion in
NC I, 57: "the innate impulse of human selfhood to direct itself toward the true or toward a
pretended absolute Origin of all temporal diversity of meaning, which it finds focused con-
centrically in itself."<br>

Abstract: I concur with Shah and Farr (2011) vs. Obama. First comes a quote from President
Obama, then their commentary: '"What our deliberative, pluralistic democracy demands is that
the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific,
values." Religious motivation is fine; just don't make your religious views the basis for public
policy. But democracy "demands" no such thing. Democracy is a system that adjudicates
contending claims.'<br>

Abstract: Les rapports entre islam et psychologie en Égypte sont ici étudiés sur le terrain, dans une association de conseil et de formation psychologique cairote dont les responsables revendiquent une expertise reposant sur un processus d'institutionnalisation de la psychologie plus que centenaire. Une seconde ressource normative invoquée au sein de l'association est la religion. En réponse à l'indétermination qui peut résulter de ces efforts de synthèse, les aspirations au statut de classe moyenne constituent le troisième élément à prendre en compte pour comprendre la façon dont ce discours psychologique évolue. Il est alors possible de s'interroger sur les influences extérieures s'exerçant sur la discipline, notamment à travers les objectifs thérapeutiques qui lui sont assignés. This article seeks to explore the links between Islam and psychology in Egypt, focusing on the example of a Cairo-based association proposing counseling and teaching. Its leaders claim an expertise based on a more-than-a-century-old process of psychological institutionalization. Religion is a second normative resource used by the association. To resolve the qualms resulting from these efforts to produce a synthesis between the two, a third element has to be taken into account: the life aspirations linked to the middle class status. Eventually, this case study provides an insight on the external influences that shape the discipline, notably in the light of the assigned therapeutic goals. Las relaciones entre islam y psicología en Egipto son aquí estudiadas en el campo, en una asociación de consejo y de formación psicológica cairota cuyos responsables reivindican una expertise que reposa en un proceso de institucionalización de la psicología más que centenario.

Abstract: The Earth’s Children series of prehistoric novels by Jean M. Auel, beginning with
         The Clan of the Cave Bear(1980) and culminating inThe Land of Painted Caves(2010), contains a compelling vision of two species of human practising two utterly different kinds of religion. On the one hand there are the Neanderthals, who practice a pure totemism, while on the other there are the anatomically modern humans, whose religion centres on the worship of an Earth Goddess. Auel’s heroine, Ayla, straddles both religious spheres, but she herself initiates a crisis within the anatomically modern human religious world. This article examines the different fictional religions in these popular and influential books, considers the sources Auel drew on in creating them and considers the influence these books may exert on public understanding of religion, including among future cohorts of students of religion.<br>

Article Title: On the Reasons for Indeterminacy of Translation<br>
Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
Issue: e24798420<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Blond Louis<br>
Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Abstract: On peut opposer point par point la conclusion d,uHazaran" a la conclusion de "La
Pierre qui pousse" d'Albert Camus. Dans cette nouvelle, d'Arrast est un ingenieur fran-
cais qui se rend a Itaqua, une petite ville du Bresil, pour construire une digue et proteger
les habitants du bidonville contre les crues du fleuve. Dans Tepilogue du recit, d'Arrast
vient s'etablir lui-meme au centre de la nouvelle communaute. On voit ici tout ce qui
separe les deux ecrivains. Tandis que Camus met Taccent sur Tintegration des minorites
dans la ville, sur la justice sociale et sur les bienfaits de la technologie moderne, Le Clezio
refuse en bloc les produits de la vie moderne et decrit une quete du sacre qui conduit
ses personnages a la fuite et a la rupture. La ou Camus presente une vision optimiste et
positive des relations Nord/Sud, Le Clezio met Taccent sur Tantagonisme foncier des deux
blocs. La oil Camus cherche un compromis entre le rejet de la religion etablie (la proces-
sion) et la hantise du sacre (la macumba), Le Clezio privilegie Tapport des philosophies
orientales. Sur ce point, voir Tentretien de Tecrivain avec Claude Cavallero (172-73).<br>

Article Title: SOCIOLOGIE DE LA TRADUCTION. L'EXEMPLE DE LA « BIBLE DES ÉCRIVAINS »<br>
Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i25759142<br>
Date: 6 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Lassave Pierre<br>
Abstract: Le mot « traduction » est à l'honneur: le philosophe Paul Ricœur l'érige en principe éthique, la « traductologie » se pose en nouvelle discipline littéraire et un courant de la sociologie des sciences le prend pour paradigme. Au-delà de ce dernier usage analogique, n'y a-t-il pas place pour une sociologie de la traduction qui ne soit pas seulement une sociographie des traducteurs amateurs ou professionnels, ni même une annexe fonctionnelle de la théorie des champs culturels et de leurs échanges inégaux? L'événement éditorial que constitue une nouvelle traduction littéraire de la Bible offre ainsi au sociologue matière à associer ses dimensions linguistiques, institutionnelles et relationnelles pour déterminer une « configuration traductive » exemplaire de la rencontre équivoque entre mondes littéraires, médiatiques et religieux en contexte de modernité avancée. The word « translation » has pride of place at the present time: the philosopher Paul Ricœur sets it up as an ethical principle, « translation studies » become a new international subject and the sociology of sciences takes it up as paradigm. Beyond this last figurative use, the question is how can we draw up a sociology of translation apart from studies of professional sets and transnational cultural exchanges? The New Bible Translation, a recent literary event in the French-speaking world, gives matter for combining linguistic, institutional and relational points of view. This translation case as a sociological configuration accounts for this ambiguous meeting point — at the crossroads between literature, religion and publishing — in advanced modernity.<br>

Abstract: Here, we should beware of the English translation, which tends to reify the two Chinese
characters 仏教.Literally, they indicate “teachings [of the] Buddha,” or "Buddhist teachings，”
with a further step being their identification with "Buddhism." Like the concept of “religion”
that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century to translate a Western concept, there is a sub-
tle shift between the idea of "Buddhist teachings” and the further use of the same term to indi-
cate "Buddhism."<br>

Abstract: I use an old observation (that religion is anthropomorphistic) to solve a problem almost as old (why do people have religious beliefs?) by arguing that religion is a special case of the more general phenomenon of anthropomorphism. This view suggests that religious belief, often thought nonempirical and cognitively anomalous, is as much based in experience as is nonreligious belief and that it consists in a plausible application of significant models to ambiguous phenomena. Anthropomorphism, often thought a cognitive aberration, appears to me both reasonable and inevitable, although by definition mistaken. On this argument, religious models of and for the world differ in content from nonreligious models but are epistemologically similar to them.<br>

Abstract: As the disciplines of psychoanalysis and religion find themselves in a heightened cross-disciplinary context, issues of methodology remain at the forefront. This article constructs an interdisciplinary method based on the image of psychoanalysis and religion as neighbors who border along an "intimate edge"—a space of simultaneously overlapping, yet distinct concern. Using what is termed a "hermeneutic of mischievousness," this method maintains an interpretive location for that which preserves, transgresses, and transcends the disciplinary boundaries. The article concludes with a brief application of the method to the relationship between the "analytic third" and Christian trinitarian theology.<br>

Abstract: Garifuna religion is derived from a confluence of Amerindian, African and European antecedents. For the Garifuna in Central America, the spatial focus of authentic religious practice has for over two centuries been that of their former homeland and site of ethnogenesis, the island of St Vincent. It is from St Vincent that the ancestors return, through spirit possession, to join with their living descendants in ritual events. During the last generation, about a third of the population migrated to the US, especially to New York City. This departure created a new diasporic horizon, as the Central American villages left behind now acquired their own aura of ancestral fidelity and religious power. Yet New-York-based Garifuna are now giving attention to the African components of their story of origin, to a degree that has not occurred in homeland villages of Honduras. This essay considers the notion of 'leaving' and 'joining' the African diaspora by examining religious components of Garifuna social formation on St Vincent, the deportation to Central America, and contemporary processes of Africanization being initiated in New York.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>

Author(s): DiCenso James<br>
Abstract: This paper engages Freud's relation to Kant, with specific reference to each theorist's articulation of the interconnections between ethics and religion. I argue that there is in fact a constructive approach to ethics and religion in Freud's thought, and that this approach can be better understood by examining it in relation to Kant's formulations on these topics. Freud's thinking about religion and ethics participates in the Enlightenment heritage, with its emphasis on autonomy and rationality, of which Kant's model of practical reason is in many ways exemplary. At the same time, Freud advances Kantian thinking in certain important respects; his work offers a more somatically, socially, and historically grounded approach to the formation of rational and ethical capacities, and hence makes it more compatible with contemporary concerns and orientations that eschew the pitfalls of ahistorical idealist orientations.<br>

Abstract: Brewer aptly remarks: "For the sixteenth century, and even
for Wordsworth, . . . partly on the basis of texts wrongly attributed to him, Chaucer was something
of a rationalist, and consequently, a religious reformer, but the general opinion in the nineteenth
century tends to see him as something of a rationalist and therefore somewhat lukewarm in religion
and not a reformer" (2:7-8).

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: This study deals with the popular notions of "popular religion", the "feast" and the "sacred". The following article retraces the logical steps involved in F.-A. Isambert's research which enabled the author to reconstitute the stages involved in the transformation of these popular notions in terms of their social functions into concepts constructed sociologically. This analytical reconstitution is combined with a critical approach which examines both the sociological constructs themselves as well as the ideas inherent in defining social strategies. The article also summarizes the debate concerning this question and presents its own criticisms.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154168<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Weidler Markus<br>
Abstract: While the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944; 1947) is often judged to be too limited a cultural critique, it is still widely accepted as pioneering cultural criticism, a mix of critical discourse analysis, hermeneutics, and semiotics. This article contests this reputation by turning to a source that Horkheimer and Adorno are at pains to occlude: Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923-29). Drawing on the tradition of eighteenth-century German Christology revived by the Young Hegelians in general and F.W.J. Schelling in particular, Cassirer evolves a critical strategy broader than that in the Dialectic, yet clearly implied by it. Most particularly, Cassirer's Schelling analysis discriminates philosophy, art, and religion as forms of knowledge and forms of epistemological critique, where Horkheimer and Adorno recast the art of the Bildungsbürger to occlude Cassirer's innovation, a new materialist semiotics that offers cultural critique in the broader terms that the Dialectic's critics would favor.<br>

Author(s): Zelizer Roger<br>
Abstract: God is once again afoot in the public sphere. Politics has become a religious obligation. For a new breed of religious nationalist the nation-state is a vehicle of the divine. This essay seeks to accomplish four things. The first is to argue for an institutional approach to religious nationalism in order both to interpret and explain it. Second, I argue that religion and nationalism partake of a common symbolic order and that religious nationalism is therefore not an oxymoron. Third, the essay seeks to explain why religion has become such a potent political force in our time. And fourth-the task that will take up the bulk of the text-it seeks a principle of intelligibility in the semiotic order of religious nationalism that can comprehend its preoccupation with both women's erotic bodies and monies out of national control.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the professionalization of religious research in the United States and related topics. Because professional societies illumine value orientations and practices among workers in a given field, the nature of the American Catholic Sociological Society, the American Society of Christian Ethics, the Religious Research Association, and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion are briefly considered. The differential appropriation of religious research in various ecclesiastical bodies, the problem of funding religious research in the American situation, and the shift in emphasis from a pragmatic problem-solving approach focused on institutional survival to a more theoretical approach to the understanding of religious phenomena are discussed. The bifurcation between persons interested in religious research trained under theological faculties and those trained under social science faculties is noted. Likely future lines of development in theory and research are projected.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i215719<br>
Date: 11 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Young Michele<br>
Abstract: This article argues that Jürgen Habermas's view of religion as anathema to rational critical discourse reflects his misunderstanding that religion comprises a monolithic and immutable body of dogma that is closed to reason. Illustrative data from Catholic history and theology and empirical data gathered from contemporary American Catholics are used to show the weaknesses in Habermas's negation of the possibility of a self-critical religious discourse. Specifically, I highlight the doctrinal differentiation within Catholicism, its longstanding theological emphasis on the coupling of faith and reason, institutional reflexivity, and the doctrinally reflexive reasoning that contemporary Catholics use in negotiating what might appear as "contradictory" identities (e.g., being gay or lesbian and Catholic). Although the data presented take issue with Habermas's disavowal of religion, the article shows that the practical relevance of doctrinal reasoning at both the institutional and the individual level vindicate Habermas's faith in the emancipatory potential of reasoned argumentation to advance participative equality.<br>

Author(s): Zaretsky Joseph Michael<br>
Abstract: This paper argues that recent methodological developments in anthropology-variously referred to as ethnoscience and/or cognitive anthropology-can be of enormous practical benefit in the close description of religious symbolization. A rough sketch of ethnoscientific methods is drawn and some of the more general assumptions about cognitive processes which inform the theoretical perspective underpinning ethnoscience are outlined. Brief attention is given to the larger possibilities of methodological re-orientation and the development of a hermeneutical sociology of religion wherein religious systems are approached through language data.<br>

Author(s): WolfAbstract: For the past twenty-five years, a sub-branch of biblical studies has engaged, sometimes rather vigorously, in the pursuit of using sociological methods to understand the Bible. These, often autodidact biblical scholars, have taken over a branch of sociology of religion. The methods they follow in their pursuit of the strange world of the Bible can teach sociology how to retrieve a more critical sociology. The questions they ask would be helpful more generally to sociology of religion.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40000341<br>
Date: 3 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Chidester David<br>
Abstract: In "Primitive Culture" (1871), E. B. Tylor supported his theory of religion, animism, by referring to reports about "savage" dreams. Citing Henry Callaway's "Religious System of the Amazulu" (1868-1870), Tylor invoked the dreams of a Zulu diviner, a "professional seer" who becomes a "house of dreams," as a classic example of animism because "phantoms are continually coming to talk to him in his sleep." In the original account, however, these spirits were not coming "to talk" to the diviner. They were coming to kill him. By situating nineteenth-century Zulu dreams and visions in a colonial contact zone of transcultural relations and asymmetrical power relations, we find a hermeneutics of dreams dealing with indeterminacy, an energetics of dreams, linking dreams to ancestral ritual, which is radically disrupted, and a new interreligious space of resources and strategies for negotiaing and navigating within a violent world.<br>

Abstract: Shaftesbury's deism, widely representative of eighteenth-century liberal theology, may be profitably viewed as a reaction against Puritanism in particular and Pauline theology in general. Seen from this perspective, it implies, without explicitly asserting, a reduction of moral standards from the infinite conception of moral law characteristic of Protestantism. Shaftesbury showed no appreciation of the need for redemption or forgiveness, and changed the emphasis in religion from devotion to God above all else to a purely anthropocentric morality which God merely supported. But, in spite of the crudity of his theology and the dubious implications of his ethics, Shaftesbury sought to combat some of the harmful psychological effects to which Paulinism might lead when received in the wrong spirit, and manifested genuine religious insight in this effort.<br>

Abstract: This paper offers a listing of references to religious ethics in recent Anglo-American philosophical literature, organized in terms of a critical analysis of the main lines of argument to be found there. The principal focus is on metaethics, although references are included to other aspects of religious ethics. The author maintains that the case for a logical and/or a linguistic relation between religion and ethics is much stronger than is generally recognized in the philosophical discussions of these issues.<br>

Abstract: As religiões podem ser consideradas como sistemas simbólicos mediante os quais os seres humanos ao longo da sua história sempre procuraram encontrar sabedoria em ordem a enfrentar o mal Um olhar pela história das religiões oferece-nos dados que podem ser compreendidos a partir de três tipos ideais de atitude básica em relação ao problema: Ascese, Gnose, Praxis. O Budismo originário, o Maniqueísmo e a religião bí-blico-cristã são exemplificações disso mesmo. Mais do que uma opção pela exclusão, os membros da nossa cultura ocidental iluminada demonstram uma preferência pela atitude práxica. É a partir dela que nos cabe recuperar os valores das outras. Isso é também o que em muitos significa a presença de uma certa nostalgia pela "espiritualidade oriental". Ou ainda, como modesta gnose, a "teodiceia" (porquê tanto mal?): tão pouco prometedora enquanto resposta (teórica), como inevitável enquanto pergunta. /// Religions can be viewed as symbolic systems with which human beings have throughout history sought the wisdom which enables them to face evil. A survey through the history of religions exhibits features which may be brought to three ideal types of basic attitudes: the ascetic, the gnostic and the 'praxical'. Original Buddhism, Manichaeism and the biblical-Christian Religion exemplify them. Men and women of our occidental, enlightened culture need not to take an exclusive option thereabout. They show a preference for the praxical trend, even though at the same time they also retrieve some of the values of the other ones. Signs of this can be seen in the interest of many for 'oriental spirituality' as well as in that sort of modest gnosis which is "theodicee "(Why so much evil?): always unpromising as a theoretical answer and unavoidable as a question. /// Las religiones pueden ser consideradas como sistemas simbólicos con los que los seres humanos hemos buscado en nuestra historia una sabiduría para afrontar el mal.

Author(s): Corona Néstor A.<br>
Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics. To begin with, Ricoeurs initial contact with the problematic of psychoanalysis in La symbolique du mal will be treated.

Author(s): Singleton Michael<br>
Abstract: Material from an indigenous manuscript, combined with fieldwork in Ubungu (Tanzania) and relating to what conventionally but questionably was styled "ancestor worship" could, less ethnocentrically and keeping closer to the empirical evidence, be more satisfactorily described as "speaking to the ancestors." Extrapolating from this case study, much of what still goes in Western circles, academic and otherwise, as "Primitive Religion," could be more credibly considered as interlocutory interaction.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40020159<br>
Date: 7 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Mathuray Mark<br>
Abstract: This paper departs from and problematizes the almost exclusive focus in criticism of Ngugi's early works on Christianity and the effects of the colonial intrusion. Following Ngugi's exhortation to resume the broken dialogue with the gods of his people, Ngugi's early novels are read in relation to precolonial East African discourses and practices of prophecy, Gikuyu religion, and Gikuyu nationalist strategies that drew on different and opposing prophetic traditions, and, in a broader sense, discourses of religion in Africa. By locating his early work within the nexus of these discourses, a far more nuanced view of Ngugi's relation to religious and nationalist discourses emerges. This paper also attempts to uncover a symbolic geometry in Ngugi's novels determined by Gikuyu religious and cultural concepts. A focus on The River Between reveals certain authorial deployments of historical inaccuracies and dislocations in the interests of a schematization of the conflicts in the novel.<br>

Abstract: After the 'death of God', it would be a mistake to continue to think of eros in terms of a longing for possession ofthat which one is lacking, especially in matters of religion. Alongside Plato's Diotima, Kierkegaard, Levinas and even Heidegger, an alternative view of eros is proposed in which eros is gradually letting go of its possessive cravings in order to open itself for the other. In this way, eros is bent in the directionof the unselfish service of the other. The question is then asked which kind of understanding of being is implied by this redirection of eros. The answer is taken from a thinking of the meaning of being in terms of self-givenness and self-outpooring in beings, for beings to be 'there'. Our being at the service of the other can therefore be seen as a following of the call of being in us to become adequate to the meaning of being itself.<br>

Article Title: Between the Lines: Exceeding Historicism in the Study of Religion<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i378715<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Zizek Tyler<br>
Abstract: "Always historicize": Frederic Jameson's imperative today exerts a powerful influence on the study of religion. It informs a wide range of methods and, perhaps more important, it shapes influential definitions of religion and religious subjectivity and agency. This article examines this influence and argues for the necessity of thinking the limits of historicism. Building on Robert Orsi's efforts to identify a space for academic exploration in-between religious testimony/narrative and social-scientific diagnosis/ explanation, I turn to recent efforts by Eric Santner and Slavoj Zizek to articulate a concept of subjectivity-tied closely to Franz Rosenzweig's concept of "revelation"-in "excess" of history and ideology. Santner and Zizek do not argue for a new, extra-historical foundation for agency and for religious claims but rather theorize and intervene in the "syntax" by which we are bound to history and society. This approach to historicism allows the scholar of religion to enrich accounts of creative religious agency at the same time that it forces them to rethink their relation to religious phenomena and religious subjects in terms of what the anthropologist Michael Jackson calls "encounter."<br>

Article Title: All Generalizations Are Bad: Postmodernism on Theories<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i378707<br>
Date: 3 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Winch Robert A.<br>
Abstract: The ramifications of postmodernism for theology have been discussed voluminously. I want to consider the ramifications of postmodernism for the social scientific study of religion, which above all means for theories of religion. Those ramifications are wholly negative: postmodernism opposes theories, and does so because it opposes generalizations. Objections to generalizations and thereby to theories in the social sciences long antedate the rise of postmodernism, but earlier objections are on modernist grounds. Postmodernism is oblivious to these criticisms and instead assumes that criticism begins with postmodernism itself. Where at least some modernist criticisms are not easily answerable, all post-modern criticisms are easily answerable, for all of them rest on confusions about theorizing.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i387664<br>
Date: 3 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Wilcox John<br>
Abstract: This essay argues for a new religious ethical approach to fatherhood centered on children and their expanding capabilities for participation in society. Under the notion of "childism"-in analogy to feminism, womanism, humanism, and the like-it takes the perspective of the experiences and concerns of childhood as such. In contrast with a soft patriarchal argument for fatherhood that dominates much religious discourse today, it argues for a larger and more hopeful vision of fatherhood as directed toward the human social good. This requires, methodologically, a richer hermeneutical circle between religion and the social sciences. Substantively, it calls for Christian and other religious ethicists to re-imagine fatherhood as an integrated public-private responsibility that aims to cultivate children's fully human social creativity as images of their Creator.<br>

Abstract: Can one speak of Israelitism in the case of Poland? By asking this question, one runs into the classic difficulty of the universalisation of concepts and to what extent they can be transposed. As a specific method of individualistic integration, French Israelitism pre-supposes a particular organisation of citizenship and society, a dissociation of political and religious categories, as well as a specific articulation of the universal and the particular. This article shows that Israelitism as an idea and a theoretical model entered Judeo-Polish society in the 19th century. Nevertheless, the sociological and political context was radically different from the institutions and public space of the Third Republic and thus limits to the importation of the model were soon reached. All the while drawing its political references from western cultures, the troubled history of Eastern Europe was not structured by the same variables nor by the same historical ruptures. The same words (nation, State, religion) do not have the same meaning; the modes of national and political constructions, particularly between religion and politics, has very little in common with what made French Israelitism possible in the 19th century. In Poland, the paradigm of the Israelite was merely an impossible dream.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: The present research investigates the relationship between anxiety and the religiosity dimensions that Wulff (Psychology of religion: classic and contemporary views, Wiley, New York, 1991; Psychology of religion. Classic and contemporary views, Wiley, New York, 1997; Psychologia religii. Klasyczna i wspotczesna, Wydawnictwo Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, Warszawa, 1999) described as Exclusion vs. Inclusion of Transcendence and Literal vs. Symbolic. The researchers used the Post-Critical Belief scale (Hutsebaut in J Empir Theol 9(2): 48-66, 1996; J Empir Theol 10(1): 39-54, 1997) to measure Wulff's religiosity dimensions and the IPAT scale (Krug et al. 1967) to measure anxiety. Results from an adult sample (N = 83) suggest that three dimensions show significant relations with anxiety. Orthodoxy correlated negatively with suspiciousness (L) and positively with guilt proneness (O) factor—in the whole sample. Among women, Historical Relativism negatively correlated with suspiciousness (L), lack of integration (Q3), general anxiety and covert anxiety. Among men, Historical Relativism positively correlated with tension (Q4) and emotional instability (C), general anxiety, covert anxiety and overt anxiety. External Critique was correlated with suspiciousness (L) by men.<br>

Abstract: This paper reviews a body of data that identifies underlying influences that have contributed to an evolving change in American Psychiatry toward a more positive and receptive stance toward religion and spirituality over the past three decades. This development, surprising in light of the remedicalization of psychiatry and its predominantly neuro-biological orientation, is attributed to five foundational ideas that have helped to leverage this change. These are significance of culture, creative power of ritual, psychic function of belief, neuro-biology of spirituality, and relevance of recovery narratives. The impact of these factors for psychiatric assessment and treatment is described, as well as the contribution of the Oskar Pfister legacy and award to the ongoing dialogue between religion and psychiatry. Adapted from the American Psychiatric Association's 2011 Oskar Pfister Lecture in Religion and Psychiatry.<br>

Abstract: The essay refers to a concern for social justice in the origins of public health, borne in part by religious commitments, and to more recent expressions of a similar concern in debates about health equity. Equity, moreover, is affected by discursive power relations (dominant/hegemonic versus local/suppressed), which are discussed in relation to current research in the African Religious Health Assets Programme on the interaction of particular 'healthworlds' (a conceptual innovation) that shape the choices and behaviour of health-seekers. Two background theoretical positions guide the argument: Amartya Sen's claim that development is linked to freedom (including religious freedom); and, building on Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's human capabilities theory, an asset-based community approach to the building or reconstruction of public health systems. On this basis, it is argued that health systems and health interventions are just to the extent that they mediate between the necessary leadership or polity from 'above' (techné) and the experience and wisdom (métis) of those who are 'below', taking into account the asymmetries of power that this equation represents. Because difference and diversity are so often expressed in what we might reasonably call 'religious' terms, I specifically emphasize the continuing persistence of religion and, hence, the importance of accounting for its pertinence in social theory generally, and in relation to discourses of health and justice in the African context specifically. Acknowledging the ambiguities of religion, I nevertheless argue that an appreciative alignment between public health systems and religious or faith-based initiatives in health promotion, prevention and care is crucial to sustainable and just health systems in Africa.<br>

Article Title: Healthworlds: Conceptualizing Landscapes of Health and Healing<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40108723<br>
Date: 4 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Cochrane James R.<br>
Abstract: People think about health and illness in multifaceted ways, evidencing a conceptual complexity that corresponds to equally complex behaviours in relation to a diversity of healing practices. Stimulated by fieldwork in Lesotho and elsewhere, and engaging principally with Jürgen Habermas, we set out to introduce, explain and develop a conceptual innovation: healthworld. We argue that this notion describes and provides a key analytical tool for the field of health in its social context; a tool that can explain the empirical complexity of health beliefs (importantly, including religion) and behaviours, thereby illuminating possibilities for improving health practice and outcomes. Framed in relation to Habermas's notion of lifeworld, the healthworld is identified as a distinctive 'region' of the lifeworld defined by a particular telos – that of comprehensive well-being, a lifeworld without dysfunction.<br>

Article Title: L'ÉVOLUTION DE MAX HORKHEIMER VERS LE PESSIMISME ?<br>
Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117551<br>
Date: 6 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): RAULET Gérard<br>
Abstract: L'interprétation des derniers écrits de Horkheimer a suscité des controverses parfois violentes ; ils semblent en effet traduire la résignation, voire le désespoir, et marquer un retour à la théologie. Leur signification peut cependant être reconsidérée si l'on conçoit l'évolution de Horkheimer à la lumière du statut de la vérité dans la Théorie critique. La résignation, le pessimisme et la théologie provoquent-ils un changement de statut de la vérité qui autoriserait à distinguer deux Théories critiques ou ne peut-on voir dans la permanence de thèmes comme celui d'une vérité utopique et non représentable, de la nostalgie, de la dette envers l'humanité et dans l'usage du pessimisme les signes d'une continuité ? Il se pourrait alors que l'économie interne de la Théorie critique ait changé, mais sans rupture, et que ces thèmes aient constitué dès le départ un ressort essentiel du caractère critique de la Théorie critique. The interpretation of the last essays of Horkheimer has raised controversies and even polemics in so far as hopelesness, resignation and the turn back to religion seem to predominate in them. In order to reconsider this problem, Horkheimer's evolution will be interpreted here in the light of the definition of truth in Critical Theory. Do resignation, pessimism and theology involve a new definition of truth — so that one could speak of a second Critical Theory, or can themes like the utopical, nonrepresentable nature of truth, the nostalgy, the debt to humanity and the use of pessimism be understood as signs of a continuity in which the economy of Critical Theory may have changed but without any rupture between its early phase and the late works of Horkheimer and Adorno ? If this is the case one has then to show how Critical Theory could preserve its critical properties in a changed political and social situation.<br>

Abstract: A religião é uma enorme projeção de significações humanas. Estas projeções convertem-se, para os seus produtores, na forma de uma realidade de ordem transcendente. De acordo com Peter L. Berger a alienaçāo religiosa é antropologicamente necessária. A partir da fenomenologia da religiāo, cosmos sacralizado em que se constitui toda e qualquer concepçāo do mundo, faz da religiāo um âmbito de estudo para elucidar os mecanismos complexos de sentido e significado da vida humana. Rudolf Otto e Mircea Eliade sāo os fenomenólogos que mais influenciaram o pensamento de Peter L. Berger. Religion is largely a projection of human meanings. These projections are converted in the form of a reality of transcendent order back to their very authors. According to Peter L. Berger religious alienation is anthropologically necessary. From the Phenomenology of Religion, the sacralized cosmos in which any conception of the world is formed makes religion a field study to elucidate the complex mechanisms of sense and meaning of the human life. Rudolf Otto and Mircea Eliade are the phenomenologists that most influenced the thought of Peter L. Berger.<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i40156045<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Mickey Sam<br>
Abstract: This essay is an articulation of various contributions to anthropocosmic environmental ethics—an approach to environmental ethics emerging within the study of religion and ecology. In an anthropocosmic approach to environmental ethics, humans are intimately intertwined with the environment. Rather than placing value on a particular center (e.g., anthropocentric, biocentric, ecocentric) and thus excluding and marginalizing something of peripheral value, an anthropocosmic approach to ethics seeks to facilitate the mutual implication of humanity and the natural world, thereby affirming the interconnectedness and mutual constitution of central and peripheral value. Although the adjective "anthropocosmic" may seem obscure or vague, an examination of the genealogy of the term, beginning with its appearance in the works of Mircea Eliade, discloses numerous resources that have important contributions to make to the development of viable environmental ethics.<br>

Abstract: Sacred music has always been a source of controversy throughout history since it is an integral part of the liturgy. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has reached a pinnacle of controversy as its realm of consumption expands globally and inter-denominationally. This study was inspired by the idea of Ricoeur's phenomenology of religion to examine the contemporary practice of liturgy and sacred music. This brings into discussion the historical controversy and cultural milieu of adopting popular culture into youth ministry. Korean case is important because Korea represents one of the strongest Christian populations in the world and at the same time challenges - a drop in the number of young members and a huge generational gap in its church congregations. In order to scrutinize the concrete process of youth culture in the Christian community, an empirical study of youth ministry in seven mega churches in Seoul in South Korean was conducted as a case study. Sakralna glazba oduvijek je tijekom povijesti bila izvor kontroverzi jer predstavlja integrálni dio liturgije, a povijest glazbe je iz nje izrasla. Suvremena kršèanska glazba dostigla je vrhunac kontroverzije kad se njezino potrošaèko podruèje proširilo globalno i medukonfesionalno. Ovaj je članak nastao na temelju Ricoeurove fenomenologije religije i nastoji ispitati suvremenu praksu u liturgiji i sakralnoj glazbi u svjetlu nasljeda povijesne kontroverze i kultúrne sredine u prihvaćanju populárne kultúre u mladenačkoj službi božjoj. Teologija glazbe, o kojoj su raspravljali u 16. stoljeèu Luther, Zwingli i Calvin, osobito je korisna za konzultiranje pri suvremenom prilagodavanju na populárnu kulturu u crkvi. Štoviše, humanizam usaden u liturgijsku reformaciju u razdoblju renesanse otvára filozofijsko pitanje čovjekova identiteta pred licem božanskoga, o èemu se raspravljalo tijekom moderne i postmoderne povijesti sve do danas. Kako bi se pažljivo ispitao konkrétni proces mladenačke kulture u kršćanskoj zajednici, pr~<br>

Abstract: In this paper I set out a phenomenology of social transformation, based on an analysis of the distinctively religious form of communication which underlies the trans-generational and trans-cultural transmission of world traditions, taking Confucianism and Christianity as their representatives. A phenomenological analysis of their communicative structure allows the possibility of a better understanding of what can be learnt from them in the context of contemporary debates in both China and the West on the relations between religion, ethics and politics. This analysis suggests that the ethical consistency of belief and act, which is the necessary condition for the engendering of long-term solidarity in religious community, has significant implications for ethics in politics, and especially for the legitimacy of representational leadership as a focal point for change in society. The paper concludes that the historical experience of world religions can offer new insights into the nature of political leadership and representation in today's globalised world and that the appropriate locus for this inquiry is the present negotiation and re-negotiation of relations between China and the West.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Jennings Theodore W.<br>
Abstract: Ritual studies is a new discipline within the field of the study of religion. Liturgical theology is, in the West, a recent development within the Held of systematic theology. The article describes each and indicates ways in which they may contribute to the work of the other while retaining their separate identities. The development of methods for describing and analyzing ritual action may enable liturgical theology to construct its own analyses upon a more broadly phenomenological base. At the same time theology's insight into the history of liturgical action may enable ritual studies to overcome an excessively synchronie perspective and to attend to the normative character of ritual gesture.<br>

Publisher: Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh<br>
Issue: i40182556<br>
Date: 1 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: This paper begins by summarizing a handful of well-known and recent sacrificial theories commonly applied to Greek religion. It then discusses their applicability to sacrificial scenes in Homer's Iliad and in so doing examines the focalizations, marking vocabulary and verse sequences for the Iliad's two different sacrificial traditions, the commensal sacrifice and oath-sacrifice. The essay concludes that the longer narrative context for the sacrificial scenes in the Iliad has conspicuous bearing on how the scenes are shaded and on why, for instance, commensal sacrifices ignore the victim's death while oath-sacrifices emphasize it. That narrative context eludes the theories of Rene Girard, Walter Burkert, and Jean-Pierre Vernant and Marcel Detienne. However, oath-sacrificing narratives do lend themselves well to strands of ritual theory which stress metaphorical transformation and cosmic dramatization, as articulated by James Fernandez, Clifford Geertz, Stanley Tambiah, and Howard Eilberg-Schwartz.<br>

Publisher: LIBRAIRIE PHILOSOPHIQUE J. VRIN<br>
Issue: i40185100<br>
Date: 3 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ganoczy Alexandre<br>
Abstract: Cet article passe en revue les ouvrages suivants du neurobiologiste Jean-Pierre Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (un dialogue avec Paul Ricœur), 1998, L'homme de vérité, 2002. L'auteur y montre les changements dans les thèses de Changeux en les accompagnant de ses commentaires philosophiques et théologiques aussi bien critiques que constructifs. L'homme, ses origines et sa structure, le cerveau humain, la conscience de soi, la matière et sa complexité évolutive, la sensibilité artistique, la morale, la religion, la question d'une lecture intégrale de Darwin et de Spinoza, la signification du discours sur « l'homme de vérité » sont les principaux sujets traités. Le but de l'article est un dialogue interdisciplinaire entre neurosciences et théologie sur la compréhension de l'être humain. This article passes in revue the following works of the neurobiologist J.-P. Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (a dialogue with Paul Ricœur), 1998, and L'homme de vérité, 2002. The author shows the changes in Changeux's theses, accompanying them with his philosophical and theological commentaries, critical as well as constructive. Man, his origins and structure, the human brain, self consciousness, matter and its progressive complexity, artistic sensibility, morality, religion, the question of an integral reading of Darwin and Spinoza, and the significance of discourse upon « L'homme de vérité » are the principal subjects treated. The goal of the article is an interdisciplinary dialogue between the neurosciences and theology about the understanding of the human being.<br>

Author(s): Dalmais Kieran<br>
Abstract: This paper is a preliminary exploration of a neglected area in sociology of religion. It aims to interpret and to characterize the distinctive performative basis of Christian liturgy. Ambiguities in liturgical enactment can be routinely handled as long as they relate to the nuministic content of the rite and not to its social form. Silence is a distinctive non-reducible phenomenon of rite that can be related to the regulation of ceremonial form through tactful management of the implicit. Liturgies work on the basis of an apophatic characteristic that makes them distinctive as religious rituals.<br>

Abstract: Geography of religion is an important subfield of cultural geography yet its theoretical foundations remain undebated. Geographers should become more aware of other approaches to the study of religion. Whereas phenomenological awareness of the deepness of the religious quest in the human psyche is important, geographers are primarily concerned with religion's societal expression and hence will gain valuable insights through the adoption of an historical materialist approach to the study of religious institutions in class society.<br>

Abstract: This is partly an allusion to Wittgenstein on language games but I am emphasising the sense of play to add to what he says of games, life and travel. On language games, see more in
         Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/ (accessed 18 February 2010): Some properties of language-games can be noticed in Wittgenstein’s several examples and comments. They are, first, a part of a broader context termed by Wittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of language-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This does not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and every language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this sort of human activity. Finally, Wittgenstein’s choice of ‘game’ is based on the over-all analogy between language and game, assuming that we have a clearer perception of what games are. Still, just as we cannot give a final, essential definition of ‘game’, so we cannot find ‘what is common to all these activities and what makes them into language or parts of language.’<br>

Author(s): Ama Michihiro<br>
Abstract: Kurata Hyakuzō’s
         The Priest and His Disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, 1916) contributed to the unprecedented rise of religious literature during the Taishō period. The development of the Japanese religious world and the growing interests in religion by Japanese intellectuals during this period encouraged Kurata to humanize Shinran and paved the way forThe Priest and His Disciplesto become a bestseller. AlthoughThe Priest and His Disciplesis much studied, the role of fiction played in the work based on the life of a medieval Buddhist priest remains unexplored. This study first provides a background toThe Priest and His Disciplesand explains why it aroused such interest at the time. It then treats the image of Shinran at the intersection of history and fiction by referring to the study of Michel de Certeau and investigates how Kurata constructed an image of Shinran as the “other” inThe Priest and His Disciplesand placed it in history and in legends about Shinran.<br>

Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: At this juncture I should like to revisit the 1971 article that first involved me in the religious meaning of diasporic religions.
         
               In this article I gave prominence to the meaning of Africa in African American religions. It should be noted that I did not equate religion with theology. As a matter of fact, one of my major aims was to make this distinction. I felt that the discourse of black theology might actually prevent serious consideration of the wider range of meaning in religion as a form of life, thought, and action. It was not my intention in this article to give a full-blown description of any African American religion. I wanted to provide the basis for these religions as the temporal/spatial template for an alternate discourse and epistemology in the modern world. From this point of view, my position seems close to that of V. Y. Mudimbe's characterization of gnosis.31<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Abstract: Insofar as Western philosophy, like Christianity, begins with a scene of capital punishment—that of Socrates being sentenced and put to death—doesn't it also begin with the death penalty? Derrida (
      2004, 146) asks this question and answers that philosophers from Kant to Levinas justify the death penalty and “just” wars on the basis of lex talionis, which takes us back not only to its theological roots but also to the basis of sovereignty. For the sake of protection by the state, the citizen subjects him- or herself to state sovereignty and grants it, and only it, the power to kill. In other words, all justified killing, killing that is not a crime, must be circumscribed by law as in war or state-sanctioned execution. This is why for Kant (1996, 132) it is better that the sovereign head of state be assassinated rather than be executed by law, since execution of the sovereign who makes and enforces the law would undermine the power of law itself. Derrida claims that no philosopher qua philosopher has opposed the death penalty on principle, that from Plato through Heidegger, “each in his own way, and sometimes not without much hand-wringing (Rousseau), took a stand for the death penalty” (2004, 146). He concludes that the death penalty is thekeystoneof speculative philosophy, that the death penalty and sovereignty are built on the same scaffolding, and that the death penalty is the “weld” or “cement”—we might saythe bind, even the double bind—“that holds together Western traditions of religion, philosophy, and politics” (2004, 88).<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: I noted the sense of mission the founders and early leaders felt. They saw in the organization a means to make phenomenological and existential philosophy forces in North American thought, and they foresaw inclusion of a variety of philosophical approaches and topics to occasion among philosophers dialogue that was focused by phenomenology and existentialism while at the same time bringing together and in certain ways unifying the philosophers who where already engaged in what we now think of as Continental thought. In spite of the controversies and factions that developed along the way, the dominance of transcendentally oriented phenomenology became less and less pronounced during SPEP's first fifteen years. Interest in Sartre, Camus, and Heidegger grew. Emphasis intensified on language, interpretation, and historical developments and on such other disciplines as sociology, psychology, psychoanalysis, cognitive science, natural science, and religion. The Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences began holding sessions concurrently with some segments of the SPEP conferences. That group brought into SPEP's space a markedly different set of questions, issues, and approaches when compared with those that defined SPEP's orientation in the 1960s. These diversifying factors, combined with SPEP's ties with Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, fostered a growing interest in recent work that often departed from the kind of transcendental orientation found in classical phenomenology.<br>

Abstract: To rush to my conclusion: while the charge of “correlation” made by the enfants terribles has led to wildly unreasonable criticisms of late Continental philosophy, it is far from unreasonable to complain that postmodern French philosophy, and SPEP along with it, has marginalized the natural sciences. We have shown some interest (via Heidegger) in “technology,” but we have avoided the confrontation with mathematics and the natural sciences that was a part of the early phenomenological movement. Up to now philosophers such as Michel Serres and Bruno Latour have been treated as minor voices, and that, I think, has to change. The future of Continental philosophy depends on it, not just the future of a Continental philosophy of religion.<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, Kant's corpus is essentially a philosophy of limits.
         
               In the Kantian universe, apart from limitations on action, there are also dimensions of reality beyond the epistemological reach of the species. Specifically, human knowing is limited to objects conditioned by time and space. We mortals, for example, cannot know a hypothesized God, his purposes and methods—or any other postulated transcendental entity—because the efficacy of speculative reason ends where the border of the unconditioned begins. Stated technically, humans can know phenomena, things that are perceived or interpreted, but not things as they are in themselves independent of the mind (noumena). This means that any notion of totalization, of obtaining absolute knowledge, in the manner articulated by, say, Hegel, is chimerical. For Kant, then, neither the theoretical nor the empirical sphere furnishes adequate grounds to support the contention that a reconciliation of freedom and nature is possible. Now, if nothing in our knowledge or experience indicates that freedom can be rehabilitated, a potentially devastating dilemma arises for Kant: how can he save his ethics, which presupposes that ought implies can, if the will is inexorably impotent in the face of omnipresent evil? How can we do what we must if we are denied autonomy? If we cannot emancipate the will, a major plank in Kant's philosophical edifice will collapse under the weight of an unresolvable aporia. Kant, of course, is well aware of the impasse and in his29
            Critique of Judgmentposits the transformative power of art as the means of mediating between actuality and freedom. Unfortunately, Kant never fully develops the idea of how symbolic expression, a product of the creative imagination, can genuinely resuscitate the vulnerable will, so the question he himself believes religion poses—what may I hope?—remains incompletely answered. However, this lacuna is all the inspiration Ricoeur needs to bui~<br>

Abstract: As he expresses in his reading of
         Don Quixote, the idea of faith is central to Bloch's conception of utopia in the West. He sees a positive aspect in religion, which is faith having a goal when reality falls short of material fulfillment. Bloch sees the biblical Judeo-Christian tradition as the historical source of utopian ideation in the West, at least in its mystical, rather than dogmatic, emphasis on transformation (a view he shares with theologian Paul Tillich). For this reason, he can be sympathetic to religion—another way in which he resembles a traditional liberal humanist more than a typical Marxist would.<br>

Abstract: The great builder of worlds denounces his own project—and therefore every totalizing, world-building literary or political enterprise, be it historical (epic) or fantastical (Utopian): “you have reared your disunited kingdom on the vacuum of your own most intensely doubtful soul.”
         
               
            134
            Ulyssesdoes not transcend the dystopian paralysis ofDubliners;
               but in the euphoria of Bloomsday it may take135
            Finnegans Waketo remind us of that.Ulyssesis a mock epic in the same way thatA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manis mock-epiphanic: the young Stephen Dedalus's eager epiphanies—of family, sexuality, religion, romance, and philosophy—ultimately (when confronted with material circumstances) do not quite attain the transcendental climaxes he might have expected of them.Ulysses's Utopian cornucopia might thereby be seen as eventually as anticlimactic asDubliners's exotic dreams—the “Eastern enchantment” of “Araby.”
               But that would be to impose a closure upon136
            Ulysses—or, for that matter, uponFinnegans Wake—that the text stridently resists. It is not that these texts fail to attain their visions; it is just that they have not done so yet. Their endings (if they can be said to have endings) are therefore not so much anticlimactic as affirmingly preclimactic. As such, they seem to represent a mode of that “foreplay” that Jacques Derrida sees as the province of literary pleasures. But while Derrida views such textual pleasure as “null and endless,”
               Joyce's later work might be characterized as endless (which is not to say directionless) and full: an inexhaustible crescendo of Barthesian137
