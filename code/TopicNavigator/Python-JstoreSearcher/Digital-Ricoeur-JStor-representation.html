  Abstract: Traumatic violence has caught Oedipus in an ongoing repetition of mimetic rivalry, rooting him in an eternal present. Compellingly demonstrated not only in
                  Oedipus the Kingbut also inOedipus at Colonus, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

  Abstract: In his classic book

He cogently argued that the media were a ʺpseudo-environmentʺ—a human creation that people insert between themselves and their external world. This media environment, said Lippmann, is made up of ʺfictions.ʺ ʺBy fictions I do not mean lies,ʺ he wrote. ʺI mean a representation of the environment which is in lesser or greater degree made by man himself.

  Abstract: WERE THEY EVER TO MEET, it is doubtful that Gaylord Kambarami would think much of Godfrey Nzira’s Christianity. Kambarami’s understanding of Christianity emerges out of a tradition in which “the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible” is a clarion call. Kambarami wants to put a Bible in the hands of every Zimbabwean. The image that his goal brings to mind is animated by the palpable sense that Christianity can be quantified; the more Bibles there are, the more Christianity there is. For Kambarami, the Bible is not a representation but a presence. When Zimbabweans are joined together<br>

  Book Title: Being There-The Fieldwork Encounter and the Making of Truth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Hammoudi Abdellah<br>
  Abstract: Challenges to ethnographic authority and to the ethics of representation have led many contemporary anthropologists to abandon fieldwork in favor of strategies of theoretical puppeteering, textual analysis, and surrogate ethnography. In
      Being There,John Borneman and Abdellah Hammoudi argue that ethnographies based on these strategies elide important insights. To demonstrate the power and knowledge attained through the fieldwork experience, they have gathered essays by anthropologists working in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tanzania, the Canadian Arctic, India, Germany, and Russia that shift attention back to the subtle dynamics of the ethnographic encounter. From an Inuit village to the foothills of Kilimanjaro, each account illustrates how, despite its challenges, fieldwork yields important insights outside the reach of textual analysis.<br>

  Author(s) Borneman John<br>
  Abstract: This essay examines the relation of presence in fieldwork to interlocution. Within anthropology in the past several decades, two kinds of criticisms of the fieldwork encounter have had particular resonance: that fieldwork experience and presence do not generate any unique knowledge and that the power/dominance of the (Western) ethnographer ethically taints the knowledge derived from encounters. The questioning of the ethnographer’s presence has frequently led to text-based reading being substituted for fieldwork experience, with a corresponding focus on textual representation; the questioning of the ethnographer’s power has led to demands for collaboration and dialogue, which in turn often emphasize righteous<br>

  Abstract: The decade that followed the events of July 1952 critically altered the conventional assumptions of post–World War I Egyptian historiography. This impact was obvious. A variety of state-owned media invoked the memory of past events on a daily basis. Indeed, over the years, scholars had been drawn to the extensive usage of the past during the 1950s. Subscribing to the idea that the task of historiography is mainly that of studying shifts in historical representation, they emphasized the changing image of several rulers and popular leaders.¹ Though the issue of changing historical images was the most visible historiographical trait<br>

  Book Title: Cannibal Talk-The Man-Eating Myth and Human Sacrifice in the South Seas<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: In this radical reexamination of the notion of cannibalism, Gananath Obeyesekere offers a fascinating and convincing argument that cannibalism is mostly "cannibal talk," a discourse on the Other engaged in by both indigenous peoples and colonial intruders that results in sometimes funny and sometimes deadly cultural misunderstandings. Turning his keen intelligence to Polynesian societies in the early periods of European contact and colonization, Obeyesekere deconstructs Western eyewitness accounts, carefully examining their origins and treating them as a species of fiction writing and seamen's yarns. Cannibalism is less a social or cultural fact than a mythic representation of European writing that reflects much more the realities of European societies and their fascination with the practice of cannibalism, he argues. And while very limited forms of cannibalism might have occurred in Polynesian societies, they were largely in connection with human sacrifice and carried out by a select community in well-defined sacramental rituals.
      Cannibal Talkconsiders how the colonial intrusion produced a complex self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the fantasy of cannibalism became a reality as natives on occasion began to eat both Europeans and their own enemies in acts of "conspicuous anthropophagy."<br>

It analyzes the psychological representation and functioning of religious content in the individual. This perspective is useful for revealing and describing aspects of religion that may not be captured otherwise, but obviously it is only one of a universe of perspectives that may be taken with respect to religion, each contributing in a different way to the investigation of the field—but, concurrently, each perspective submitted to specific restrictions.<br>

  Abstract: The last two decades of the twentieth century witnessed a popular representation of Sikhs in the Indian media as bloodthirsty avengers rather than as bloodied victims. The principal reason for this stereotype was the rise of Sikh nationalism in the early 1980s. Akali Dal (army of the immortal), the main political party of the Sikhs in the Punjab, was demanding increased autonomy for all the states of India. During that period, relations with the Indian government became increasingly strained as a result.

  Abstract: Michel Beaujour states his dissatisfaction with the term 'autoportrait' to encapsulate adequately literary endeavours at self-representation.¹ The connection between self-portraiture and painting is evident, and the slippage of the term across mediums leads, in Beaujour's opinion, to deny the specificity of literary works. Yet, referring to works such as Michel de Montaigne's
                  Essais, Michel Leiris'sL'âge d'hommeand Jean-Jacques Rousseau'sRêveries, Beaujour highlights its usefulness as a tool that distinguishes it from autobiographical texts for two fundamental reasons. First, self-portraiture insists upon an absence of continuity, thus defying any clearly arranged order of events that contribute to a personality created<br>

  Abstract: As communities continue to shape and reshape their collective memories, new events and information are constantly combined and integrated with previous knowledge to form flexible mental schemas. Representation of trauma and construction of collective identity are facilitated by these flexible, preexisting schemas. Memories of events run back and forth in time, from past to present and vice-versa, as more recent events and figures are associated with earlier ones (Schwartz 1991, 222, 233–34; van der Kolk and van der Hart 1995, 171; Yerushalmi 1996). The shattering and disruptive experiences of trauma are processed and represented through already-existing mnemonic and narrative<br>

  Abstract: Fiction and history in the era after World War II are interlocking journeys by immigrants to America’s shores. This immigrant tide in contemporary American fiction is global, flowing across diasporas, borders, and postcolonial terrains. From the Holocaust to the Haitian and Cuban boatlifts, many of the departures and arrivals are reflections of recent historical traumas, creating in fiction what Bharati Mukherjee terms “odysseys of dislocation” (Woodford 2). Immigration for America’s short story writers and novelists today is the representation of radically new desires by the world’s uprooted peoples, an allegory chronicling the evolution of a multicultural nation-state.<br>

The format will follow that of the previous chapter: a general summary, followed by a description of intersubjectivity and alterity, and a final focus on love and justice. Again, while intending to provide a fair representation of Marcel’s work, the role played by these first two exegetical chapters—that of anticipating an engagement between Levinas and Marcel on the question of otherness—requires a more selective summary.<br>

  Abstract: What would a Levinasian autobiography look like? Is such a thing imaginable? The question is directed in the first instance at autobiography, as a question concerning its ability to go beyond the representation of the subject to write the encounter with the absolutely other for which Levinas’s ethical philosophy calls. But it is also, in the second instance, a question for Levinas, concerning the potential of autobiography to represent an alterity perhaps not fully accounted for by his philosophy. This double question presides over the reflection that follows.<br>

  Abstract: Bodies have always been the subjects of representation, sometimes written about in texts but more often carved in stone or painted on walls. Such images constitute a central feature of the visual culture from which most people in most historical periods have derived their knowledge of how the body is ordered in their society. As postmodern theories constantly remind us, the order of the body is also the political, social, economic, religious, and sexual order of a society.

  Book Title: Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clift Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Whereas historical determinacy conceives the past as a complex and unstable network of causalities, this book asks how history can be related to a more radical future. To pose that question, it does not reject determinacy outright but rather seeks to explore how it works. In examining what it means to be "determined" by history, it also asks what kind of openings there might be in our encounters with history for interruptions, re-readings, and re-writings. Engaging texts spanning multiple genres and several centuries from John Locke to Maurice Blanchot, from Hegel to Benjamin Clift looks at experiences of time that exceed the historical narration of experiences said to have occurred in time. She focuses on the co-existence of multiple temporalities and opens up the quintessentially modern notion of historical succession to other possibilities. The alternatives she draws out include the mediations of language and narration, temporal leaps, oscillations and blockages, and the role played by contingency in representation. She argues that such alternatives compel us to reassess the ways we understand history and identity in a traumatic, or indeed in a post-traumatic, age.<br>

  Book Title: The Tears of Sovereignty: Perspectives of Power in Renaissance Drama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LORENZ PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: A comparative study of the representation of sovereignty in paradigmatic plays of early modernity, The Tears of Sovereignty argues that the great playwrights of the period--William Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, and Calderon de la Barca--reconstitute the metaphors through which contemporary theorists continue to conceive the problems of sovereignty. The book focuses in particular on the ways the logics of these metaphors inform sovereignty's conceptualization as a "body of power." Each chapter is organized around a key tropological operation performed on that "body," from the analogical relations invoked in Richard II, through the metaphorical transfers staged in Measure for Measure to the autoimmune resistances they produce in Lope's Fuenteovejuna, and, finally, the allegorical returns of Calderon's Life is a Dream and Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. The "tears" of sovereignty are the exegetical tropes produced and performed on the English stages and Spanish corrales of the seventeenth century through which we continue to view sovereignty today.<br>

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This w~<br>

  Abstract: Like the practice of stone tool-making that long preceded it, paleolithic cave drawing originated in a particular kind of tactile–kinesthetic activity, and one similarly giving rise to the creation of spatial forms. With cave drawing, however, the spatial forms entailed concepts tied to pictorial rather than sculptural space. In traditional discussions of cave art where functional or semantic interpretations dominate, little if any attention is given to these concepts. Instead, theories are advanced—and disputed—concerning the representation of animals and the practice of hunting-magic; figural representations in general are analyzed in the context of fertility rites, sexual symbolism,<br>

  Book Title: "Insubordinate Irish"-Travellers in the Text<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): hAodha Mícheál Ó<br>
  Abstract: This book traces a number of common themes relating to the representation of Irish Travellers in Irish popular tradition and how these themes have impacted on Ireland’s collective imagination. A particular focus of the book is on the exploration of the Traveller as “Other", an "Other" who is perceived as both inside and outside Ireland’s collective ideation. Frequently constructed as a group whose cultural tenets are in a dichotomous opposition to that of the “settled" community, this book demonstrates the ambivalence and complexity of the Irish Traveller “Other" in the context of a European postcolonial country. Not only has the construction and representation of Travellers always been less stable and “fixed" than previously supposed, these images have been acted upon and changed by both the Traveller and non-Traveller communities as the situation has demanded. Drawing primarily on little-explored Irish language sources, this volume demonstrates the fluidity of what is often assumed as reified or “fixed". As evidenced in Irish-language cultural sources the image of the Traveller is inextricably linked with the very concept of Irish identity itself. They are simultaneously the same and “Other" and frequently function as exemplars of the hegemony of native Irish culture as set against colonial traditions. This book is an important addition to the Irish Studies canon, in particular as relating to those exciting and unexplored terrains hitherto deemed “marginal" - Traveller Studies, Romani Studies and Diaspora/Migration Studies to name but a few.<br>

  Abstract: This volume has traced the development of the Traveller image as ‘Other’ through mythical and binary discourses of alterity. Until the recent arrival of a more overtly multicultural society in Ireland Travellers have constituted the ‘Other’ for mainstream Irish society. As ‘Other’ they have often acted as objects on whom power is exercised. Their representation and the roles constructed for them have been determined primarily by the settled community and have been influenced by the need to define national, social and class identity. This project of representation has used the tools of mythology and history. These two related aspects of<br>

  Book Title: Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunworth Felicity<br>
  Abstract: "Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage" is a study of the dramatised mother figure in English drama from the mid-sixteenth to the early seventeenth centuries. It explores a range of genres: moralities, histories, romantic comedies, city comedies, domestic tragedies, high tragedies, romances and melodrama and includes close readings of plays by such diverse dramatists as Udall, Bale, Phillip, Legge, Kyd, Marlowe, Peele, Shakespeare, Middleton, Dekker and Webster. The study is enriched by reference to religious, political and literary discourses of the period, from Reformation and counter-Reformation polemic to midwifery manuals and Mother’s Legacies, the political rhetoric of Mary I, Elizabeth I and James VI, reported gallows confessions of mother convicts and Puritan conduct books. It thus offers scholars of literature, drama, art and history a unique opportunity to consider the literary, visual and rhetorical representation of motherhood in the context of a discussion of familiar and less familiar dramatic texts.<br>

  Abstract: The critic Jean Howard has warned against the assumption ‘ that theatrical representations have an ideological significance which is fixed and unchanging or which is unaffected by the conditions in which the representations are produced and consumed’.² This book has argued for the importance of motherhood in the drama of early modern England and has attested to the mother’s value both as a signifier of unchanging values and as a figure whose representation readily responds to the demands of ideological and political change. The approach has been thematic: to discover how far genre and convention influence representation; and teleological: to<br>

  Abstract: There exists no communication without a representation of the Other, because the Other is never a “reality,” but a virtuality. Admittedly, this virtuality was able to acquire the (illusory) image of a “reality” in the colonial space, because the colonized Other had a status, actually a nonstatus, that was relatively coherent within the dominant colonial stereotype. This means that some people were able to believe in a “real” connection between the image and the figure, making in some way a “being” out of this virtuality, that of the native. In our own postcolonial times, this vision admittedly persists, but not<br>

  Book Title: The Rigor of a Certain Inhumanity-Toward a Wider Suffrage<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): LLEWELYN JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the idea of universal suffrage, John Llewelyn accepts the challenge of Derrida's later thought to renew his focus on the ethical, political, and religious dimensions of what makes us uniquely human. Llewelyn builds this concern on issues of representation, language, meaning, and logic with reflections on the phenomenological figures who informed Derrida's concept of deconstruction. By entering into dialogue with these philosophical traditions, Llewelyn demonstrates the range and depth of his own original thinking. The Rigor of a Certain Inhumanity is a rich and passionate, playful and perceptive work of philosophical analysis.<br>

  Abstract: Right from his entrance on the philosophical scene in the late 1960s, Stanley Cavell has insisted that philosophy is confronted with the same cultural problems, burdens, and commitments—collectively known as modernism—that confront art. From some moment during the nineteenth century, artistic conventions for representation and composition no longer seemed to be adequate bearers of contemporary expression; along with the corrosion of the given framework of conventions, the stable relation between artist and audience also became more fragile, at times broken. As Cavell sees it, this situation is mirrored in philosophy: after Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein, there is no<br>

The authors of this chapter have over twenty-five years of experience working with people’s history and community memories.

  Abstract: Most academics read
                  The Satanic Verses(1988) as an extended meditation on cultural hybridity. As Gayatri Spivak argues, its mode of representation is “citation, reinscription, re-routing the historical,“epitomizing postcoloniality because it systematically dislodges “every metropolitan definition” (104). The novel is predicated on this trope of postcolonial disruption, foregrounding the political and cultural fallout of imperial contraction and the immigration of former colonial subjects to the metropole. InThe Location of Culture,Homi Bhabha famously reads Rushdie’s novel as a testament to “culture’s [inherent]hybridity” and the “indeterminacy of diasporic identity” (38, 225).

  Abstract: Focusing on the literary representation of performance practices in anglophone, francophone, and hispanophone Caribbean literature, Jeannine Murray-Román shows how a shared regional aesthetic emerges from the descriptions of music, dance, and oral storytelling events. Because the historical circumstances that led to the development of performance traditions supersede the geopolitical and linguistic divisions of colonialism, the literary uses of these traditions resonate across the linguistic boundaries of the region. The author thus identifies the aesthetic that emerges from the act of writing about live arts and moving bodies as a practice that is grounded in the historically, geographically, and culturally specific features of the Caribbean itself.<br>

Some read it as a celebration of human love; others as an erudite philosophical work; still others as a satirical representation of social and sexual follies. On one hand it was praised as an edifying treatise, on the other condemned as lascivious and misogynistic.<br>

  Book Title: Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections. Most contributions refer to specifically historical phenomena and meaning-constructions. Some touch on the subjects of biographical memory and biographical constructions of reality. Of all the various affinities between the contributions collected here, the most important is their consistent attention to issues of the constitution and representation of temporal experience.<br>

At the centre of such memory is the manner in which the city space is captured in the shorthand of symbol or mental representation. For example, the city of Paris is most easily represented by certain of the monuments that define its central space, or possibly by less monumental buildings that nonetheless capture the flavour and atmosphere of a particular quarter or

  Abstract: Within the field of cultural studies discussions on the relationship between researcher and the subject(s) of research in recent years have mainly been held under the heading of ‘representation.’ The term, as it has generally been applied, is founded on an epistemological assumption: the notion of knowledge as the mirror of reality. This notion itself is based on a concept of objectivity which introduces a categorical separation between reality and its description or analysis, and thus gets into the problem of the adequacy of representation and its correspondence to the object depicted.

  Abstract: The Grecanici of Southern Italyprovides a comprehensive ethnography that examines the ways the minority developed and sustain enduring cultural forms of solidarity and relatedness. Stavroula Pipyrou proposes the concept of "fearless governance" to describe overlapping and sometimes contradictory systems of power, authority, and relational networks that enable the Grecanici to achieve political representation at the intersection of local, national, and global encounters. Refuting easy assumptions of top-down governmental influence, Pipyrou shows how the Grecanici find political representation through the European Union and UNESCO, state policy, civic associations, family networks and illegal organizations; not being afraid to take risks, incur wrath, lose friends, or risk death in challenging the political status-quo.<br>

  Abstract: Saul Friedlander has identified the anxieties that have come to characterize debates about the historical construction of events known as the Shoah, the killing of European Jews by the Nazis and their national collaborators in occupied Europe. He writes: “On the one hand, our traditional categories of conceptualization and representation may well be insufficient, our language itself problematic. On the other hand, in the face of these events we feel the need of some stable narration; a boundless field of possible discourse raises the issue of limits with particular stringency.”¹ These concerns about processes, rhetoric, and memory have an impact<br>

  Abstract: In this book, Jaime Rodr+¡guez Matos proposes the GÇ£formlessGÇ¥ as a point of departure in thinking through the relationship between politics and time. Thinking through both literary and political writings around the Cuban Revolution, Rodr+¡guez Matos explores the link between abstract symbolic procedures and various political experiments that have sought to give form to a principle of sovereignty based on the category of representation. In doing so, he proposes the formless as the limit of modern and contemporary reflections on the meaning of politics while exploring the philosophical consequences of a formless concept of temporality for the critique of metaphysics._x000D_ Rodr+¡guez Matos takes the writing and thought of Jos+¬ Lezama Lima as the guiding thread in exploring the possibility of a politicity in which time is imagined beyond the disciplining functions it has had throughout the metaphysical traditionGÇöa time of the absence of time, in which the absence of time no longer means eternity.<br>

  Abstract: This paper assumes a political vision that, not being widely shared, requires explicit statement. The fundamental human relations that determine the shape of ecological, social, and personal worlds are not governed by legal, contractual, or institutional principles, but by constitutive practices. At present, the dominant constitutive practice of contemporary social relations is the global market. Production, distribution, and consumption are constituted for the purposes either of making money or of providing “value for money”—that is, a value subject to public measurement. These economic principles, by giving a public and social representation of diverse needs and impulses, usurp the place<br>

  Abstract: This timely new book skilfully examines the work of the award-winning writer Patrick Chamoiseau. Considered by many as one of the most innovative writers to hit the French literary scene in over 40 years, Chamoiseau made his name with his book Texaco (published in 1992 and winner of the highest literary prize in France, the Prix Goncourt). His books have gone on to sell millions and his work has been translated by a number of academic presses. McCusker sets the author in context, providing a valuable contribution to ‘memory studies’ by looking at literary representation of memory in Martinique, a society founded on slavery but now politically assimilated to the metropolitan centre, France.<br>

The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be playful subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

  Abstract: In the theory of autobiography, theoretical developments in literary studies are clearly reflected. From an earlier mimetic understanding of the genre as the representation of an autonomous and homogeneous self the pendulum swung to the deconstructionist view, dominant in the late 1970s and early 1980s. According to deconstructionist tenets, there can be no representation of self in language, but only an illusion of “self” generated by a purely textual subject. It was at this point that theorists like Michael Sprinker even went as far as to proclaim the “end of autobiography” (Sprinker 1980). Since the late 1980s, however, the pendulum<br>

  Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena to appear in Irish literature since the late 1990s has been the rise of ‘homegrown’ crime fiction. Irish crime narrative has been strong, historically, as a sub-genre, but until the 1990s had largely been concerned with the representation of fictional crime in non-Irish settings, usually the US or the UK. Since the period immediately prior to the economic boom commonly known as the Celtic Tiger, however, a number of circumstances have given rise to a situation in which, for the first time, Irish readers are demanding novels and other narratives which portray Irish crime<br>

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects.

We follow their journeys as they seek ‘community’ and belonging in a world characterised by rapid social change. Imbued with nostalgic yearning, community is hailed as a panacea to the ills of modernity and as a representation of social continuity. Nostalgia denotes the mourning of a lost home or place and a lost time – and in this way – the search for community and belonging can also be understood as a quest for another epoch.<br>

  Book Title: Negative Cosmopolitanism-Cultures and Politics of World Citizenship after Globalization<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): TOMSKY TERRI<br>
  Abstract: From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective. In the twentieth century the world sought solutions through formal institutions of international governance such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the World Bank, but present-day responses to global realities are often more provisional, improvisational, and contingent. Tracing this uneven history in order to identify principal actors, contesting ideologies, and competing rhetoric, Negative Cosmopolitanism challenges the Kantian ideal of cosmopolitanism as the precondition for a perpetual global peace. Uniting literary scholars with researchers working on contemporary problems and those studying related issues of the past – including slavery, industrial capitalism, and corporate imperialism – essays in this volume scrutinize the entanglement of cosmopolitanism within expanding networks of trade and global capital from the eighteenth century to the present. By doing so, the contributors pinpoint the ways in which whole populations have been unwillingly caught up in a capitalist reality that has little in common with the earlier ideals of cosmopolitanism. A model for provoking new and necessary questions about neoliberalism, biopolitics, colonialism, citizenship, and xenophobia, Negative Cosmopolitanism establishes a fresh take on the representation of globalization and modern life in history and literature.

  Abstract: The heart of the matter in this paper is what human knowledge owes to images. More precisely, what does knowledge – even scientific knowledge – obtain from the visual representation of its objects? It is undisputed that visual representations are spatial. But they are not necessarily static. Sometime they have duration. Then visual representations may be both spatial and temporal. However, it remains certainly true that they have a geometrical structure – in 3 or 4 dimensions. Thus, what does scientific knowledge obtain from the geometrical structure of its representations? According to the Latvian philosopher Nicolai Hartmann, sciences obtain the linkage between the<br>

  Author(s) Alcobia-Murphy Shane<br>
  Abstract: Feminist criticism frequently employs metaphors of space to interrogate the position of women within society and their ability to articulate that position to a wider world. The idea of ‘clearing a space’ from which to speak suggests that for women freedom of expression can only be achieved in ‘empty’ space, space that is unmarked by ideological and aesthetic convictions. Yet such emptiness is impossible, since the speaking self must be meaningfully located. Space, both public and private, is closely related to the construction of identity and to its textual representation. This chapter examines the representation of the house by two<br>

  Abstract: According to Lionel Trilling, authenticity ”usurp[ed] [sincerity’s] place in our esteem” somewhere between sincerity’s heyday (the sixteenth or seventeenth century) and today.¹ While sincerity ”had dominion over men’s imagination of how they ought to be” in the early modern period,² late modernity has become, in Charles Taylor’s words, ”The Age of Authenticity.”³ Although both are forms of self-congruence, sincerity and authenticity often stand at odds with each another. Most late modern thinkers prefer authenticity over sincerity for one of two overlapping reasons. (1) For some (Jean-Paul Sartre), sincerity (self-representation for others) assumes a problematic, essentialist conception of the self. If<br>

  Abstract: The Illiberal Imaginationoffers a synthetic, historical formalist account of how-and to what end-U.S. novels from the late eighteenth century to the mid-1850s represented economic inequality and radical forms of economic egalitarianism in the new nation. In conversation with intellectual, social, and labor history, this study tracks the representation of class inequality and conflict across five subgenres of the early U.S. novel: the Bildungsroman, the episodic travel narrative, the sentimental novel, the frontier romance, and the anti-slavery novel.<br>

These adaptations, Lott writes, “could not . . . have avoided making use of blackface devices: minstrelsy was the current material condition of theatrical production in the representation of racial matters.” But while these adaptations thus reproduced the problematic racial politics of blackface minstrelsy, they also refashioned minstrelsy, Lott contends, “for explicit antislavery<br>

  Abstract: Controversial ceremonies on the site of a central monument commemorating the deportation of Jews from Paris in 1942 became the focus of presidents Mitterrand and Chirac’s attempts to secure national reconciliation from 1992. Memories of state persecutions and victims of national policy presented an obstacle to the representation of conventional national identity. The monument and related commemorations of Vichy were nevertheless used to legitimate a cohesive official state memory: by rhetorical appeals to humanist traditions and to nationhood as an ideal, almost religious vocation.<br>

  Abstract: Anna’s night journey to St. Petersburg (part 1, chapter 29) is one of the great transitional moments in her drama. Her experience dramatizes a state of intense moral and psychological conflict in which a powerful passion crashes through a barrier of will and conscience. Tolstoy’s account of this internal experience is remarkable for its representation of Anna’s epic crisis. The battle engages her entire being, physical, psychological, moral, and spiritual, drawing in her immediate surroundings and nature in the broadest sense of the term.<br>

  Book Title: The Spirits of Crossbones Graveyard-Time, Ritual, and Sexual Commerce in London<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hausner Sondra L.<br>
  Abstract: Every month, a ragtag group of Londoners gather in the site known as Crossbones Graveyard to commemorate the souls of medieval prostitutes believed to be buried there-the "Winchester Geese," women who were under the protection of the Church but denied Christian burial. In the Borough of Southwark, not far from Shakespeare's Globe, is a pilgrimage site for self-identified misfits, nonconformists, and contemporary sex workers who leave memorials to the outcast dead. Ceremonies combining raucous humor and eclectic spirituality are led by a local playwright, John Constable, also known as John Crow. His interpretation of the history of the site has struck a chord with many who feel alienated in present-day London. Sondra L. Hausner offers a nuanced ethnography of Crossbones that tacks between past and present to look at the historical practices of sex work, the relation of the Church to these professions, and their representation in the present. She draws on anthropological approaches to ritual and time to understand the forms of spiritual healing conveyed by the Crossbones rites. She shows that ritual is a way of creating the present by mobilizing the stories of the past for contemporary purposes.<br>

  Publisher: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca<br>
  Author(s): SANTOS M.ª ALMUDENA MATEOS<br>
  Abstract: Las fuentes en las que se fundamenta la novela histórica proporcionan, además de una ambientación correcta de la acción, la veracidad necesaria para que el lector reconozca el trabajo llevado a cabo por el autor. Este estudio se centra en descubrir las fuentes históricas, literarias, artísticas, religiosas y culturales de dos novelas muy diferentes que comparten un marco común, el Renacimiento Italiano. Mientras que en Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar (1877-1879) la exactitud histórica se presenta sólo en determinados capítulos que parecen ralentizar la acción, en Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), lo histórico está tan integrado que es difícil detectar qué parte se corresponde con la historia y cuál con la ficción. Las fuentes consultadas por los autores e incorporadas al texto narrativo proporcionan laexhaustividad necesaria para que el ambiente histórico recreado sea preciso. Al confrontar dichas fuentes con el texto literario se observa cómo, además, el marco creado ayuda a delimitarla psicología de los protagonistas, pues, aunque son personajes históricos, los autores crean una vida de ficción a partir de los hechos históricos. Por otro lado, las referencias literarias (correspondientes a un periodo que va desde los siglos XV y XVI hasta el presente de los autores) aportan el marco necesario para que los protagonistas sean portadores de una nueva inmortalidad. La exactitud de las descripciones, la configuración de los caracteres tanto renacentistas como contemporáneos, las perspectivas artísticas o religiosas, configuran estas dos obras en una serie de coincidencias difíciles de obviar.The sources, which the historical novel is based on, provide the correct setting of the action and the necessary truthfulness for the reader to recognise the work carried out by the author.

  Abstract: As a first approach to the question at hand, I would like to consider the significance of the terms “representation” and “simulation.” In the title of this segment of the symposium, we find that simulation is referred to in the historical sense of an “age” and that representation is placed within die context of this age. In this paper, I take the position that representation, understood in the somewhat narrow sense of a referential means of thinking towards an end, can itself be considered as informing a historical age – one that establishes the ground for the age of simulation.<br>

  Abstract: In dramatizing a frozen imagination and a sterilized world, Baudelaire’s rocklike formations crush the life from any belief in the spellbinding or “reenchanting” capabilities of lyric. Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and
                  correspondances, and a fall back into the disjunctive, broken sphere of the allegorical, where matter is but the<br>

  Book Title: The Signifying Self-Cervantine Drama as Counter-Perspective Aesthetic<br>
  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Henry Melanie<br>
  Abstract: The Signifying Self: Cervantine Drama as Counter-Perspective Aesthetic offers a comprehensive analysis of all eight of Cervantes's Ocho comedias (published 1615), moving beyond conventional anti-Lope approaches to Cervantine dramatic practise in order to identify what, indeed, his theatre promotes. Considered on its own aesthetic terms, but also taking into account ontological and socio-cultural concerns, this study compels a re-assessment of Cervantes's drama and conflates any monolithic interpretations which do not allow for the textual interplay of contradictory and conflicting discourses which inform it. Cervantes's complex and polyvalent representation of freedom underpins such an approach; a concept which is considered to be a leitmotif of Cervantes's work but which has received scant attention with regards to his theatre. Investigation of this topic reveals not only Cervantes's rejection of established theatrical convention, but his preoccupation with the difficult relationship between the individual and the early modern Spanish world. Cervantes's comedias emerge as a counter-perspective to dominant contemporary Spanish ideologies and more orthodox artistic imaginings. Ultimately, The Signifying Self seeks to recuperate the Ocho comedias as a significant part of the Cervantine, and Golden-Age, canon and will be of interest and benefit to those scholars who work on Cervantes and indeed on early modern Spanish theatre in general.<br>

As John P. Pittman points out in

The contributors to this volume are concerned with the interpretation and representation of oral narrative and how it is shaped by its audience and the time, place, and cultural context of the narration. Thus, oral traditions are understood as a series of dialogues between tradition bearers and their listeners, including those who record, write, and interpret.<br>

  Author(s): EHRENREICH ROBERT M.<br>
  Abstract: After Representation?explores one of the major issues in Holocaust studiesùthe intersection of memory and ethics in artistic expression, particularly within literature.As experts in the study of literature and culture, the scholars in this collection examine the shifting cultural contexts for Holocaust representation and reveal how writersùwhether they write as witnesses to the Holocaust or at an imaginative distance from the Nazi genocideùarticulate the shadowy borderline between fact and fiction, between event and expression, and between the condition of life endured in atrocity and the hope of a meaningful existence. What imaginative literature brings to the study of the Holocaust is an ability to test the limits of language and its conventions.After Representation?moves beyond the suspicion of representation and explores the changing meaning of the Holocaust for different generations, audiences, and contexts.<br>

  Author(s) McGLOTHLIN ERIN<br>
  Abstract: Since Theodor W. Adorno’s original dictum in 1949 about the supposed barbarity of writing poetry “after Auschwitz,” debates over the ethics of literary representation of the Holocaust have revolved around the problems inherent in depicting, in particular, the suffering of the victims and survivors. Adorno later linked his misgivings about poetry after the Holocaust to his objection to the aesthetic pleasure the reader (or spectator) experiences upon contemplating works of art that portray physical suffering: “the so-called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people being beaten to the ground by rifle-butts contains, however remotely, the power to elicit<br>

  Abstract: We have now seen numerous instances of Modiano at his most subversive. The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be postmodern subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

It was a virtual synonym of ‘colonial’ by the nineteenth century, when the nounexotismeappeared (1845). The newly reified concept had acquired connotations of hackneyed imagery and falsity in the representation of the Other (Moura, 1998: 19–40). This pejorative sense was not to be seriously challenged until the early years of the twentieth century, by Victor Segalen (1878–1919), who attempted to revalorize the<br>

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

  Book Title: Commemorating the Irish Famine-Memory and the Monument<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): MARK-FITZGERALD EMILY<br>
  Abstract: Commemorating the Irish Famine: Memory and the Monument presents for the first time a visual cultural history of the 1840s Irish Famine, tracing its representation and commemoration from the 19th century up to its 150th anniversary in the 1990s and beyond. As the watershed event of 19th century Ireland, the Famine’s political and social impacts profoundly shaped modern Ireland and the nations of its diaspora. Yet up until the 1990s, the memory of the Famine remained relatively muted and neglected, attracting little public attention. Thus the Famine commemorative boom of the mid-1990s was unprecedented in scale and output, with close to one hundred monuments newly constructed across Ireland, Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia. Drawing on an extensive global survey of recent community and national responses to the Famine’s anniversary, and by outlining why these memories matter and to whom, this book argues how the phenomenon of Famine commemoration may be understood in the context of a growing memorial culture worldwide. It offers an innovative look at a well-known migration history whilst exploring how a now-global ethnic community redefines itself through acts of public memory and representation.<br>

  Abstract: If the visual record of the Famine from the nineteenth century awaits wider recognition and exposition, there is no doubt its visual representation fell sharply from the public eye with the onset of the twentieth.¹ As the Famine moved from direct experience to received memory, a consistent and defined space within the public sphere of memory, Irish visual culture and commemoration failed to coalesce until the 1990s. Although this chapter is largely concerned with the historical, social and political circumstances of Famine memory’s revival during its sesquicentenary and beyond, some initial reflections on its public memorialization prior to the 1990s<br>

  Abstract: In the case of an event as extreme as the Holocaust, one could be forgiven for presupposing that the boundary between factual and fictional modes of representation is sacred in its rigidity. However, it is often the case with survivor narratives that this expectation is far too proscriptive in its division of the realms of fact and fiction; as James E. Young comments, "If there is a line between fact and fiction, it may by necessity be a winding border that tends to bind these two categories as much as it separates them, allowing each side to dissolve occasionally into<br>

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  Book Title: The Phantom Heroine-Ghosts and Gender in Seventeenth-Century Chinese Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLIN JUDITH T.<br>
  Abstract: The "phantom heroine"—in particular the fantasy of her resurrection through sex with a living man—is one of the most striking features of traditional Chinese literature. Even today the hypersexual female ghost continues to be a source of fascination in East Asian media, much like the sexually predatory vampire in American and European movies, TV, and novels. But while vampires can be of either gender, erotic Chinese ghosts are almost exclusively female. The significance of this gender asymmetry in Chinese literary history is the subject of Judith Zeitlin’s elegantly written and meticulously researched new book. Zeitlin’s study centers on the seventeenth century, one of the most interesting and creative periods of Chinese literature and politically one of the most traumatic, witnessing the overthrow of the Ming, the Manchu conquest, and the subsequent founding of the Qing. Drawing on fiction, drama, poetry, medical cases, and visual culture, the author departs from more traditional literary studies, which tend to focus on a single genre or author. Ranging widely across disciplines, she integrates detailed analyses of great literary works with insights drawn from the history of medicine, art history, comparative literature, anthropology, religion, and performance studies. The Phantom Heroine probes the complex literary and cultural roots of the Chinese ghost tradition. Zeitlin is the first to address its most remarkable feature: the phenomenon of verse attributed to phantom writers—that is, authors actually reputed to be spirits of the deceased. She also makes the case for the importance of lyric poetry in developing a ghostly aesthetics and image code. Most strikingly, Zeitlin shows that the representation of female ghosts, far from being a marginal preoccupation, expresses cultural concerns of central importance.<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

Social scientists also have a theoretical interest in representational models, as they struggle to gain a general understanding of particular societies and of society in general.

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Radović Stanka<br>
  Abstract: While postcolonial discourse in the Caribbean has drawn attention to colonialism's impact on space and spatial hierarchy, Stanka Radović asks both how ordinary people as "users" of space have been excluded from active and autonomous participation in shaping their daily spatial reality and how they challenge this exclusion. In a comparative interdisciplinary reading of anglophone and francophone Caribbean literature and contemporary spatial theory, she focuses on the house as a literary figure and the ways that fiction and acts of storytelling resist the oppressive hierarchies of colonial and neocolonial domination. The author engages with the theories of Henri Lefebvre, Michel Foucault, and contemporary critical geographers, in addition to selected fiction by V. S. Naipaul, Patrick Chamoiseau, Beryl Gilroy, and Rafaël Confiant, to examine the novelists' construction of narrative "houses" to reclaim not only actual or imaginary places but also the very conditions of self-representation.<br>

  Abstract: Far from providing a static model of artistic representation, mimesis has generated many different models of art, encompassing a spectrum of positions from realism to idealism. Under the influence of Platonist and Aristotelian paradigms, mimesis has been a crux of debate between proponents of what Halliwell calls "world-reflecting" and "world-simulating" theories of representation in both the visual and musico-poetic arts. This debate is about not only the fraught relationship between art and reality but also the psychology and ethics of how we experience and are affected by mimetic art.<br>

In an age when talk of representation has become increasingly subject to both ideological and epistemological suspicion, mimesis is, for many philosophers and critics, little more than a broken column surviving from a long-dilapidated classical edifice, a sadly obsolete relic of former certainties.

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  Book Title: Authority, Autonomy, and Representation in American Literature, 1776-1865-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): PATTERSON MARK R.<br>
  Abstract: From the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, a familiar scene appears and reappears in American literature: a speaker stands before a crowd of men and women, attempting to mitigate their natural suspicions in order to form a body of federated wills. In this important study of the relationship of literature and politics, Mark Patterson argues that this scene restates political issues in literary terms and embodies the essential problems of American democracy facing both politicians and writers: What is autonomy? How does representation work? Where does true authority lie? Beginning with the debate over ratification of the United States Constitution, Patterson follows out the complex literary consequences of these questions.<br>

  Book Title: Neverending Stories-Toward a Critical Narratology<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

  Book Title: Modernist Anthropology-From Fieldwork to Text<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Manganaro Marc<br>
  Abstract: Recent insights into the nature of representation and power relations have signaled an important shift in perspective on anthropology: from a fieldwork-based "science" of culture to an interpretive activity bound to the discursive and ideological process called "text-making." This collection of essays reflects the ongoing cross-fertilization between literary criticism and anthropology. Focusing on texts written or influenced by anthropologists between 1900 and 1945, the work relates current perspectives on anthropology's discursive nature to the literary period known as "Modernism.".<br>

  Abstract: In the 1980s, cultural anthropology in the United States was transformed by a growing body of critical literature that focused on the politics of ethnography. Historians of anthropology, anthropologists themselves, and literary critics have turned their attention toward the writing of fieldwork as a locus of power relations and historical contexts.¹ The text itself, the document that certifies the authenticity of fieldwork, has come under scrutiny from critics who view ethnography not as a transparent window onto another culture but rather as a poetic and rhetorical translation, inevitably partial and contested.

No English artist ever asked these innocent-sounding questions with the acuity and persistence of William Blake, and possibly at no point with more complex results than in some of the large colour prints of 1795.

  Abstract: Rule-making is a twofold process of representation; there are rulers who act officially as warrants of the interests of the whole, and there are mediators who act in the name of more specific interests. In the contemporary world politics can be understood as the interplay of agents who claim to represent the interests of others. As societies grow more complex, people tend to delegate the task of promoting their interests to those who specialize in representation. These specialists may be lobbyists, pressure groups, or political parties. The highest and most encompassing level of representation is indeed that attained by legislators,<br>

To further the first option, de Gaulle and his advisors found three remarkable men – Louis Closon, Jean Moulin, and Georges Bidault – who would between them help secure the general’s claim to lead all French forces committed<br>

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Parcell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Karsten Harries provides a new and long-overdue reading of Martin Heidegger's well-known essay "Building Dwelling Thinking." Donald Kunze and Stephen Parcell consider possibilities of meaningful architectural space for a visual culture, continuing themes they addressed in Chora 1. Further reflections on the spaces of literature, cinema, and architecture include an interview with French writer and film maker Alain Robbe-Grillet and articles by Dagmar Motycka Weston on the surrealist city, Tracey Eve Winton on the museum as a paradigmatic modern building, and Terrance Galvin on spiritual space in the works of Jean Cocteau. Jean-Pierre Chupin and Bram Ratner explore historical themes in their essays on French Renaissance architect Philibert de l'Orme and the Jewish myth of the Golem. Gregory Caicco addresses ethical questions in his essay on the Greek agora and the death of Socrates, as does Lily Chi in her meditation on the critical issue of use in architectural works. A concern with architectural representation and generative strategies for the making of architecture is present throughout, especially in the essay by Joanna Merwood on the provocative House by British artist Rachel Whiteread.<br>

  Abstract: The title, Figuring Grief, refers to the narrative process whereby mourning is depicted. In her textual analysis, Smythe explores various connections between representation and consolation. Drawing on genre and narratological theory, she outlines the development of the "fiction-elegy" as a sub-genre and suggests that the modernist writings of Woolf and Joyce are paradigmatic examples of the form. She then uses these paradigms as suggestive "reading models" for the interpretation of works by Gallant, Munro, and other contemporary fiction-elegists. Figuring Grief offers new readings of specific works and suggests that new ways of reading are both demanded and rewarded by a poetics of elegy.<br>

While the historical Baroque relies on proliferation of décor and a conscious embrace of artifice, it also reveals an organizing logic that goes beyond that specific age (the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries). This organizing logic is a theatrical one, where the space of representation is severed into a “screen of appearances,” and the truth is presumed to reside behind it.

  Abstract: A sustained and systematic study of the construction, erosion and reconstruction of national histories across a wide variety of states is highly topical and extremely relevant in the context of the accelerating processes of Europeanization and globalization. However, as demonstrated in this volume, histories have not, of course, only been written by professional historians. Drawing on studies from a number of different European nation states, the contributors to this volume present a systematic exploration, of the representation of the national paradigm. In doing so, they contextualize the European experience in a more global framework by providing comparative perspectives on the national histories in the Far East and North America. As such, they expose the complex variables and diverse actors that lie behind the narration of a nation.<br>

  Abstract: This book explores alternative cultural encounters with and around information technologies. These encounters are alternative because they counter dominant, Western-oriented notions of media consumption; they include media practices as forms of cultural resistance and subversion, "DIY cultures," and other nonmainstream models of technology production. The contributors -- leading thinkers in science and technology studies, anthropology, and software design -- pay special attention to the specific inflections that different cultures and communities give to the value of knowledge. The richly detailed accounts presented here challenge the dominant view of knowledge as a neutral good -- information available for representation and encoding but separated from all social relations. The chapters examine specific cases in which the forms of knowledge and cross-cultural encounters are shaping technology use and development. They consider design, use, and reuse of technological tools, including databases, GPS devices, books, and computers, in locations that range from Australia and New Guinea to Germany and the United States.ContributorsPoline Bala, Alan Blackwell, Wade Chambers, Michael Christie, Hildegard Diemberger, Stephen Hugh-Jones, James Leach, Jerome Lewis, Dawn Nafus, Gregers Petersen, Marilyn Strathern, David Turnbull, Helen Verran, Laura Watts, Lee Wilson<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Feminine Poetics in the Works of a Late-20th-Century Catalan Woman Poet: Maria-Mercè Marçal-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Vicedo Noelia Díaz<br>
  Abstract: This study focuses upon the work of the Catalan woman poet Maria-Mercè Marçal. It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.<br>

In 1888 a first set of commentaries was published in theWoman’s Tribune.After her 1893 retirement, Stanton took on the project with intense energy. Other suffrage leaders worried that the proposed book would offend the many traditional Christian women who were being drawn into the suffrage movement, and they urged Stanton to terminate the project.<br>

  Abstract: Though relevant to any representation, perspective is a particularly important theoretical issue in war representations. At first glance this is readily apparent, since every struggle, military or otherwise, involves at least two antagonists, and representations of conflict usually emphasize the concerns of only one of them. At the same time, there are numerous journalistic and academic accounts of war that aim for a birdʹs-eye view. For example, a historian sifting through historical sources must deal with many different perspectives, all in some way unreliable since they are written from limited – and often during times of war strategically manipulated –<br>

  Abstract: Elites and planning: at first glance, these two terms suggest an irreconcilable opposition. In fact, planning implies co-ordinating activities and defining long-term projects on a basis of technical criteria. The latter should be more or less imposed on the multiplicity and incoherence of individual wants and goals. The elite, on the contrary, represents an authority delegated spontaneously by groups. The leader is not a ‘good talker’ or even necessarily a ‘learned man,’ but he who proposes a representation of his own milieu and objectives for action in which other men may recognize their own viewpoint and desire for change.

  Author(s) Horton Andrew<br>
  Abstract: Theo Angelopoulos’ trilogy of History consists of Μέρες του ’36 (

In Ο Μεγαλέξανδρος (Megalexandros, 1980), the last film of this period, Angelopoulos adopts the idea of representation not as a reconstruction of things past but as the visualisation of their ability to lose their historicity and be transformed into legends and epic tales. Some scholars (see Bordwell 2005: 143) and the editors of this book consider the film to be the logical offspring of the aforementioned films and they see it as an addition<br>

  Abstract: In the late 1940s, the physician Théophile Alajouanine wrote an essay about a ‘rare group’ of people who had been left with the condition of aphasia following strokes or other cerebral ‘accidents’. Rare because they had all been professional artists prior to their illness, these patients were particularly useful to their doctor because they offered the intriguing possibility of studying the effect of aphasia – the loss or disturbance of the ability to use language intentionally – on aesthetic representation. The literary author Alajouanine treated was later revealed to be Valéry Larbaud, whose right-sided hemiplegia and aphasia had left him at first<br>

From a phenomenological viewpoint, in the photograph, the power of authentication exceeds the power of representation’ (Barthes 1984: 88–9).

  Abstract: They want to put metaphysics in motion, in action. They want to make it act and make it carry out immediate acts. It is not enough, therefore, for them to propose a new representation of movement; representation is already mediation. Rather, it is a question of producing within the work a movement capable of affecting the mind outside of all representation; it is a question of making movement itself a work … (Deleuze [1968] 1994: 8)<br>

  Abstract: The democratisation of South Africa has become widely celebrated. Apartheid, a legalised system of white domination over a majority black population imposed by post-1948 National Party (NP) governments, was peculiarly vilified in a post-Nazi, post-colonial world. By the 1980s, the polarisation between pro-democratic forces and the regime was threatening conflagration of the most advanced industrial economy in Africa. Yet in 1994 South Africa held a first democratic election following a four-year transition process whereby previously warring parties negotiated a highly praised constitution founded upon human equality, liberal democracy, a separation of powers, minority representation and socio-economic as well as individual<br>

A foundational argument here is Roman Ingarden’s discussion of temporal perspective in

  Book Title: Modernism and Magic-Experiments with Spiritualism, Theosophy and the Occult<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Leigh<br>
  Abstract: While modernism’s engagement with the occult has been approached by critics as the result of a loss of faith in representation, an attempt to draw on science as the primary discourse of modernity, or as a hidden history of ideas, Leigh Wilson argues that these discourses have at their heart a magical practice which remakes the relationship between world and representation. As Wilson demonstrates, the courses of the occult are based on a magical mimesis which transforms the nature of the copy, from inert to vital, from dead to alive, from static to animated, from powerless to powerful. Wilson explores the aesthetic and political implications of this relationship in the work of those writers, artists and filmmakers who were most self-consciously experimental, including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Dziga Vertov and Sergei M. Eisenstein.<br>

For Eisenstein, however, the relation between the facts of world and their reproduction on the screen was in some ways more complex.

  Book Title: Post-beur Cinema-North African Émigré and Maghrebi-French Filmmaking in France since 2000<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Higbee Will<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1980s and the arrival of Beur cinema filmmakers of Maghrebi origin have made a key contribution French cinema's representation of issues such as immigration, integration and national identity. However, they have done so mostly from a position on the margins of the industry. In contrast, since the early 2000s, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers have occupied an increasingly prominent position on both sides of the camera, announcing their presence on French screens in a wider range of genres and styles than ever before. This greater visibility and move to the mainstream has not, however, automatically meant that these films have lost any of the social or political relevance. Indeed in the 2000s many of these films have increasingly questioned the boundaries between national, transnational and diasporic cinema, whilst simultaneously demanding, either implicitly or explicitly, a reconsideration of the very difference that has traditionally been seen as a barrier to the successful integration of North African immigrants and their descendants into French society. Through a detailed study of this transformative decade for Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France, this book argues for the emergence of a 'Post-Beur' cinema in the 2000s that is simultaneously global and local in its outlook. Its key features include: A comprehensive overview of the key developments in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France since the 2000s: counter-heritage cinema and the memorialisation of France’s colonial past; journey narratives and the myth of return; the ‘mainstreaming’ of Maghrebi-French directors and stars; representations of Islam. Detailed case studies of key films from the 2000s that have yet to receive scholarly attention, such as Hors-la-loi, Dernier maquis and Vénus noire.

Why do people continue to seek the liveness, the present-tenseness that performance and theater offer? Is the desire to be there, in the moment, the expression of a utopian impulse? Certainly, people are drawn to theater and performance by fashion and by taste, by the need to collect the cultural capital that theatergoing provides.

  Abstract: The symbolic representation of collective identity—an essential communicative element of nationalism—invariably involves the strategic deployment of narratives. An archetypical example in this regard is the creation and transmission of master commemorative narratives. In the nexus of Chinese domestic politics and foreign relations, such historical accounts are central to the internal and external legitimation of the nondemocratic state. By bestowing determined meanings upon the past, which is causally related to the present and future of the Chinese nation-state, this sort of strategic narrative defines the identity role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in China’s sociopolitical development and projects<br>

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters, I have defined protoarchaeological narratives as those in which the past is conceptualized in a negotiation between empirical observation and linguistic representation in a variety of ancient Greek genres. I have also suggested that reading—both as a conceptual category and as a practice—functions within these narratives as an acknowledgment that the past is constituted in what can no longer be seen. To return again to Herodotus’ metaphor, reading refers to the past as a congeries of narrativized objects and events that fades with time.

  Abstract: This book, written in Spanish, focuses on the literary and artistic works of such avant-garde figures as Ramon Gomez de la Serna, Benjamin Jarnes, Antonio de Obregon, Juan Chabas, Rosa Chacel, Claudio de la Torre, Almada Negreiros, Maruja Mallo, Mauricio Amster, Manuel Reinoso, Diego Rivera, and Angeles Santos y Victorio Macho. It identifies the attempt to integrate conflicting epistemological, ethical, and sociopolitical categories as the organizational principle driving the avant-garde novel and art. Seen as a means of escaping the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter, the conflict between ethical institutionism and utilitarianism, and the opposition of liberalism by socialism, this "middle path" manifests itself in the avant-garde on various levels: the theory of representation, the development of the protagonist, and the concept of history.<br>

Cinema engages us across a wider range of our embodied mental capacities than any other medium of representation, extending from low-level reflexes to abstract reflection. Cinema engages not only our visual and auditory senses, in a direct fashion, but also our senses of touch and balance and, perhaps, even those of taste and smell, in an indirect fashion.

An urban design predicated on the erasure of gesture came up against a sculptural practice that brought to the representation of the human body an antithetical stance.

  Abstract: Finding the theoretical space where cinema and philosophy meet, Malin Wahlberg’s sophisticated approach to the experience of documentary film aligns with attempts to reconsider the premises of existential phenomenology. Wahlberg discusses a corpus of classical and recent experiments in film and video in which creative approaches to the time of the image and the potential archive memory of filmic representation illuminates meanings of temporality and time experience.<br>

  Abstract: In documentary theory the phenomenology of the image as imprint and record fuses with the classical index argument, which has commonly been associated with the ascribed veracity of documentary representation. Hence, the trace status of photography and film represents a crucial problem in the ongoing discussion on film and historical representation. More recently, various approaches to the aesthetics and experience of documentary film have dealt with classical issues of image and time, including an important recognition of the affective and psychological impact of documentary representation in film and media. In this context the phenomenology of image and time corresponds with<br>

  Abstract: A certain loss is always entailed in representation. Indeed André Bazin, for whom realism was central to valuing cinema as an art, nevertheless observed: “Some measure of reality must always be sacrificed in the effort of achieving it,” for the more real it appears, the less it signifies the contingent reality it is the record of.¹ Similarly, Lacan notes that something must be lost—broken away—in the making of what he termed the

Montaigne focuses specifically on the defects of human understanding and our need to shift attention away from things

  Abstract: A staple of documentary cinema from its earliest days, the interview may be the one situation in cinema where vision is redundant. The power of the interview as a documentary technique has primarily to do with the temporal continuity between the event and its cinematic representation embodied in the interview subject’s voice. The synchronous recording of sound and sight in the documentary interview presents us, then, with another instance of the confrontation of the look and the gaze in cinema. To the viewer, this gaze takes the form of a question that can never be articulated: if I can hear,<br>

With his “experiment in living,” Thoreau expressed in dramatic and conclusive form the abolitionists’ determination to separate their movement from the civil institutions of the political public sphere and from any positive representation of a people.

This is Derrida’s opportunity to investigate the role of representation in language. “Representation” has a variety of senses, and Derrida argues that through all the registers of its meaning, the “fundamental distinction between reality and representation” cannot be drawn, since in language it is impossible to distinguish them.<br>

It is a matter of “returning” to the question of representation as an explication of the relation between a subject and an object. Let’s first of all recall that, from 1810 to 1850, Hegel and his disciples were the main figures on the philosophical scene.

The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

  Book Title: The Aesthetics of Antichrist-From Christian Drama to Christopher Marlowe<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): PARKER JOHN<br>
  Abstract: The Antichrist myth in particular tells of an impostor turned prophet: performing Christ's life, he reduces the godhead to a special effect yet in so doing foretells the real second coming. Medieval audiences, as well as Marlowe's, could evidently enjoy the constant confusion between true Christianity and its empty look-alikes for that very reason: mimetic degradation anticipated some final, as yet deferred revelation. Mere theater was a necessary prelude to redemption. The versions of the myth we find in Marlowe and earlier drama actually approximate, John Parker argues, a premodern theory of the redemptive effect of dramatic representation itself. Crossing the divide between medieval and Renaissance theater while drawing heavily on New Testament scholarship, Patristics, and research into the apocrypha,
      The Aesthetics of Antichristproposes a wholesale rereading of pre-Shakespearean drama.<br>

  Book Title: War and Literature-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Ian<br>
  Abstract: War was the first subject of literature; at times, war has been its only subject. In this volume, the contributors reflect on the uneasy yet symbiotic relations of war and writing, from medieval to modern literature. War writing emerges in multiple forms, celebratory and critical, awed and disgusted; the rhetoric of inexpressibility fights its own battle with the urgent necessity of representation, record and recognition. This is shown to be true even to the present day: whether mimetic or metaphorical, literature that concerns itself overtly or covertly with the real pressures of war continues to speak to issues of pressing significance. Particular topics addressed include writings of and about the Crusades and battles during the Hundred Years War; Shakespeare's "Casus Belly"; Auden's "Journal of an Airman"; and War and Peace.

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

  Abstract: A small detour is necessary to mark the developments Schmidt underwent before 
                  Zettel’s Traum. In the conclusion to “Berechnungen II,” he projects a new prose model based on the dream. The remark hints at Schmidt’s increasing interest in the dream as a literary means of representation and as a subjective demonstration of personal experiences. The small essay “Traumkunstwerke,” also written in 1956, documents Schmidt’s fascination with the interrelation of literary texts and dreams.¹ In his discussion of Fouqué, the English critic, poet, and philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), and E.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Abstract: Wiederholte Spiegelungen! The paradox of the love-death tradition is mirrored in Goethe’s conception of truth and in the Romantic irony with which he shows that any representation of reality that is free from irony only masks it further. His passion for the truth, however, is an enduring flame, as is evident in the energy he expended on scientific experimentation and in his polemics against Newton.<br>

  Abstract: As numerous critics have pointed out, literal and metaphorical maps and mapping “are dominant practices of colonial and postcolonial cultures” (Ashcroft, Griffith, and Tiffin 2007, 28). Maps are a form of representation (“representational space,” as W. H. New has called them in 
                     Land Sliding), a construction of spatial relations and imagination, a form of control over space in the context of colonialism. But maps are also deployed as a strategy to counter hegemonic models of space. This is a central aspect for postcolonial societies, in which colonial inscriptions, for instance through cartography, are challenged and deconstructed in literary texts.<br>

Ends, means, and resources are caught up in an interdependent feedback process.”
                  12What is significant is Turner’s insistence that social dramas are not merely a representation (oral or written) of discord or conflict in society, and as such only a story with its “discernible inaugural, transitional, and terminal motifs” to use Hayden White’s terminology.13For<br>

  Abstract: Remembering Communism examines the formation and transformation of the memory of communism in the post-communist period. The majority of the articles focus on memory practices in the post-Stalinist era in Bulgaria and Romania, with occasional references to the cases of Poland and the GDR. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, including history, anthropology, cultural studies and sociology, the volume examines the mechanisms and processes that influence, determine and mint the private and public memory of communism in the post-1989 era. The common denominator to all essays is the emphasis on the process of remembering in the present, and the modalities by means of which the present perspective shapes processes of remembering, including practices of commemoration and representation of the past.<br>

Abstract: The book’s eleven essays focus on poverty or economic disadvantage: one piece deals with available data on economic variables relating to crime and legal representation, the other ten directly or in passing endorse or reject the independence thesis. The quality of the essays is mixed. On the positive side, Jeremy Waldron quickly adapts an argument from the overinclusiveness of legal rules to reject indigence as a legal justification for property crime. Stephen Morse usefully rehearses and dismisses prevalent invalid inferences from economic disadvantage to criminal nonculpability. Loren Lomasky’s welfarist libertarian case for subsidizing legal representation of criminal defendants is nicely outlined. William Heffernan’s reliance on restrictions on justifications available to decision makers is a potentially fruitful move. At points some of the essays progress by bare assignments of burdens of proof rather than hard argument. Must dependence theorists have in hand a complete theory of distributive justice? Who must show that notions of authority bar judges from invoking controversial normative theories, at least when consistent with authoritative legal sources? Who must show that criteria of legal responsibility should include morally relevant psychological variables, such as stress, in addition to minimal normative and cognitive capacities? Sometimes the argument is too brief. Because legal rules need not advertise their background justifications, defendants often plausibly can claim that deviation from a rule of property law vindicates the rule’s justification. Thus, against Waldron, it is unlikely that the mere “logic” of property rights prevents indigence from being a legal justification for property crimes. More needs to be said. Brevity particularly mars Pettit’s “republican” defense of the dependence thesis in criminal sentencing. Because the defense requires that criminal sanctions aim at assuring nondomination of victims, indigence can ground different sanc~<br>

Abstract: Group styles filter collective representations; the result is culture in interaction. By contrasting each of our main groups’ style with those of other groups, and with the “default” style in previous cultural theories, this article has shown how groups can use the same collective representation to different meaningful ends in everyday life. The point is not that collective representations are meaningless in themselves, but that a focus on “culture in interaction” helps us understand how the same widely shared symbols, stories, vocabularies, or codes make different meanings in different settings.<br>

Abstract: The 1980s were years of intense rethinking and paradigm shifting within anthropology at large. The new critical anthropology epitomized by Clifford and Marcuss (
         1986)Writing Culturequestioned some of the epistemological and political foundations of the discipline, anthropologists rights to acquire knowledge in certain sociohistorical conditions, and the ability of the discipline to survive on the same assumptions that had supported the Boasian project. The postmodern shift highlighted alternative voices and points of view, bringing identity or, rather, its postmodern crisis to center stage. As the very notion of culture came under attack for exoticizing the Other, many anthropologists found themselves searching for new ways to represent their ethnographic experience. In this intellectual climate, linguistic anthropology, with its long tradition of collecting and analyzing texts, was suddenly seen as a possible ally in thinking about the politics of representation. It was around this time that the job market started to open up again for linguistic anthropologists. Some anthropology departments felt the need to rethink language in a broader perspective and realized that linguistic anthropology could be part of a new dialogue.<br>

This, Calamy says, “cannot but blacken their Memory hereafter, if they should not be clear’d by a just representation.” Though he acknowledges that calculations based on sketchy sources can never claim absolute accuracy, his list of over 2,400 ejected ministers more than vindicates the common assumption as to numbers.15<br>

Abstract: Man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus designates a privilege, one by which man, or rather the one who alone (taking up Leibniz’s formulation) is able to say
         ego, arrives at recognizing, precisely by never himself knowing what, or rather whom, it is that he resembles, who it is who preserves his identity and can name him—none other than the One who created him. I cannot define myself, but, like every human being (and it is precisely in this that we recognize a human being), no one can know me and tell of me except, eventually, the one who creates me. God alone knows and preserves within his own secret the secret of man. Thus my unknowing of myself—otherwise called the impossibility of my gaining access to myself through any idea, concept, or image whatsoever that I may produce, except through the image that another gives to me—in no way signifies a flaw or defect in my knowledge, as metaphysics has so often claimed. Take, for example, after Malebranche,35Baruch Spinoza’s belief that he can hold that “mens se ipsam non cognoscit, nisi quatenus corporis affectionum ideas percipit” (“the mind does not know itself except insofar as it perceives ideas of affections of the body”).36This is a problematic thesis in every respect, if only because it implies that by knowing the ideas of what affects its body, the mind would thus know itself as this very body and, because this body is affected by every other body, the idea that themenswould have of itself would thus coincide with that of the complete extended world. In this way we would instead have to confirm that what man would know of himself would precisely not be himself, but anything other than himself. Similarly, when Kant underscores that the transcendentalIhas of itself only a “gänzlich leere Vorstellung” (“completely empty representation”) and thus that it has “no experience” of itself and that “the transcendental object is equally unknown [gleich unbekannt] in respect to inner and to outer intuition,” wh~<br>

Abstract: Second, if articulated structure displaces verbal connective tissue in argument, the effect of such brevity can be a kind of poverty, an overreliance on mere enumeration as a result of which logical relations fail to manifest themselves at all.
            56Recently Edward Tufte, author of magisterial works on the graphic and visual representation of information, has offered a severe critique of PowerPoint for just this failure. In PowerPoint, connective verbal tissue is removed entirely, and oral presentations based on this skeletal writing often display a version of Ong’s “secondary orality” impoverished of information content, in which argument is reduced to mere list.57Tufte’s critique of PowerPoint confirms a distinction between concision and clarity; the burden of his critique is to remind us that sometimesmorewords are required in order for communication to be effective. There is no easy correlation between the quantity of words and the quality of communication, and this mysterious intransigence of language, which goes very deep, means that it will probably never be possible to reduce writing to rules, schemata, or the algorithms that run computer programs.<br>

Abstract: When totalizing representations of religious identity are thus scrutinized through the lens of a hermeneutic of suspicion, the first step is taken toward recovering the sociopolitically concrete meaning of religious “identity,” “horizon,” or “other” and envisaging the dialectic of theology of religions and comparative theology in a manner that counters forceful discursive closures that produce the fixed binary opposition of the hegemonic Self and the hegemonic Other. First, the comparative‐theological undertaking of dialogue with and immersion in the texts, symbolisms, rituals, and practices of a religious other needs initially to be a political act of both intra‐ and interreligious solidarity that attempts to free the suppressed subaltern voices of difference—women, ethnic, racial, or sexual minorities, the poor, the outcast—both within one’s own tradition and within the religious other being compared. In other words, comparative theology must first be a politically liberating praxis of restoring and enabling the subaltern representations—in the sense of both portraiture (
         Darstellung) and political representation (Vertretung)—of the religious traditions being compared, so that the minimum condition of mutual recognition of identity or worth, that is, mutual recognition of free participatory agency, can be established as political reality rather than merely postulated as ideal dialogical condition.45For this to be possible, furthermore, an inclusivist or confessional‐pluralist theology of religions from which the comparative‐theological undertaking starts must be one that perpetually guards against the sociopolitically privileged epistemic positioning of its rules of recognition in terms of gender, race, class, nationality, and/or the like and one whose totalizing metaphysical desire has enough apophatic sensibility built into it to accept the loss of its positional privilege as epistemic gain.<br>

Abstract: The two images impressed on the shroud synthesize God’s “mythic” presence in human history. In the panegyric, Tesauro contends that God alluded to the Word’s dual nature when he said to Moses “You shall not see my face” and “You shall see my back.”
      50The two‐sided shroud is a literal manifestation of the divine (the frontal side) and human (the back side) nature of Christ.51In the dynamic rapport between the two parts of the shroud Tesauro identifies theenargeiaof divine expression. In Tesauro’s words,enargeia“expresses human actions as if they presented themselves faithful to the eyes and not to the ears.”52The shroud is the highest exemplar of divineenargeia, for this cloth is not a static image but rather (as a mythic representation) a portrait in motion, a figurative discourse that opens itself to infinite forms of apprehension. Let us remember that, for Quintilian, “vividness” (ornatumorenargeia) “is more than mere perspicuity, since instead of being merely transparent it somehow shows itself off” (se quodam modo ostendit).53<br>

Abstract: Frei’s constructive proposal does more than simply advocate a return to earlier “precritical” Christian practices of reading. He frequently argues that the recovery of the literal sense opens the possibility of constructive engagement by Christian theology with the Jewish practice of Midrash. As John David Dawson has recently noted, for Frei, attention on the part of Christians to the distinctive, unsubstitutable practices of reading constitutive of Jewish life should follow from attunement to the narrative uniqueness of the Gospel’s portrayal of Jesus Christ.
      1At first glance, it would appear that these references to Midrash can be attributed simply to its typological pattern of interpretation, which understands the coherence of Jewish scriptures via internal repetitions and patterns of representation, rather than appeal to external categories of understanding. Midrash thus parallels the figural patterns of connection that marked precritical Christian readings of scripture, a pattern of reading that only appeared arbitrary or without any sure criteria of guidance in the eyes of modern readers.2In light of the retrieval of figural reading, Christians would come to appreciate the distinctive form of Midrashic reading.<br>

Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
Abstract: Trying to make sense of the square between the National Gallery/former palace and the mausoleum as a semiotic space, the cultural historian Dafina Dicheva laments the victory of destruction. She notes that, while the two buildings were indeed entangled in an epic metaphoric struggle, their physical presence side by side secured not only a synchronic but also a diachronic representation of the city's historical meanings, like a palimpsest. Transition periods always vacillate between rewriting and reassessment, but one would hope that any act would bring in some new meaning. The demolition of the mausoleum, according to Dicheva, left only a “desemioticized center and the debilitating power of the symbol of destruction, threatening in its insistence that anything can disappear.” In this context, she interprets the subsequent
         Bierfestin the square as a symbolic demolition in the wake of the physical one. It does not invert reality into the carnivalesque and thus integrate culture; instead, it disintegrates culture by transforming reality into carnival, where theBierfestis experienced as total reality. “Destruction does not allow the reconstruction of the social and cultural order. … On the contrary, it is a mirror inversion, which blocks the social and individual experience at the level of anticulture.”91<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: A hermeneutically sophisticated
         imitatio Deiwill therefore resist all too frequent appeals to poetics as merely an expression of individual subjectivity or as its opposite, a representation of a given traditional narrative to be applied and adhered to. Understood instead as animitatio Creatoris, humanity is ultimately responsible for narrating itself over time. Its capability for doing so is presupposed in the fact that human beings tell moral stories and myths at all. The impossible possibility commanded by our own mysterious natures is to imitate our own Creator in creating ever less distorted, violent, and exclusive historical worlds. Those done violence can find herein a deep well of empowerment to work toward transforming the social order. Those who perpetrate violence can discover that social creativity belongs to humanity as such in all its vulnerability, difference, and otherness. In both cases, what is to be imitated, in a hermeneutically dynamic way, is neither a lost nor an eternally fixed moral order but our own morally invisible creative humanity.<br>

Abstract: Other recognition theories, in particular those of Hegel and his followers, have explored important insights regarding the integration of recognition into knowledge. If these insights are right, grasping an object with a concept would engage one’s thoughts in a self‐recognition project that is arguably in line with the “lived experiences” referred to by Ricoeur. The section dealing with the “ruins of representation” misses the opportunity to show how to reconstruct knowledge claims on these ruins. On the one hand, one could argue that a theory of knowledge would simply be sided with a compatible theory of recognition. On the other hand, neo‐Hegelians, such as Robert B. Brandom, would press for profound changes in the way that theories of knowledge are to be understood. It is left to the reader to locate the hermeneutical analysis of Ricoeur in this debate.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If the future has been emptied of its promise of progress, its evacuation from the experience of the present has led to contemporary appeals to a new temporal regime pronouncing the advent of presentism. The removal of futural expectation was a necessary consequence of the end of the cold war and the competing developmental trajectories that had propelled it. Yet the perspective associated with the cold war derived more from a particular conception of modernity, which had successfully and faithfully displaced its relationship to capitalism and imperial expansion by identifying its purpose with the promise of progress in one form or another. The recent demands for democratization must be seen simply as an exhausted echo of this historic displacement, disclosing a narrative that has played out its productivity and whose worn and frayed image finds itself reflected in attempts to position the temporality of the present as endless duration now that it no longer needs to rely on its relationship to a past and a future. What this representation had managed to veil was a collision of temporalities. An exported world‐standard time demanded by capital and its overseas expansion—a new imperialization of time—clashed with diverse local times and modes of existence as it established a world market and instigated colonial expropriation. This is not to say that the spectacle of divided or mixed temporalities did not already exist in the industrial heartlands of Euro‐America but only that expansion provided the occasion to map the instance of unevenness, as denoted in classifications of “delay” and “arrest,” onto the hinterlands. One of the more successful conjurations performed by modern industrialized societies has been to conceal the unevenness within their own precincts and its accompanying, mixed, and often “discordant temporalities” regulating the rhythms of life, making it appear as a problem stigmatizing the nonmodern.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: In conjuring up the conceptual field of such effects, we might turn to set theory and picture a Venn diagram by which narratography is defined as exactly the zone of overlap between narratology and stylistics. Narratography would be shaded in there by the very shadings and incremental gradations of prose in the thick and thin of its own action as linguistic incident. Here emerges, in sum, the heuristic value of a so-called
         Story Left Behindin staging by exaggeration the everyday wake of narrativity in verbal process. Any narrative sentence may have its dramatic prehistory. It need not necessarily be distended or suddenly truncated, not by definition brutal or suppressed or moving or any one thing in particular, and not necessarily longer than the plotted tension of the preceding paragraph or even sentence. But narrative prehistory is manifest as a forward pressure nonetheless. That's why this essay's approach is in fact “narratival” rather than strictly stylistic (whatever that might mean)—and often dialectical as such. And why its instinct for intensive reading comes into sync with the impetus of plotted structure rather than just local representation. And why, further, even in imagining an entire shadow plot, the inflated exception developed in the fictional phase of this essay can still prove the rule of the minuscule. Whole lives, of course, don't usually lie battered, absented, and returned by deformation under the tread of suchfrictionin prose. Broad swaths of plot aside, it is rather in the immediate pace of reading that some aspect or facet of an advancing story is often bent noticeably out of shape. Narratography becomes, in this sense, the tracking of syntax and of the words it marshals for the impinging microplots, one after the other, of their own proximate backstories.<br>

Abstract: Of course we can expand. What does it mean, for example, that film studies has never achieved as much institutional visibility in Japan as elsewhere, when it is a country whose film life over the last one hundred years has arguably been second only to that of the U.S.? There has always been feverish activity among private historian‐archivists (collectors of books, magazines, interviews, and ephemera) and critics (certain newspapers ran powerful columns for decades, journals sprouted from the 1920s on). As for large‐scale studies of the medium, written by professors or public intellectuals, the Japanese bibliography between 1913 and 1943 may be larger than its English language counterpart. In the postwar era, perhaps the name most Western film scholars might recognize is that of the prolific Tadao Sato, as some of his work has appeared in English and French. Yet only late in his career did this autodidact offer university courses. There simply was not much opportunity. With the exception of Nihon University, which claims to have introduced the subject in 1927, one does not find film studies taught within the university system until the 1960s when it was introduced within Nihon University's art department and Waseda's literature program. Waseda boasts a tremendous theater program and library, making it a natural place for the study of cinema to mature. In 1974, aiming to broaden their reach beyond their respective campuses, these universities, joined by a few others (the number has grown to thirty), formed Nihon Eizo‐gakkai (the Japanese Society of Image Arts and Sciences [JASIAS]), an umbrella organization fostering research in film, photography, and television. Their annual conference (where Christian Metz gave the keynote in 1981) and publication,
         Eizo‐gaku, make it similar to SCMS. In the late 1980s they addedIconicsas a second publishing venture, with nine issues thus far featuring articles in Western languages, many by leading Western scholars. Still, s~<br>

Abstract: I would like to conclude by noting that, of course, Coleridge’s poetry offers a particularly concrete representation of the struggles—linguistic, volitional, and existential—that surround the experience of prayer.
         70The verbal paralysis that seizes the Ancient Mariner would be the most obvious and illustrious example:
               While the Mariner does, of course, pass beyond this crisis of language, one must note that release occurs only after he is able to render a strange wordless and volitionless blessing, a kind of secret arche‐prayer that allows further ones to be made: “I blessed them unaware” (line 285). While I would hesitate to map the theory of later decades onto much earlier poems, this is nonetheless a fine representation of Coleridge’s enduring faith that even where “no tongue … may declare” (lines 282–83), something may also be happening, perhaps working wordlessly against language, to bring about being‐for‐God. Moreover, the same juxtaposition of a struggle to enunciate prayer with a corresponding imaginative turn to the wordless also features in many of Coleridge’s private lyrics. For instance, the sonnet “When they did greet me Father” expresses an inability to pray predicated on a lack of receptivity and response to the divine, evoking speech that cannot become speech and words that will not come: “Th’ unquiet silence of confused thought” (line 7). It is signifiers that mark the limits of language—tears and groans—that stand in for what cannot be uttered here and that conclude the poem. “The Pains of Sleep” also expresses a preference for wordless prayer—“No wish conceived, no thought exprest” (line 8)—but, in its latter stanzas, depicts a spiritual desolation that demands a more concrete form of utterance and appeal. Yet the speaker’s attempts to pray aloud are marked by “anguish and … agony” (line 14), and the precant’s voice, like his corrupted will, is alienated from itself: “My own loud scream / Had waked me from the fiendish drea~<br>

Abstract: Revelation of the transcendent is always apocalyptic, but apocalypse is not limited to religious discourse: “For in poetry, language is broken open to let the previously inconceivable appear” (24). The negative capability of poetry is a creative deconstruction akin to negative theology, and this is especially true of modernist poetry that reflects on the limits of its own representation. The result is deconstructive—a breaking down of the idols of thought and speech—but also openness to what we cannot conceive or represent. The deconstructive power of literature reveals and reveils grace or gift, but Franke insists that this openness to transcendent mystery has no positive or dogmatic content. However, to deny this openness as irrational repeats the dogmatism of absolutist belief, and here Franke parts company with Habermas and insists that such openness informs reason. None of us has a privileged vantage point to confirm or deny the transcendent, and reason itself requires an openness that questions the present in pursuit of new knowledge.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: These interpretative decisions assign new significance to Bible translation as a subject of study in the dual histories of Enlightenment and secularization. Sheehan first establishes the backdrop of his approach in Reformation-era translations of the sacred canon, from those of Erasmus and Luther to the King James Bible. While these works presented Scripture that was “extracted from its Catholic superstructure,” they also “invented the tools of biblical decanonization” through their use of philological and historical scholarship (Sheehan, 1–25, quote on 14). A new flurry of translation occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a response not only to renewed assaults from both Catholics and radical Protestants but also to the threat posed by philosophical deism. The original impetus for this work, Sheehan notes, arose in England but soon moved to Germany. While English scholars such as John Mill were preoccupied with meeting the challenges posed by Spinoza and other radical exegetes of the Scripture, their German counterparts sought to reconcile the Bible with the spirit of Pietism. In the translations of Johann Henrich Retz, Johann Kayer, and especially the group that compiled the Berleberger Bible (1726–40), the subjectivizing tendencies of Pietist devotion, with its emphasis on sentiment over formal theology, merged with critical scholarly practices to produce Scripture that was “shorn of all theology and freely available to interpretation by all” (Sheehan, 54–85, quote on 83). Once freed from its theological binding, the Bible could be transformed by “the dispersive media of the Enlightenment.” Over the next half century, sacred writings were increasingly divorced from direct “commands of God” and repackaged as a source of historical evidence, as a pedagogical tool for moral instruction, as a literary representation of German national identity, and as the repository of ancient Hebrew tradition. The Enlightenment Bible, then, established the conditio~<br>

Abstract: At stake here are four factors: (1) Lévinas's conception of Judaism, (2) the role that textual practices have in that conception, (3) Blanchot's interpretation of Lévinas's representation of Judaism, and finally (4) Blanchot's own notion of literature. Revealing the interrelation of these four elements can help us understand both the differences between the two thinkers and how Blanchot's own position on Judaism can be understood as a critical intervention in Lévinas's thought, one made possible by his conception of how literature relates to philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Animals (in this essay referring to all self-moving species, including insects, birds, and fish as well as mammals), as a dominant source for metaphor, simile, allegory, and symbol, abound in literature of all eras. In the Middle Ages, as Jacques Le Goff wrote some forty-odd years ago in
         Medieval Civilization, animals were the subject of constant attention and reflection.10A recent spate of books, all published since 1999, includesMicrologus, Jacques Voisenet'sBêtes et hommes dans le monde médiéval(Beasts and man in the medieval world),L'animal exemplaire au Moyen Âge(The exemplary animal in the Middle Ages), Francesco Zambon'sL'alfabeto simbolico degli animali(Symbolic alphabet of animals), David Salter'sHoly and Noble Beasts, andAristotle's Animals in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.11What has emerged is a recognition of the complexity and diversity of the treatment and role of animals in the medieval imagination.12Rather than simple allegory or moral exempla, particularly after Michael Scot's thirteenth-century translation of Aristotle'sDe animalibus(On animals),13animal representation could include, often in a single case, empirical knowledge, theology, philosophy, politics, and cosmology as well as poetic or artistic ornamentation.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: In saying this, I am not arguing that Marlowe “appropriated” the sacred from its dominant institutional contexts. On the contrary, the rumors of devils appearing on the Faustian stage belie that model of the relationship between the dramatic and the theological in which the theater evacuates the spiritual content from theological forms only to stage those forms within a sphere of rational disenchantment that supposedly frames the experience of a play.
   41Such a model relies on a modern, indeed modernist, understanding of theater as a compartmentalized zone of experience where entertainment has no further end than its own production and consumption, and where aesthetic efficacy, if it exists at all, remains limited to art's ability to contain the contradictions of ideology. Theatrical representation clearly had a certain kind of autonomy in Marlowe's England, produced and consumed as it was in its own institutional space, yet at the same time, as I hope I have been able to show, that very representation could be understood by antitheatrical writers and theatergoers alike as an instrument that had theological ends. Another way to put this claim is to say that theater was not always understood as a disenchanted product of human agency. When the reformers argued that Satan staged theater pieces through the instrumentality of the magician to the end of creating beliefs in the audience that would augment his own power, they were quite capable of imagining that such spectacles were well-crafted illusions without needing to go on to posit that the devil was an ideological fiction. The rumors of the Faustian devils powerfully demonstrate that even representations that announced their own theatricality—even illusions that were institutionally marked out as such—could still be understood as having theological consequences. Those who believed that the devil came when Faustus called him may have been fully invested in their faith, but they were never so gullible as to believe ~<br>

Author(s): Walton Heather,<br>
Abstract: What does this tensional approach look like in practice? A few noteworthy examples illustrate the scope of this collection. In her own essay, Walton destabilizes the conventional hetero-normative ordering of the disciplines. With Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, Walton seeks to reclaim the metaphysical power of the feminine (and the literary) through a genuine “honouring of difference” that stresses “alterity rather than complimentarity” via tension without hierarchy (43). She demonstrates this through brief but insightful readings of Toni Morrison’s
      Beloved(New York, 1987), Ian McEwan’sAtonement(New York, 2002), and J. M. Coetzee’sElizabeth Costello(New York, 2003). Fiona Darroch examines the politics of representation in postcolonial Caribbean literature—specifically, the various ways the literature reimagines the sacred and thereby challenges Western conceptions of the religious and the sacred that persist within comparative religious studies. Finally, John O’Connor exposes the tendency of recent theological aesthetics (following Hans Urs von Balthasar) to ignore or oversimplify aesthetics since the Enlightenment. Theology thereby assimilates aesthetics and fails to take seriously the ambiguities present in actual aesthetic experience—namely, the tensions between our experience and our understanding of beauty as revelatory, including “the possible untrustworthiness of the imagination” (123).<br>

Abstract: It [witchcraft] is not the quirk of one people but, one might suggest, an attempt to explain events and activities, to account for misfortunes through a projection of human agency. It involves economic, political, and moral issues. It is full of surprises and imaginary reversals revealing the moral order through its symbolic representation of the imagoes of both the good and the bad person. The imagined world of witches is essential to maintaining the moral and ethical order of the real world of everyday experiences. (

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: The prominence of figurative language in
      King Learcould be seen as evidence of trauma, especially considering the passage of time between Gloucester’s blinding and his resonant simile. Drawing on the work of Cathy Caruth, who defines trauma as an event that cannot be assimilated by an individual at the moment it happens, Patricia Cahill argues that early modern texts represent trauma not through ocularity but through touch, in particular a failure of touch: “Early modern traumatic representation … entails that which is literally incomprehensible: it cannot be grasped and taken in hand.”
            Gloucester’s comparison of men to flies at the hands of the gods may be such a belated attempt to interpret his suffering and that of his dramatic counterpart, Lear; and Lear’s imagery of his thankless daughters is a means of making tangible what he can hardly believe to be the reality of his situation. Yet even if these characters cannot immediately assimilate their suffering into a cohesive worldview, their figures of pain help the audience do just that.39<br>

Author(s): Mooij J. J. A.<br>
Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores visual response methods as a representation of student learning in a college-level interdisciplinary curriculum integrating art and engineering. The visual response methods, specifically visual journals and postcards, are examples of authentic assessment and alternative data collection methods embedded in a mixed-methods (qualitative dominant) practitioner research case study. In the paper, we focus on different means for analyzing these visual responses (e.g., through hermeneutic analysis, document analysis, and narrative analysis) and deliberate the contribution of diverse analysis methods to the researchers’ understanding of students’ experiences of interdisciplinarity in this course.<br>

Abstract: See Harold Van Buren Magonigle, "Some Suggestions as to the Making of Working Drawings,"
               Brickbuilder22 (in three parts): no. 5 (May 1913), 101–3; no. 7 (July 1913), 147–53; no. 8 (Aug.1913), 174–78. By 1913 the respective roles of drawings and specifications were not unlike those assigned to them in today's architectural practices, i.e., drawings show shapes, size, and quantities of the whole building and its parts, while specifications describe the quality, performance, and make of building materials and products. It is worthy of noticing, however, that these roles had been assumed not long before the period in the focus of the present article. Mario Carpo argued, in hisArchitecture in the Age of Printing: Orality, Writing, Typography, and Printed Image in the History of Architectural Theory(Cambridge and London: MIT Press, 2001) 25–41, that medieval architectural theory privileged verbal and written means of describing buildings over graphic representation. See Ortenberg, "Drawing Practices," chap. 3, on how these relationships persisted in construction documentation until the end of the eighteenth century. Quite a few surviving building specifications from the early fourteenth through late eighteenth century describe building features that we now expect to be explained by working drawings.<br>

Abstract: In nearly thirty densely argued pages, Gottfried Weber (1832) analyzed four measures from Mozart's"Dissonance" Quartet; the "ear" subjects each note and chord to multiple possible interpretations. This paper examines Weber's interpretive practice in light of his theory of harmony, considering his cognitive teasing of potential meanings from the perspective of philosophical notions of consciousness (Kant and Fichte) and the poetics of self-reflective subjectivity proposed by the Early Romantics (F.Schlegel and Novalis) in their critiques of linguistic representation, temporality,and subject-object relations.The Early Romantic conception of irony and allegory brings the subject fully within the fold of linguistic representation, as does Weber,marking a key moment in the history of the representation of listening by music theory.<br>

Issue: i250466<br>

Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Publisher: Society for the Scientific Study of Religion<br>
Issue: i260003<br>
Date: 3 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Woollcott W. Paul<br>
Abstract: Psychodynamically, Augustine's conversion responds to and reconstitutes tensions and relational ambivalences generated by his experiences with the "betraying embrace," principally as he has encountered its symbolic representation in his mother Monica's retentive and rejective tears, in one of her controlling dreams, and in his association with and loss of an unnamed friend. Those experiences crucially affect his own betrayals of secular covenants in his passage to conversion -- covenants with language and rhetoric, with order, and with "lower instincts," among others -- and are themselves transformatively replicated in divine and divinely sanctioned alliances scrupulously structured by his emotional requirements to prevent betrayal: in particular, Augustine's "Romantic" relationship with deific embrace perpetuates in an altered mode the discontent that brought him to seek it.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303097<br>
Date: 4 1, 1963<br>
Author(s): Wellek Chanita<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses the relationship between the Interaction theory of metaphor and Gestalt psychology. Interaction theory views the metaphor as a whole (gestalt), created by an interaction between its primary and secondary subjects. Moreover, this paper develops Interaction theory to require a full contextual analysis of the poetic metaphor embedded within its poetic text. We illustrate this Gestalt-Interaction approach by focusing on a particularly complex poetic text having multiple metaphors (Dylan Thomas's Sonnet VII, from his "Altarwise by Owl-Light" sequence). A representation employing primary semantic fields clarifies the underlying structure of the metaphor chain comprising the text.<br>

Journal Title: Poetics Today<br>
Article Title: Dying between the Lines: Infinite Blindness in Lessing's "Laokoon" and Burke's "Enquiry"<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303121<br>
Date: 7 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Wellbery Adam<br>
Abstract: The essay studies the ways in which death-the word, the concept, and the friction between word and concept-informs aesthetic programs of Lessing and Burke. Both writers turn (and return often) to death as a kind of artistic touchstone and, in doing so, illustrate divergent schools of Enlightenment aesthetic thought. Lessing wants to define and maintain, if only conceptually and only pragmatically, the borders between spatial and temporal representation; Burke, to collapse the borders between space and time, if only imaginatively and momentarily. Lessing, in both the Laokoon and How the Ancients Represented Death, although nervous about the slipperiness of the word death, seems to embrace death's certainty; it is an end, the end, the limit to end all limits. Burke, on the other hand, treats death as "the king of terrors"; he opens himself, at least nominally, to the "obscurity" of death, to the possibility of the infinite. Beneath the surface, though, Burke is profoundly ambivalent about giving up finite, spatialized representation in favor of a potentially infinite temporal flow, and his treatment of Milton's "universe of death" is a fascinating study in this ambivalence. This essay closely studies the tropes-blindness, for instance-with which Lessing and Burke approach death and suggests that their strategies are at root more similar than may appear. Both find themselves in a linguistic predicament, and death becomes for both a metaphor for the strife between natural and arbitrary signs.<br>

Abstract: Johannes Fabian's "Time and the Other" criticized anthropology for creating representations that placed the Other outside the flow of time. Fabian offered the ethnographic portrayal of coevalness as a solution to this problem. This article explores four challenges to the representation of coevalness: the split temporalities of the ethnographer; the multiple temporalities of different histories; the culturally influenced phenomenological present; and the complicated relationship between culturally variable concepts of being and becoming and cultural concepts of time. Based on these challenges, this article argues that some attempts at ethnographic coevalness have fostered a temporal framework of homochronism which subsumes the Other into academic discourses of history. To achieve coevalness and to avoid homochronism and allochronism, it is necessary to represent the temporal frameworks that research subjects use to forge coevalness with ethnographers, and to place these frameworks in relationship to commonly used academic representations of time and history. /// Dans son livre "Le Temps et les Autres," Johannes Fabian critiquait la création par l'anthropologie de représentations plaçant l'Autre en dehors du flux du temps. Selon lui, la description ethnographique de la contemporanéité pourrait être la solution à ce problème. Le présent article explore les quatre difficultés que pose la représentation de la contemporanéité: temporalités dissociées de l'ethnographe, temporalités multiples des différentes histoires, présent phénoménologique culturellement informé, relation complexe entre les concepts culturellement variables de l'être et du devenir et les concepts culturel du temps. Sur la base de ces difficultés, l'auteur avance que certaines tentatives de contemporanéité ethnographique ont suscité un cadre temporel d'homochronie qui subsume l'Autre dans les discours académiques sur l'histoire. Pour parvenir à la contemporanéité et éviter homochronie et allochronie, il ~<br>

realismo, ver Sandy Petrey, Realism and Revolution: Balzac, Stendhal, Zola and the Perfor-
mances of History, Ithaca-London, Cornell University Press, 1988. Dice Petrey: "As exempli-
fied in S/Z, the critical debate on realism posits a dichotomy between radical indeterminacy and
complete certainty. Textual meaning is either guaranteed by an extratextual referent to be fixed,
stable, and unquestionable or detached from every extratextual presence to become shifting,
ephemeral, and unknowable. From the point of view of such critics as Lukács, realism repre-
sents a world ontologically independent of the terms in which it is represented; for Barthes and
Johnson, ontological independence is a myth concealing the fact that representation can never
depict anything except its own artifices", p. 55.<br>

Abstract: Refiriéndose a Jean-Jacques Rousseau en "From/of Blindness to the Supplement", Derrida
ofrece varias aproximaciones a la noción del suplemento tales como: "The supplement adds
itself, it is a surplus, a plenitude enriching another plenitude, the fullest measure of presence.
It cumulates and accumulates presence. It is thus that art, techné, image, representation, con-
vention, etc., come as supplements to nature... But the supplement supplements. It adds only
to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself in-the-place-of; if it fills, it is as if one fills a void.
If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior default of a presence. Compensatory
[suppléant] and victorious, the supplement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance which takes-
(the)-place [tient-lieu]'. As a substitute, it is not simply added to the positivity of a presence,
it produces no relief, its place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness.
Somewhere, something can be filled up of itself, can accomplish itself, only by allowing itself
to be filled through sign and proxy. The sign is always the supplement of the thing itself.

Abstract: This overview of research in the field of anthropology seeks to offer an introduction into different directions and debates on the outlines of anthropological research and tries to relate the discussion in the German academic context to the Anglo-American context. It differentiates four fields: philosophical anthropology, historical anthropology, "Interkulturalität" (inter-cultural relations) and cultural anthropology, and focuses on theoretical and methodological reflections and on interdisciplinary debates relating to literary studies. The German philosophical anthropology with it's sources in the Enlightenment tried to establish an universal concept of what the human being originally is or could be. The historical anthropology has criticised this concept of an unchangeable human nature because it doesn't take into account the historical changes and diversities of the development of human beings. Nevertheless in the German context both fields remained for a long time dominated by universalistic assumptions and critical debates about relativism. Only in the last years philosophical, historical, and literary research begin to interest in inter-cultural relations, in ethnology, and in Anglo-American cultural anthropology establishing a differentiated relation to ethnic or cultural otherness. These fields are also influenced by the "linguistic turn" and the "interpretative anthropology" focusing on the role of language and on modes of representation and symbolising. The overview is connected to a selected (and partly commented) bibliography.<br>

Abstract: En considérant la théâtralité moins comme l'essence du théâtre, lui-même haut lieu de la mimésis, que comme sa condition d'émergence, nous voulons mettre en évidence ce qui pourrait la révéler par-delà le texte et la scène: altérité, imprésentabilité, féminité. Bien que liée intimement au lieu et au jeu de la représentation, impliquant acteurs, spectateurs et décors, la théâtralité se présentera plus comme un lieu de créativité, un espace transitionnel où se joue (de) la vérité. On en en mesurera l'enjeu à travers une relecture intertextuelle de La naissance de la tragédie et de fragments posthumes de la même période, en interrogeant la légitimité d'un instinct théâtral qui serait l'une des formes essentielles du Kunsttrieb dont le destin est de procéder à une métaphorisation de « Dionysos agissant » et à une poétisation dévoilante de la vérité dont l'acteur deviendra finalement l'interprète en cela même qu'il en joue sur le mode de l'absence et qu'il ouvre un texte vers cet autre qui ne s'y présente jamais comme tel. Considering theatrality less as the essence of theatre, which is the high place for Mimesis, than the condition of its emergence, we would like to bring to force what could express it above text and performance: alterity, impresentability, feminity. Even if it seems closely related to place and acting of the representation, including the actors, the spectator and the setting, theatrality will prove to be a place for creativity, a transitional space in which truth can be performed. We will assess its stakes through a second intertextual reading of The Birth of Tragedy and of posthumous extracts from the same period; we can at the same time wonder over the legitimacy of a theatral instinct which would be one of the essential forms of the « Kunstriels »; its fate is to act as a metaphor of an « acting Dionysos » and to a revealing poetisation of truth for which the actor eventually turns out to be the interpret in so far as he plays on it on being absent ~<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'efforce de montrer comment le roman de John Barth LETTERS opère une réorientation radicale de la relation classique entre histoire et fiction. Glissant de la représentation incertaine du réel dans la fiction — et de l'Histoire dans l'histoire — à la notion plus productive du réel comme fiction, LETTERS utilise le discours de/et sur l'Histoire comme une métaphore de la fiction qui éclaire de façon précieuse le fonctionnement du récit. This essay attempts to show how John Barth's novel LETTERS radically reorients the classical relationship between history and fiction. Shifting from the uncertain representation of the real inside the fiction — and of History within the story — to the more productive notion of the real as a fiction, LETTERS uses the discourse of/and about History as a metaphor of fiction which sheds valuable light on the functioning of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: This close reading of one poem by Dickinson, « Crisis is sweet », wishes to demonstrate that the poet makes us share in a multiple experience of crisis combining sexual climax, mystical revelation, and the destruction of the poetic image. Positing a multi-level definition of crisis, the poem shows that the very process of definition — undoubtedly one of Dickinson's preferred modes of tackling with reality — entails a fundamental crisis and criticism of representation.<br>

Author(s): CEREDA AMBROGIA<br>
Abstract: The article analyses the meaning of tattooing as a form of narration. Introducing the body as a text that can convey different forms of thought (derived both from philosophy and from sociology), the author maintains that the body modification is today as an open and living work whose interpretation has an influence on the individual identity and can be changed by means of the interaction with others. A thumbnail sketch of the history of the practice among traditional communities up to contemporary society is drawn to provide a series of fundamental usages for the inscription of the body. The concern here is to show tattooing as an expression of the whole individual (no longer divided into mind vs. body) and of his own perceived identity, underlying the relation of the chosen symbols (and of the symbolic ritual) with society, which remains the main source offering forms of representation and the main stage for the construction of identity. So that the whole final text can be read as the result of a process where the authorship is shattered among the society itself.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i23011305<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Armstrong-Fumero Fernando<br>
Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: Le patrimoine est devenu un terme particulièrement utilisé dans le vocabulaire politique et culturel tout autant qu'il est devenu très usité dans le monde académique. De l'avis de bien des auteurs, tout serait devenu patrimoine. Certains s'inquiètent de cette inflation patrimoniale, considérée comme un symptôme d'un nouveau rapport au temps présent. Cette contribution tente de montrer, en partant du champ d'investigation travaillé par les géographes, que toutes ces approches peuvent en réalité être reconsidérées de manière plus globale. Ce texte pose l'hypothèse qu'elles s'inscrivent dans une chronogenèse, c'est-à-dire une mise en récit des éléments épars grâce à la création d'un discours caractérisé par une accumulation de signes et d'éléments permettant de penser et de se représenter linéairement l'image-temps. En s'inspirant notamment du travail engagé par P. Ricœur sur la notion de temporalité, ce texte défend l'idée que les éléments patrimonialisés participent d'une logique de mise en intrigue, et plus largement d'une mise en cohérence d'éléments hétérogènes, servant à articuler des récits. Ceux-ci autorisent à repenser une certaine unité de l'histoire de l'humanité dans son rapport au monde physique. Heritage has become a very common term in political and cultural discourse, as well as a widely used term in the academic world. Numerous authors have pointed out that everything has become heritage, and expressed concern that such terminological inflation can be seen as a symptom of a new relationship to the present. Based on investigations conducted primarily by French geographers, this paper explores this academic research as revealing a process of "Chronogenesis" (Chronogenèse) : in this, scattered elements are embedded into a narrative, creating a discourse characterized by an accumulation of signs and elements that allows a linear conception and representation of the image and time. Inspired by the work of P. Ricœur on the notion of temporality, this article~<br>

Abstract: Les géographes français ont jusqu'à présent peu questionné leur rapport intellectuel et disciplinaire au terrain. En reprenant l'image de l'Arlésienne, cliché langagier de la présence/absence, l'auteur développe l'hypothèse d'une « fiction » collective, simultanément convoquée mais fort peu explicitée. L'article aborde successivement plusieurs registres d'analyse pour cerner les enjeux disciplinaires soulevés par une démarche réflexive sur le « terrain », objet de recherche. Trois approches sont privilégiées : la place et le statut du « terrain » dans les usages académiques et les analyses épistémologiques de la discipline, les relations complexes entre écritures scientifiques et factures littéraires (le géographe comme auteur), enfin les conséquences de la suprématie du visuel dans le rapport du géographe au terrain. L'article invite enfin à s'approprier collectivement une réflexion sur le « terrain » alors que les technologies numériques modifient en profondeur les codes de la représentation, en particulier visuelle. Until now, French geographers have rarely questioned their intellectual and disciplinary relationship with fieldwork. Using the image of the "Arlesian woman", a French cliché of simultaneous presence and absence, the author develops the hypothesis of a collective "fiction", always evoked but almost never clarified. The paper presents successive analytical levels to assess the disciplinary issues stemming from a reflexive approach of the "field" as research object. Three specific approaches have been chosen: first, the place and status of "fieldwork" in the academic usage and in the epistemological analyses of the discipline, then the complex relationships between scientific and literary ways of writing (the geographer as an author), and last the consequences of the dominance of visualization in the relationship between geographers and their fields. To conclude, the paper invites us to collectively appropriate a reflexion on "fieldwork", when digital t~<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i23508848<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Stawarska Beata<br>
Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Author(s): Gordon Rae Beth<br>
Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Abstract: Victor Hugo's L'Homme qui rit (1869) presents a powerful, nightmarish vision of human longing and corruption. Recurrent imagery of aspiration and asphyxiation ties the romantic subplot, which focuses on the protagonist's divided affections, to a much wider vortex of desires. At the same time, the use of similar topoi to figure polar opposites calls into question the antithetical relationships themselves. This essay looks at the ways in which desire operates in Hugo's text, inscribing the struggle between good and evil within more global social issues. Whereas the representation of women might appear to adhere to the virgin-whore dichotomy, and so to reflect an anti-feminist stance, this dichotomy is deconstructed by Hugo's use of metaphorical lattices and multilevel symmetries to figure his own unspeakable (republican) yearning.<br>

Abstract: THE ETHICAL GROUNDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS FROM THE ENLIGHTENMENT TO today have been almost exclusively centered on the experiences of adults. This essay argues that human rights are not fully "human" unless their very bases are transformed in response to the third of humanity who are children. The essay is an exercise in what is broadly termed "childism": not just applying ethical norms to children but restructuring norms themselves in light of children's experiences. Human rights in particular should be reimagined along postmodern and religious lines, not as protections of autonomy but as responses to difference. This notion is illustrated through the ethics of political representation, including conceptions of democratic citizenship and voting.<br>

Abstract: The Bacchae by Euripides can be read as a heuristic laboratory for the transfer between the Greek "tragic" and the Christian "metatragic", since Euripides distances himself from the unstilled myth of the tragic which consits of Dionysian versus Apollinian duality. What is being sought is a new metatragic hermeneutics, which can only be found in the Chalcedonian relationship between "undivided and unmixed representation", since it is only in a Christologically substantiated statement the wish is actually (and not only seemingly) fulfilled that "Dionysos speaks the language of Apollo, and Apollo, finally, the language of Dionysos" (Nietzsche). This new kind of metatragic hermeneutics, whose substructures are denoted as "mysterium" and "metaphor", is attained by the poetic reinterpretation of the death of "Pentheus", who now becomes a type of Christus Patiens.<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author presents an analogy between the representation (...) of Jesus mentioned in the words of institution of the Eucharist and the hermeneutic concept of the gospels. Based on a "hermeneutics of representation," the former can be described as sacramental representation, the latter as narrative representation of Jesus. This is exemplified by selected passages from the gospels which reveal this concept of representation. A hermeneutical approach of this kind can at least help to overcome the distinction between the "historical Jesus" and the "Christ of faith."<br>

Dans une première partie, nous dégageons une méthode épistémologique originale, qui n'apparaît ni dans la Philosophie de l'arithmétique, ni dans les Recherches logiques. Dans une seconde partie, nous reprenons l'analyse logique que Husserl tente sur la géométrie de son temps, et les analyses réflexives, qui retracent la formation de la représentation de l'espace. This paper is based on the researches that Husserl carries out on geometry in 1892-1894. In the first part, we bring out an epistemogical method, which appears neither in the Philosophy of arithmetic nor in the Logical Investigations. In the second part, we study the logical analysis that Husserl tries on geometry, and the reflexive analysis, that explains the formation of the representation of space.<br>

Abstract: במסגרת המחקר נבחנו המאפיינים והמשמעויות של מאה ואחת מפות של ישראל שנוצרו בין השנים 1978-2001 ונעשה ניסיון לבדוק מהם הנושאים בעלי הזיקה לדת, הבאים לידי ביטוי במפות אלו. שיטת המחקר היתה איכותנית: הרמנויטיקה, המוגדרת באופן חופשי, כתיאוריה או פילוסופיה של מתן משמעות לדברים על ידי פירושם ומטרתה היא להבין ולפרש שפה וטקסט. באמצעות גישה זו נבדקו הנושאים הקשורים לדתות, צורות ההצגה שלהם, הדימויים והסיפרים (נרטיבים) של המפות. במפות זוהה 'סיפר דתי' שנמצא לרוב נוגד ל'סיפר החילוני'. בתוך ה'סיפר הדתי הקדוש' בולט במיוחד ה'סיפר הנוצרי'. סממנים בודדים נמצאו כתואמים את ה'סיפר היהודי' ואילו ה'סיפר המוסלמי' לא בא כלל לידי ביטוי. זאת אפילו במפות בעלות 'סיפר פלשתינאי' הנוצר על ידי מוציאים לאור ברשות הפלשתינאית או במדינות אחרות. ברבות מהמפות האלו נעדרו אלמנטים ונושאים פוליטיים כמו מיפוי גבולות, שטחי אש, מעברי גבול ושמות מדינות ואזורים הגובלים בישראל. נראה כי מפות בעלות מאפיינים דתיים הן בעלות מעמד כרטוגרפי מיוחד בשל הניסיון שלהן לשלב מציאות עכשווית עם מסורת של מפות עתיקות והן מאפשרות להסיק מסקנות אודות מסרי המפה והאידאולוגיה שלה. One hundred and one current maps of Israel were analyzed for their mode of mapping religious elements related to the Holy Land. The main issues of the study were to find out the religious elements that appear in a wide range of maps and their form of representation, the impressions conveyed by the different maps, and the narratives construed from this representation. The applied research methods were hermeneutics and semiotics. Most of the narratives identified in the various maps emphasized the 'holy' versus the 'secular'; the 'holy Christian' narrative, the Jewish narrative, and the Muslim narrative. The Christian narrative proved the most dominant, while the Muslim narrative was rarely found, even in maps with a 'Palestinian' narrative. Religious maps evinced a special cartographic status because of their subjective nature and their attempt to combine contemporary reality with traditional maps of the ancient Holy Land. A ubiquitous finding was the disregard of ~<br>

Abstract: Au Japon où se côtoient et s'imbriquent deux religions, le bouddhisme dont on connaît la richesse iconographique et le shintô, aniconique, l'identification très systématique des dieux et des bouddhas atteste de la porosité des catégories d'existants visibles ou invisibles. Si, pour certains, les bouddhas sont les formes originelles des dieux locaux, pour d'autres, ils n'en sont que les émanations. Cette incertitude théologique rend sujette à débats la présence des entités vénérées aussi bien que la nature de leur figuration, à la fois corps, représentation et substitut. Les spectacles populaires de marionnettes, des objets animés bons à brouiller les catégories du vivant et de l'inerte, laissent accroire qu'une forme de ruse rituelle, le simulacre, permet d'animer une statue inauthentique ou de transformer un corps d'homme vulgaire en un dieu vivant. La croyance en l'existence d'êtres surhumains se forge dans le rituel où substitué et substituant sont soigneusement confondus grâce à des mises en scène humaines ou divines qui dévoilent un monde où les possibilités de transformations seraient autres qu'ici-bas. In Japan, where two religions coexist and overlap, Buddhism known for its iconographic wealth and Shinto, aniconic, the very systematic identification of gods and Buddhas attests to the porosity of the categories of visible or invisible existing entities. If for some Buddhas are the original forms of local gods, for others they are just manifestations. This theological uncertainty allows us to debate the presence of worshiped entities as well as the nature of their representation, both body, representation and substitute. Popular puppet shows, animated objects blurring the categories of living and inert entities, let people believe that some form of ritual ruse, the simulacrum, can animate an inauthentic statue or transform a common man's body into a living god. Belief in the existence of supernatural beings is forged in the ritual in which the substituted and ~<br>

Abstract: Le terme de Monarchomaque renvoie à cinq critères: le rejet de la tyrannie, la double alliance, la souveraineté du peuple, l'obéissance conditionnelle, enfin le droit de résistance armée. A partir de là, il est possible d'établir un corpus monarchomaque composé de dix textes. Ce corpus permet de conduire une étude des liens entre théorie politique et représentation du temps. Celle-ci porte à la fois sur les origines de la monarchie et sur les traces du passé dans le présent (Etats). The monarchomach theory is based on five criteria: the rejection of tyranny, the mutual alliance, the sovereignty of the people, limited obedience, and finally the right to armed resistance. Such a definition leads to the establishment of a corpus of ten monarchomach treatises. This corpus allows us to study the links between political theory and the representation of time. This latter subject involves both the origins of the monarchy and the traces of the past in the present (the Estates). Der Begriff von «Monarchomaque» verweist auf fünf Kriterien: die Ablehnung der Tyrannei, die verdoppelte Allianz, die Souveränität des Volkes, der bedingte Gehorsam, schließlich das Recht bewaffneten Widerstandes. Von daher ist es möglich, ein aus zehn Texten zusammengesetztes «monarchomaque» Corpus aufzustellen. Dieser Bestand erlaubt, eine Studie der Verbindungen zwischen politischer Theorie und Darstellung der Zeit zu führen. Sie bezieht sich sowohl auf die Ursprünge der Monarchie als auch auf die Spuren der Vergangenheit in der Gegenwart (Staaten).<br>

Abstract: This article explores the narrative representation of the desert in Leslie Silko's Ceremony and Ibrahim Al-Koni's The Bleeding of the Stone. In both novels, the physical is transformed into an existential realm, through which questions about human existence are raised. The desert is a microcosm that allows for a re-enactment of the story of creation. It is also the catalyst in the protagonists' initiation processes and the loci for the ceremonies necessary for restoring balance in the universe. But whereas Silko's novel celebrates desert myths as the infallible source of wisdom, Al-Koni's text regards the desert as a stimulus for Sufi quest. يلفتنا في كثير من روايات إبراهيم الكوني النظر إلى الصحراء بوصفها وسيله إلى فهم الحياه نفسها، حيث تبدو مركز العالم، وما سواها هو الهامش وأهله الأغيار، كما أن حقيقة الإنسان هي حقيقة الصحراء. ونجد أنفسنا في روايات ليزلي مارمون سيلكو بإزاء نصوص تستحضر الأرض بحيث تدمج بين الزمني والفضائي، وتبني الأسطورة الضاربة في عمق الزمن واللاوعي، وذلك في اﻵني والمعيش وفضاء الشخصيات المتفاعلة. تحاول المقالة استكشاف التمثيل السردﻱ للصحراء على مستوى الرؤية والتقنيات في رواية نزيف الحجر للكوني والطقوس لسيلكو، ملقية الضوء على نقاط الالتقاء والاختلاف بين عالميهما، وصولاﹰ إلى تأويل علاقة النص بالصحراء والعالم .<br>

Abstract: In Romania, the fall of the Communist regime and the loss of referents that followed have inspired a revival in a "tradition of the nation" whose foundation was laid during the 19th century, associating a representation of identity based on ethnicity with a unitary and centralized conception of the state. The sudden opening up to the outside world, pressures from an internationalized economy and Western institutions – specifically, NATO and the European Union, which Romania hopes to join – have led some to modify this tradition, while others have attempted to render it an absolute in order to better resist what are deemed destabilizing changes. These two tendencies can be identified in the way in which Romanians represent their pre-Communist and Communist past, as well as their manner of apprehending the tension between unity and plurality (ethnic, regional) at the heart of the nation-state.<br>

Author(s): Burroughs Charles<br>
Abstract: Through the analysis of a major religious painting by Botticelli, this article builds on important recent work on Botticelli's sacred art to explore apparent responses on the part of an especially sophisticated artist to the gathering atmosphere of crisis in the city's political and religious life. The artist uses various devices of connection or separation between the viewer/worshiper and the holy image; these devices are not unique to the painting, but their combination is exceptional. First, Botticelli uses a hieratic gold ground to distinguish a scene set in heaven, the coronation of the Virgin, from a more earthly zone; here recent scruples about the representation of transcendence seem to be in play. Second, the figures beneath, four major saints, embody different ways of addressing the viewer and mediating between him/her and the heavenly event. Third, the latter appears to be treated as an apsidal image within an implied architectural setting, in other words, as a representation of a representation. By establishing modes of mediation, then, Botticelli confronts issues emerging as central to the representation of the sacred, in part on the basis of a critical understanding of Albertian picture theory.<br>

Abstract: Cécile et Étienne sont amants. Elle est âgée de trente-six ans, mariée et mère, vit à Paris; il a dix ans de moins, est célibataire, provincial et sans expérience sexuelle. Leur importante correspondance a été déposée à l'Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA) et constitue une source d'une grande richesse. Faisant appel à la microhistoire et attentive à l'analyse des discours, nous proposons de suivre le développement de l'histoire d'amour de Cécile et Étienne entre 1945 et 1960, en s'attardant sur ses prémices entre 1945 et 1949. L'analyse d'une relation adultère vécue de l'intérieur permet de mieux comprendre les métamorphoses de l'intimité au cours de cette période du baby-boom, en particulier les rôles masculin et féminin. Cette histoire singulière permet aussi d'éclairer, par un jeu de contrastes, les représentations de la conjugalité pendant les décennies d'après-guerre — période de doutes au sujet de l'intimité. En quoi ce couple adultère interroge-t-il et contourne-t-il les normes conjugales, tout en cherchant à s'y conformer? Cécile and Étienne were lovers. She was a thirty-six year-old mother, married and living in Paris; he was ten years younger, single, living in the suburbs and lacking in sexual experience. Their vast correspondence, deposited with the Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA, Association for Autobiography and Autobiographical Heritage), constitutes a documentary source of great value. Referencing the phenomenon of microhistory and relying upon discourse analysis, we shall attempt to follow the trajectory of Cécile and Étienne's relationship between 1945 and 1960, focusing in particular on its beginnings from 1945 to 1949. Analysing an adulterous relationship from such an inside perspective will shed light on the metamorphosis of intimacy that occurred during the Baby Boom era, in particular with regard to male and female gender roles. By playing with contrasts, this uni~<br>

Abstract: La presente investigación se centra en la expresión de la identidad a través de la fotografía. Con este fin se ha realizado un estudio comparativo de dos colecciones icónicas pertenecientes a personajes públicos españoles, cuya biografía abarca un periodo comprendido entre finales del siglo XIX y el primer tercio del siglo XX. En concreto, se ha ejecutado un análisis de los álbumes familiares del profesor y literato Miguel de Unamuno y del compositor y músico Joaquín Turina, donde, con una técnica basada en el análisis de redes, se muestra la importancia del estudio de las coincidencias de los personajes fotografiados para revelar el componente social de la identidad. This piece of research focuses on the expression of identity through photography. A comparative study was undertaken of two iconic collections belonging to some Spanish public figures, whose lives spanned a period from the late nineteenth century to the first third of the twentieth century. Specifically, the family photograph albums of Miguel de Unamuno and Joaquín Turina were analysed by using a technique based on the representation of social networks. This showed the importance of studying the coincidences between the people featured in the photographs in terms of revealing the social component of their identity.<br>

Abstract: This essay applies Roman Jakobson's binary system of rhetoric to the representation of death in Women in Love. While Lawrence's novel harks back to traditional configurations of death as metaphoric event, geared to transformations, it also anticipates contemporary conceptions of death as metonymic event, stripped of meaning and devoid of transcendental resonance.<br>

Abstract: Envisagée dans une perspective discursive et énonciative, l'opération historiographique se révèle être une mise en discours du passé et de son espace. En tant que configuration et représentation, elle se fonde sur différents types de mémoire individuelle et collective qu'elle configure par différents moyens discursifs et rhétoriques. Suffisamment compréhensive, elle contribue à l'institution de régimes et de logiques de spatio-temporalité qui, eux-mêmes marqués dans le temps et dans l'espace, correspondent à des régimes de vérité pratique, ayant une efficacité discursive dans le présent. Éloignées dans l'espace et dans le temps comme c'est le cas pour la Grèce antique ou plus proches de nous, ces opérations d'" historiopoiésis " reposent sur des approches anthropologiques. /// From the discursive perspective of speech acts, the writing of history turns out to be the working out of a discourse about the past and its space. As a configuration and representation, it has grounds in various types of individual and collective memories that it configures using diverse discursive and rhetorical means. Sufficiently comprehensive, it helps institute spatiotemporal systems and "logics" that, with markers of time and space, correspond to systems of practical truth with discursive effectiveness in the present. Whether remote in space and time (as in the case of Ancient Greece) or close to us, these "historiopoiesis" operations rely on anthropological approaches.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i25166609<br>

Author(s): Lafaye Claudette<br>
Abstract: Families of squatters who had settled in a quiet neighborhood of Paris wished to send their children to the local school. Our ethnohistorical inquiry explores how the mobilization in favor of schooling the children was embedded in other controversies and mobilizations that arose from the squatters' presence in the occupied building. Many collective social actors (associations, unions, administrations, and politicians) were involved in conflicting mobilizations in an ongoing struggle of competing arguments. The contemporary crisis of the French model of political representation has enabled the emergence of new forms of collective protest: new ways of defining social problems and a new repertory of civil actions, that is, the "mediatization" of social action and the recourse to litigation. Our study suggests some of the possible extensions and limitations of this movement, especially in the context of action taken by teachers' unions and parents' associations.<br>

Author(s): Elfenbein Andrew<br>
Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Publisher: Taylor and Francis Group<br>
Issue: i25597427<br>
Date: 2 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Tourage Mahdi<br>
Abstract: This paper is a phenomenological study of one of Simin Behbahani's better known poems, "Raqqaseh," which is about the nightly ritualized dance of a dancing girl in a tavern. It will argue that the tavern in this poem could be viewed as a cultural container for socially dangerous representations and impulses, like the metaphoric sexualized body of the dancing girl. The tavern could also be viewed as a semiotic register for the symbolic representation of the dominant normative social discourse. By viewing the dance as performance, the communicative association of the symbolic significance of the dancing girl's body and the tavern and its audience will also be discussed. This paper will argue that the reader too is implicated in the performative function of the text.<br>

Abstract: Kearney thus summarizes Kant's "Copernican Revolution": "Being would henceforth
be conceived not as the transcendent origin of meaning, but as a representation of the human
subject—or, more precisely, as a production of the human imagination. This is what Kant had
in mind when he affirmed that 'being is not a real predicate . . . but only the positing of a
thing'" (Wake 157-58<br>

Article Title: Inscribing Subjects to Citizenship: Petitions, Literacy Activism, and the Performativity of Signature in Rural Tamil India<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25619787<br>
Date: 8 1, 2009<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Article Title: O Mal e a Metamorfose em Machado de Assis<br>
Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i25654803<br>

Author(s): Passos José Luiz<br>
Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: El artículo analiza las condiciones de validez del testimonio en ciencias sociales. Sus potencialidades centrales son el constituir un campo de exploración e investigación de acercamiento a la subjetividad, especialmente a la de los sectores populares. Ello ha permitido incorporar sus discursos y representaciones en las ciencias sociales. Sin embargo, dicha incorporación se ha realizado bajo una perspectiva empirista, según la cual el testimonio es una representación inmediata, directa de los sujetos, lo que oculta la mediación del testimonio a través del cientista social, particularmente mediante la entrevista. Por ende, la idea del testimonio como una "voz de los sin voz" oculta el diálogo entre investigador-sujetos, que podría ser potenciado en un tipo de investigación hermeneútica en la que el investigador ya no ostentaría el monopolio de la interpretación. This article analises the validity conditions of "testimony" as a methodological tool in the social sciences. The principal advantage of testimony is that it enables the construction of research and analysis of subjectivity, particularly with popular sectors. This has facilitated the incorporation of their discourses and representations into the social sciences. Notwithstanding, this incorporation has occurred within a highly empiricist perspective, whereby testimony is an immediate representation of the individual. The mediation of the social scientist, which is particularly significant in interviews, remains hidden. The concept of testimony, therefore, as the "voice of the voiceless" disguises the dialogue between the researcher and the individual. This dialogue could be further developed as an instrument of hermeneutical research, whereby the researcher no longer monopolises interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Abstract: Le problème de la représentation du passé ne commence pas avec l'histoire mais avec la mémoire qui a le privilège de la reconnaissance intuitive et directe des images gardées de l'impression en nous de la marque du passé, avec toutes les difficultés liées à la fiabilité relative de la mémoire. Le problème chemine à travers tous les stades de l'opération historiographique: témoignage et archive, — explication/compréhension —, représentation narrative et rhétorique au niveau du texte final de l'historien. Entre la mémoire et l'histoire, l'ordre de priorité reste indécidable. /// The problem of the representation of the past does not begin with history, but with memory. Memory has the capacity to recognize intuitively and directly the images we keep of the impression the past makes on us, with all the uncertainties stemming from its questionable reliability. This problem concerns all stages of the historiographic process: testimony and archives — explanation/comprehension — narrative and rhetorical representation during the writing of the historian's final text. But one thing remains certain, it is impossible to give priority to either memory or history.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27643303<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Jackson Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper charts a policy shift within international and European inter-governmental institutions towards advocating the study of religions (or the study of religions and beliefs) in European publicly funded schools. The events of September 11, 2001 in the USA acted as a "wake up call" in relation to recognising the legitimacy and importance of the study of religions in public education. For example, policy recommendations from the Council of Europe and guiding principles for the study of religions and beliefs from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe have been developed and are under consideration by member or participating states of both bodies. In translating policy into practice, appropriate pedagogies need to be adopted or developed. The paper uses the example of the interpretive approach to indicate how issues of representation, interpretation and reflexivity might be addressed in studying religious diversity within contemporary societies in ways which both avoid stereotyping and engage students' interest.<br>

Abstract: Unification in 1990 intensified the latent preoccupation with memory in Germany. Günter Grass' recent novels testify to the divisive nature of collective remembrance, which is also reflected in the debate surrounding the Berlin Holocaust Memorial. Grass describes a number of derailed monumental endeavors, such as the memorial cemeteries of Unkenrufe, the Fontane statue in Ein weites Feld, and the neo-Nazi Web site of Im Krebsgang. These texts suggest that a memory culture which cultivates monumental representation can be coopted for political purposes. In Grass' literary world, the search for immortality in materiality ultimately eclipses any self-reflective perspective on the past.<br>

Abstract: With the portrayal of local resentment towards the massive influx of Silesian refugees after WWII in the GDR in his novel Landnahme, Christoph Hein expands the literary representation of history he began earlier in Horns Ende, again using the fictional small town of Guldenberg as paradigmatic for the GDR, extended here over time to include unified Germany. Bernhard Haber's epic, but unscrupulous struggle to overcome the will of his neighbors for him to fail provides the backdrop for Hein's depiction of how the past unavoidably writes the future and how the collective process of socialization shapes meanings and values. Using five narrators, Hein applies his earlier concept of social autobiography to trace historical developments in the acquired collective attitudes of Germans towards Gypsies, Poles, the handicapped, and African and Vietnamese workers left behind after unification, all of whom were subjected to the same abusive language and discrimination directed at the refugees.<br>

Georges Lavau, "L'électeur devient-il individualiste?", en Leca y Birnbaum (eds.), op. cit., pp.
301-329. Rawls se inspira en Silbey y distingue lo razonable de lo racional, considerando que
el primer comportamiento integra una dimensión ética que es inherente a tomar en cuenta
al otro. En este sentido, el agente racional está desprovisto, según Rawls, de "esta modalidad
ética subyacente en el deseo de participar en un proceso de cooperación justo {fair), y de ha-
cerlo en términos que los otros, en tanto iguales, puedan razonablemente aceptar'. John Rawls, "Las ca-

Abstract: El texto póstumo de Maurice Halbwachs, titulado "L'expression des émotions et la société" (1947), presenta un triple interés entre otros. 1) Al descubrir la obligación social de sentir y la influencia de los grupos sociales, Maurice Halbwachs se convierte a la vez en digno sucesor de Durkheim, cercano colaborador de Marcel Mauss y también fino lector de Weber y de Simmel. 2) Al tratar la cuestión de la transmisión de las emociones, el autor reencuentra los problemas de la mémoire collective, eje de su obra, y trata la cuestión de la emoción en una temporalidad que afecta a la misma existencia y, más allá, a la transmisión intergeneracional. 3) Al insistir sobre la formalidad y la eficacia de las prácticas rituales para comprender "la expresión de las emociones", Maurice Halbwachs ofrece finalmente las vías de una posible superación de las oposiciones clásicas entre ritos y emociones o entre expresión y representación. /// The posthumous text by Maurice Halbwachs, "L'expression des émotions et la société" (1947), presents more than a triple interest. 1) When discovering the social obligation of feeling and the influence of social groups, Maurice Halbwachs becomesat the same time a worthy Durkheim successor, a close Marcel Mauss collaborator and a fine Weber and de Simmel reader. 2) Dealing with the question of transmission of emotions, the author reviews again the problems of la mémoire collective, axis of his work, and approaches the question of emotion in a temporality affecting existence itself and, beyond, the intergenerational transmission. 3) When insisting on the formality and efficiency of ritual practices to comprehend "the expression of emotions", Maurice Halbwachs offers at last the ways of a possible superation of the classical oppositions between rites and emotions or between expression and representation.<br>

Article Title: The methodological significance of scientific metaphor<br>
Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i27823295<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Yiyu Liu<br>
Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i212608<br>

Author(s): Pepper Chunglin<br>
Abstract: This paper considers some aspects of the early history of the American contribution to the International Biological Programme (IBP), ecology's only venture into 'Big Science'. It is argued that American ecologists were successful in obtaining generous funding for the IBP from the US Congress, thanks to a shared understanding of the way in which controlling nature was to be accomplished, expressed in the metaphor of the 'cybernetic machine'. To support this argument, a literary analysis is performed on Congressional documents, on scientific and popular books and papers by ecologists, and on writings of the environmental movement. The paper explores how a dominant representation of nature, or mentalité, is brought about, and its political effects.<br>

Abstract: "We witness the strategies by which
... radical sects were brought in from the visionary fringes to... areas of orthodox
self-representation.... [T]he visionary power of the heterodox self is recoded... to
be inscribed within the orthodox social identity... in such a way that it reveals the
latter as a lower nature within the one person.... The tradition sustains its 'power'
behind the appearance of conformity" (ibid. 191)<br>

Abstract: Le seul fait de déclarer son activité peut faire problème lorsque celle-ci s'inscrit non dans le régime occupationnel de l'emploi, du métier ou de la profession, mais dans celui de la vocation, comme c'est le cas pour les écrivains. Cet article cherche à expliciter les raisons pour lesquelles l'auto-déclaration de profession peut être aussi problématique pour les écrivains. A cette fin sont mis en évidence les paramètres organisant de façon générale l'identité professionnelle telle qu'elle est vécue et construite par les sujets: non seulement la représentation de soi telle que la réalise la déclaration de profession, mais aussi la désignation par autrui et l'auto-perception du sujet. Cette recherche s'inscrit ainsi à la fois dans une sociologie des professions artistiques et dans une sociologie de l'identité, ce qui permet de conférer à cette dernière notion une acception rigoureuse et donc utilisable par les sciences sociales. /// Declaring an activity can in itself be a problem if that activity does not belong to the occupational regime of employment, career or profession, but to that of a vocation, as is the case for writers. This article is an attempt to explain the reasons why self declaration of a profession can cause so many problems for a writer. The article deals with the parameters which go to form a professional identity as it is seen and developed by the subjects: a personal representation formed by the professional declaration as well as the designation made by other people and how it is perceived by the subject. This research is both part of a sociology on the artistic profession and of a sociology on identity which means that this notion can be given firm signification and may thus be used by social sciences. /// Allein die Tatsache seine Beschäftigung anzugeben kann ein Problem darstellen, wenn diese Beschäftigung nicht in den Arbeitsrahmen des Angestellten, des Gewerbs- oder Berufstätigen fällt, sondern in die Berufung wie es bei den Schriftstellern~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i370115<br>
Date: 9 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Wrigley Trevor J.<br>
Abstract: In this article, I reflect upon and attempt to understand the changing theoretical nature of post-World War II Anglo-American economic geography. In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the "cultural turn" or the "new economic geography." I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i371617<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Michael<br>
Abstract: The last thirty years have brought about a fundamental revision of historical epistemology. So intense a concentration on the nature of history as a form of inquiry has diminished attention given to the thing that history inquires into: the nature of the past itself. Too readily, that entire domain has turned into a place for dreams, as Hayden White put it: a lost world only available now through the imagination of the author and subject to aesthetic whim. The next thirty years will, I propose, be the period in which ontology returns to the center of historical theory. And nothing short of the reconceptualization of the past-indeed of time itself-must be its objective. It must achieve that objective, moreover, in establishing arguments that are congruent with what revisions of epistemology have taught us about the limits of historical knowledge and the inevitability of textual representation. This paper enters this field by discussing some of the issues involved in rethinking the place of time in historical constructions since Bergson. It demonstrates the confusions inherent in spatial reductions of temporality, which historians have done so much to entrench rather than eradicate, and argues that historians have yet to accommodate the fundamental conceptual shifts inaugurated by Heidegger. It then moves to propose a methodological doctrine to which I have given the name "chronism" and seeks to sketch the utility of such a doctrine for bringing one form of presence-that of authenticity-back into the domain of historical study. Doing so invites a number of conceptual and practical difficulties that the paper will address in its conclusions; these may disturb those who have closed their minds to anything beyond the present. Taking ontology seriously interferes both with structuralist assumptions about the nothingness of time and with some of the styles of historical representation that have become fashionable in the postmodern climate. There may be painful lessons to b~<br>

Author(s): Buurma Rachel Sagner<br>
Abstract: This essay considers the persistence of collective and corporate models of literary authority within late-Victorian literature and print culture. While modern critics often understand Victorian authorship to be individually centered and governed by a dynamic of secrecy and disclosure, the periodical debates about anonymity that intensified in the fin de siècle suggest that Victorian readers and writers embraced a more flexible, collective notion of authorship. The plot, language, and paratext of Mary Elizabeth Hawker's pseudonymously published Mademoiselle Ixe, as well as the author-publisher correspondence concerning the novel, offer a representation of the corporate and collective interpretive modes that would have been familiar to late-Victorian readers, if not to recent critics. Hawker's text and the archival material it brings to light also suggest that modern readers might productively turn to the Victorian past to expand the definitions of authorship that circulate throughout nineteenth-century scholarship today.<br>

Abstract: O estruturalismo levistraussiano tern urn vasto alcance critico em relação ao conceitochave da filosofia do conhecimento que é a razão. Alicerçando a racionalidade num inconsciente universal, num sistema formal categórico, e postulando urn isomorfismo entre a natureza e a cultura, Lévi-Strauss faz uma critica nova da razão humana. Esta não pode ser concebida como consciência, como representação, tão ao gosto do racionalismo moderno e de algumas filosofias contemporàneas, nem perspectivada dialectica e temporalmente, como o fazem o positivismo e o hegelianismo. /// Levi-Strauss' structuralism strongly criticizes "reason", a key-concept in the philosophy of knowledge. Grounding rationality upon a universal unconscious and upon a categorical formal system, and postulating an isomorphism between nature and culture, Strauss produces a new criticism of human reason. Reason can no longer be conceived as it is both in modern rationalism and in some contemporary philosophical trends, as consciousness, as representation. Nor can it be thought of from either a temporal or a dialectical point of view, as it is in positivism and in hegelianism.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40019046<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Urban Martina<br>
Abstract: In his early interpretation and representation of the oral teachings of the Hasidic masters, Martin Buber engaged in issues pertinent to the critique of language (Sprachkritik,) of the fin-de-siècle. Associated pre-eminently with Fritz Mauthner and his circle, the critique of language (Sprachkritik) questioned the epistemological status of language, wedded as it is to the divisive Erfahrungswelt. By drawing attention to ecstatic speech, which paradoxically gives expression to the experience (Erlebnis) of the ineffable unity of existence, Buber adumbrates a solution to the cognitive limitations of language. Refracted through Lebensphilosophie, he distinguishes between language as bound to Erfahrung and speech as nurtured by Erlebnis. Whereas language is propelled by conceptual and propositional forms of cognition, speech, principally sustained by metaphors evoked by an experience of the noumenal. Through an examination of his interpretive translation of a well-known Hasidic parable, this article explores how he amplifies this distinction by means of a semantic transformation of the key mystical metaphor of 'ahizat ' enayim (lit. seizing the eyes). Discerning the hermeneutical layers of Buber's rendition of the parable, we argue that his own ambiguous propositional casting of the metaphor entraps him into the very problem he sought to overcome. /// O presente artigo tem como ponto de partida o facto de que na interpretação e representação que dos mestres do Hasidismo fez logo na primeira fase da sua actividade como intelectual, Martin Buber assumiu como próprias questões especialmente pertinentes para uma crítica da linguagem (Sprachkritik) típica da época fin-de-siècle. Associada de modo particular a Fritz Mauthner e ao seu círculo, a Sprachkritik interrogava-se sobretudo acerca do estatuto epistemológico da linguagem, conectada como ela estava com uma Erfahrungswelt que era, desde logo, fonte de divisão. Nesse sentido, a autora do artigo defende que ao chamar a aten~<br>

Abstract: La ciudad habla a sus habitantes. En este artículo se presenta a la ciudad como texto, susceptible de distintas lecturas. Este nivel significativo orienta los comportamientos urbanos, da cuenta de su trama social y contiene las huellas de las decisiones históricas que incidieron en su construcción. En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Abstract: We presented a model which describes the field of questions on identity as a field of dynamics. It is structured by means of particular, temporal configurations of identity through time and space. The theory of dynamic systems provides us with precise models for the representation of forms of identity, or of their evolution towards types of so-called chaos, given certain conditions. The model allows us to work in a comparative perspective, which is a sure advantage in conflict analysis. The complexity of identity phenomena is captured covering individual, group and community dynamics of identity.<br>

Abstract: Si certaines formes-sonate ou certains Andante de Mozart et Beethoven ont la réputation d'être « dramatiques » et de porter une expression fondée sur l'opposition entre tension et détente, est-il possible d'y détecter des règles narratives ? C'est la question à laquelle l'article tente de répondre, en se servant du modèle taxinomique proposé par A. J. Greimas. L'articulation des signifiés à l'intérieur d'un micro-univers sémantique est décrite au travers de la représentation de certains types de passion et de caractères musicaux (topiques, topoï, affects, etc.) détectés dans les œuvres de Mozart par Jozsef Ujfalussy. L'analyse de « la forme du contenu » , c'est-à-dire de la structure des signifiés dans un mouvement de symphonie de Mozart (le premier mouvement de la Symphonie en ut majeur, KV 338) ou de sonate de Beethoven (le deuxième mouvement de la Sonate op. 2 n°3) à l'aide du vocabulaire expressif codifié de l'époque, permet de démontrer la présence quasi « littérale » des rapports de contradiction, contrariété et de présupposition décrits par le fameux « carré sémiotique » de Greimas. On y découvre l'existence symbolique, dans ces mouvements d'œuvres instrumentales, des deux grandes classes de récit de la Sémantique structurale de Greimas, en fonction du maintien ou du refus de la situation de départ. If some sonata forms or some Andantes by Mozart or Beethoven can be described as « dramatic » , and cany an expression based on tension and relaxation, is it possible to detect in them narrative rules ? This is the question which the present article tries to answer, on the basis of the taxinomic model proposed by A. J. Greimas. The articulation of signified within a semantic micro-universe is described through the representation of types of passion and of musical characters detected in Mozart's works by Jozsef Ujfalussy. The analysis of the « content forms » , i.e. of the structure of signified in a Symphony movement by Mozart (KV 338, first movement) or in a sona~<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative, based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The article highlights the structural features of narrative—basically, the organization of the genre around the semantic template actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet, such as time and space of action—and shows how to implement this structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism, 1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from Newton to Goethe—and the quality versus quantity debate—to Goethe and Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that Meiji Shrine Memorial Art Gallery (Meiji Jingū Seitoku Kinen Kaigakan) was constructed as a mnemonic space, and that its construction concerned the making of history. The purpose of the gallery was to provide a historical narration of the Meiji period through 80 paintings depicting Emperor Meiji's life. It took over 20 years from the initial planning of the gallery to its completion in 1936 and, throughout the course of its creation, different acts of remembering took place both inside and outside the space of the gallery. It was the lengthy process of gallery construction, rather than the place itself that shaped what was to be remembered. Historiographers and painters strove to portray "real" history in the gallery's paintings. Historiographers investigated historical facts and determined the gallery's picture topics. Importantly, most of them were responsible for compiling two national historiographies, Dai Nihon ishin shiryō in the Ministry of Education and Meiji tennōki in the Imperial Household Agency. For the painters, the challenge lay in determining "realistic" styles of painting adequate to the representation of "real" history. Furthermore, physical constructors of the gallery played a part in perfecting its narrative structure, such as spatial arrangement of the pictures. The contrast between the expectations of the gallery's creators and the experience of the visitors, in terms of how the gallery was viewed as well as how it was to be viewed, is also the subject of this paper.<br>

Abstract: In common usage, historical distance refers to a position of detached observation made possible by the passage of time. Understood in these terms, distance has long been regarded as essential to modern historical practice, but this conception narrows the idea of distance and burdens it with a regulatory purpose. I argue that distance needs to be reconceived in terms of the wider set of engagements that mediate our relations to the past, as well as the full spectrum of distance-positions from near to far. Re-imagined in these terms, distance sheds its prescriptiveness and becomes a valuable heuristic for examining the history of historical representation. When distance is studied in relation to the range of mediations entailed in historical representation, it becomes evident that the plasticities of distance/proximity are by no means limited to gradients of time; rather, temporality is bound up with other distances that come from our need to engage with the historical past as (simultaneously) a realm of making, oí feeling, of doing, and of understanding. Thus for every historical work, we need to consider at least four basic dimensions of representation as they relate to the problem of mediating distance: 1. the genres, media, and vocabularies that shape the history's formal structures of representation; 2. the affective claims made by the historical account, including the emotional experiences it promises or withholds; 3. the work's implications for action, whether of a political or moral nature; and 4. the modes of understanding on which the history's intelligibility depends. These overlapping, but distinctive, distances—formal, affective, ideological, and conceptual—provide an analytic framework for examining changing modes of historical representation.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo analiza la disputa sobre cuál sería la representación literaria más eficaz que José María Arguedas establece con los autores del llamado boom latinoamericano en los Diarios de El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo. En una argumentación que desarrolla ideas semejantes a las propuestas por Walter Benjamin en su ensayo "El narrador", Arguedas destaca el valor de una narradora oral como Carmen Taripha sobre los logros literarios del más significativo escritor del boom, Gabriel García Márquez. Lo importante para la representación literaria en Arguedas será la transmisión de experiencia, algo que su última novela logrará bajo la forma del testimonio de su propia muerte. This article examines the dispute regarding what would be the most effective literary representation that José María Arguedas established with the authors of the so-called Latin American boom, in the Diaries of The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below. In an argument that develops ideas similar to those proposed by Walter Benjamin in his essay "The Storyteller," Arguedas stresses the value of the storyteller Carmen Taripha over the literary achievements of the most significant writer of the boom, Gabriel García Márquez. What is important for the literary representation in Arguedas is the transmission of experience, something that his latest novel achieved in the form of the testimony of his own death.<br>

Abstract: The construction of a meta-discourse in order to describe interior monologues (IM) cuts across narratologic and linguistic approaches. It varies according to whether the purpose is to establish a typology based on their wider representation or to provide a linguistic analysis restricted to reported speech. The paper highlights the persistent under-rating of a phenomenon close to the IM, and related to the "unspeakable sentence", that of "the point of view". The represented "point of view" and the free indirect speech have coexisted since the second half of the 19th. However, unlike as in the IM, these forms are not clearly differentiated as dual forms of the expression of the inner speech. Consequently, inner speech (at least as a theory issued from literary experience) is reduced to the relatively homogeneous form of the "interior speech" or "flow of consciousness". But this representation is under the influence of enormous tensions as literary manifestations of inner speech are more varied than the phrase IM gives to understand.<br>

Abstract: Any praxis is inscribed in time. To what extent does man's perception of time leave an inprint on Saussurian 'langue' ? Revisiting a well-beaten track in linguistic studies, we propose to give this farreaching question a partial answer concerning the opposition between French imparfait and passé simple. We first capture the opposition between those two tenses in a passive way, in which man as a subject (subjected to...) bears witness to the flow of time from future to past; we then capture the opposition in an active way, in which man as a project bears witness to the flow of time from past to future. This two-fold representation bears on the opposition between imperfect and simple past. It is shown next that linguistic theories view tenses as markers of localisation in time whereas verb forms also help mark how the time implied by the process is viewed, what orientation is given to it. Our contention is that implied time is represented in a downward fashion (particularisation) with imperfect and in an upward fashion (generalisation) with simple past.<br>

Abstract: El artículo propone una lectura de la novela de Antonio Gil, Cosa mentale (1994), como construcción artificiosa del pasado a través de la puesta en juego de los procedimientos pictóricos aplicados a la poesía. El dictum horaciano ut pictura poiesis será revisado a partir del registro delirante y experimental de una novela que indaga en las maneras de configurar el pasado histórico recurriendo a temporalidades alternativas al tiempo de la modernidad histórica. De esta manera, según un criterio analógico, es posible identificar retóricas de la imagen y de la representación a nivel narrativo, en correspondencia con la narratividad pictórica. Finalmente, se entrega una interpretación sobre la perspectiva transhistórica del narrador que permitiría entender las anacronías narrativas como rupturas entre tiempo de la modernidad y tiempo del mito. This article proposes a reading of the Antonio Gil's novel, Cosamentale (1994), as an artificial construction of the past through the pictorial procedures applied to poetry. Horatio's dictum ut pictura poiesis will be revised on the basis of this delirious and experimental novel that explores a ways to configure the historic past resorting to alternatives temporalities in respect of historical modernity time. In this way, according to an analogical criterion, we identified rhetorics of the image and the representation in the narrative level, in correspondence with the pictorial narrative. Finally, we give an interpretation about the transhistoric perspective of the narrator that explains narrative anachronisms between the time of modernity and the time of the myth.<br>

Abstract: This article deals with the problem of text and ¡ mage in contemporary art, as exemplified in a photograph by Jeff Wall called The Storyteller (1986). This image is analysed, taking as reference Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe as well as Walter Benjamin's essay of 1936 on the subject of the narrator. The main points in this comparative analysis are the role of the narrator both in text and image, oral tradition versus visual space, the concept of the picture and the tradition of story representation. The author proposes the idea that modernity introduced a major change in the art of storytelling and in the narrative function of image.<br>

Author(s): Bílek Petr A.<br>
Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Author(s): Bohnekamp Dorothea<br>
Abstract: On sait combien l'Allemagne fédérale a construit sa légitimité démocratique sur le traitement de la mémoire de la Shoah. Mais comment la communauté juive présente dans le pays a-t-elle reçu cette mémoire ? Cet article tente de répondre a cette question en s'appuyant notamment sur la presse judéo-allemande et en dressant une chronologie depuis la guerre. Dorothea Bohnekamp montre comment, apres la désillusion des communautes juives apres 1945 face à l'absence d'intérêt manifeste par les autorités à leur endroit, 1952 représente un tournant, quand l'attention portee à la vie juive en Allemagne devient un critère d'évaluation de la democratisation de la RFA. L'après-1989 constitue une nouvelle étape, avec l'arrivée massive de Juifs russophones renouvelant la vie communautaire. Toutefois les debats passionnés sur le Musée juif de Berlin ou sur le Mémorial de l'Holocauste invitent à se demander dans quelle mesure les Juifs vivant en Allemagne ne sont pas en définitive dépossédés de la mémoire de la Shoah au profit des descendants des bourreaux. Centrale au sein de la culturelle mémorielle allemande, la mémoire de la Shoah reste un imperatif politique fort en République fédérale allemande, dont Pidentite democratique s'est construite en opposition absolue au nazisme. Après le déni des crimes nazis dans l'après-guerre, la réactivation du passé depuis les annees 1970 participe d'une représentation politique du judaïsme considérée comme symbole de la culture républicaine du pays. Or, les nombreuses expressions de la culture mémorielle en Allemagne (musées, mémoriaux, etc.) ont souvent été sujet à polémique, dans la mesure où leur utilisation publique reflète aussi la difficulté à imprimer une logique collective à des souvenirs traumatiques irréductiblement individuels. Si les communautés judéo-allemandes renaissent depuis la Réunification, elles ne se sentent pas toujours pleinement représentees par la culture memorielle officielle et restent réfractaires a toute instrumenta~<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113416<br>
Date: 10 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Burgan Mary<br>
Abstract: Despite recent critical denigrations of the representation of temporality as a defining interest in narrative, it is important to reappraise the epiphany as a feature of the short stories of "founding" modernist women writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Nevertheless, the association of the epiphanic story with "feminine" writing drove a writer like Doris Lessing to reject the epiphany as an organizing principle in her stories; she chose, instead, the more fabular, allegorical model of a writer like D. H. Lawrence. Finally, however, Lessing, like other women writers of the short story, kept in touch with the intuition of revelation in moments of being whose power act not only as organizers of narrative but also as significations of a kind of feminine sensory apprehension of temporality. This discursive implementation of the moment as the center of modernist women writers' short fiction may be recuperated so as to preserve their achievements from the preference for a decentered écriture féminine.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113423<br>

Author(s): van Alphen Ernst<br>
Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: La critique phénoménologique de la métaphysique a opposé « l'intuition » à la « représentation », et le débat philosophique contemporain une phénoménologie « minimaliste » à une phénoménologie « maximaliste ». Face à ces alternatives, l'approfondissement weilien de l'expérience n'oppose ni la présence et l'absence, ni le fini et l'absolu, mais cherche à éprouver et penser le lien qui les unit, à partir de la structure trinitaire du don de l'être. À distance d'une médiation extériorisante comme d'une immanence pure, le processus de révélation n'est jamais négateur du mystère, mais en manifeste au contraire la profondeur. Ainsi, depuis la perception jusqu'à l'amour surnaturel, « évidence » et « mystère » vont toujours de pair, ce qui permet de ne rejeter aucun des niveaux de l'être et de l'expérience. The phenomenological critique of metaphysics opposed intuition and representation as contemporary debates in philosophy opposed minimalist and maximalist phenomenologies. Confronted with these alternatives the Weilean thought of experience neither opposes presence and absence, nor finite and absolute, but it tries to verify and think what unites them - based on the Trinitarian structure of the giving of being. Standing apart from exteriorizing mediation as from pure immanence, the revelation process never makes ineffective the mystery but expresses its depth. Thus, from perception to supernatural love, 'obviousness' and 'mystery' go together, which allows not to reject any levels of being and experience.<br>

Abstract: This contribution looks at the issue of how to present history by taking a look at one of the most cited countries for exemplifying a multicultural society. The author adopts a careful, even critical, stance when it comes to the pluralistic discourse and illustrates how, in the case of Canada, the problem of deciding whether to opt for a blanket discourse (a one-sided view of a country, stretching from one ocean to the next) or an atomising approach (allowing for as many historical interpretations as there are views) does not arise. The focus is more on establishing a factual as well as narrative discourse which allows for a representation of Canada in all its dissonances, changing equilibria, and stormy interdependence.The term "canadianité" would seem fitting, since it refers to the essence of how Canada has formed an historical identity. It could promote a way of relating history which offers an escape from the ostensibly dead-end situations found in the great narratives of Canada which are currently dominating our collective imaginations. Der Autor dieses Aufsatzes geht auf die Frage der Geschichtsschreibung in einem der als Beispiel für eine multikulturelle Gesellschaft meist zitierten Staaten ein. Er nimmt eine behutsame, ja kritische Position gegenüber dem pluralistischen Diskurs ein und zeigt auf, dass im Falle Kanadas das Dilemma nicht in der Entscheidung für einen unitaristischen Diskurs (einheitliche Sicht des Landes von einem Ozean zum anderen) oder einen atomisierenden (so viele Geschichten des Landes wie Sichtweisen) besteht. Vielmehr geht es darum, eine histori(ographi) sche Artikulationsebene faktischer und narrativer Art zu finden, die die Konzeptualisierung und Repräsentation Kanadas in all seinen Dissonanzen, wechselnden Gleichgewichten, stürmischen Interdependenzen ermöglicht. Hierzu könnte der Begriff der „ canadianité" beitragen, der auf den Kern der historischen Identitätsbildung Kanadas verweist. Er könnte Träger einer Geschichtserzählung sei~<br>

Abstract: The author of the article in question reports on a study analysing how 15 year-old French lycée pupils interpret school texts about the representation of the Norman kings of Sicily in the 12th century, the latter of whom allowed themselves to be portrayed both as Byzantine emperors and as Muslim caliphs. Ever since Moscovic's theory of social representation, we know that people make sense of specialized knowledge (in this case, historical knowledge) by converting it into "naïve", everyday knowledge. As pupils generally cannot explain the political intentions of the kings of Sicily, the lycée pupils were asked – as part of the study – to deal with the assertions of a paper (written by another pupil) that compared the Norman kingdom of Sicily and the situation of Maghrebine immigrants in presentday France. The study takes a closer look at how the learners, in the course of the "spiral-shaped" learning process, first acquired a "naïve" picture of the kings of Sicily, only later to distance themselves from their original thoughts in order to be able to make sense of their school texts. Der Autor des vorliegenden Artikels berichtet über eine Untersuchung, die analysiert, wie 15-jährige französische Gymnasiasten Schulmaterialen über die Repräsentationen der normannischen Könige von Sizilien im 12. Jahrhundert interpretieren. Letztere ließen sich sowohl als byzantinische Kaiser wie auch als muslimische Kalifen darstellen. Seit Moscovicis Theorie der sozialen Repräsentationen wissen wir, dass Menschen Fachwissen (hier historischem Wissen) einen Sinn geben, indem sie es in ein „naives" Alltagswissen verwandeln. Da Schüler im Allgemeinen die politischen Intentionen der Könige von Sizilien nicht erklären können, wurden im Rahmen dieser Untersuchung Gymnasiasten aufgefordert, sich mit einer schriftlichen Schülerarbeit zu befassen, die das normannische Königreich von Sizilien und die Situation maghrebinischer Einwanderer im heutigen Frankreich vergleicht. Es wurde näher betracht~<br>

Abstract: L'article identifie une tension dans la représentation hayékienne des règles de droit. Alors qu'elles jouent une fonction essentielle dans la coordination au sein de l'ordre spontané en définissant les attentes légitimes des agents, Hayek ne développe pas réellement les mécanismes par lesquels émerge une interprétation partagée des règles. D'abord, les fonctions des règles de droit au sein de l'ordre spontané sont présentées. Puis nous montrons que les règles sont constituées par les attentes que les agents forment à leur propos. Enfin, nous montrons qu'aucun des deux mécanismes proposés par Hayek -le sens de la justice et le juge -n'est capable de garantir la résolution des conflits d'interprétation entre les individus. De tels conflits mettent en question l'efficacité et la justice de l'ordre spontané. The article focuses on a tension in the Hayekian representation of legal rules. While rules perform an essential function of coordination by providing common interpretation about the legitimate expectations, Hayek does not really develop the mechanisms by which common interpretations may emerge. Firstly, the functions of coordination of rules are presented. We show then that rules are constituted by individual meanings. Finally we show none of the two mechanisms producing shared interpretations, the sense of justice and the judge, is able to guarantee the resolution of conflicts of interpretation between individuals. Such a conflict questions therefore spontaneous order's efficiency and justice.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the complicated workings of Japan's mnemonic praxis in its establishment of moral authority. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima was a decisive moment inaugurating Japan as the torch-bearer of pacifism. Given Japan's ideational multiplicity as the victim and the victimizer, its pacifist ideology needs further examinations in conceptual and empirical manifestations. This research situates the ambivalent amnesia and political compromises demonstrated during the renovation project of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum from 1985 until 1994. As for a nation yet to achieve meaningful reconciliation over the past with Asian neighbors, the political divide opens room for utilitarian considerations in its pacifist discourse. The Hiroshima experience suggests that Japan's pacifism can be a problematic representation given its selective mnemonic praxis and situational ethics. This paper argues that Japanese pacifism should be redefined as 'pacifist movement.' Pacifism is foundational ethics, whereas pacifist movement accommodates political contextualization.<br>

Abstract: The persecution, flight and murder of European Jews in the first half of the twentieth century and the profound social and political transformations that decisively affected European cities in the final decade of the 20th century have radically altered urban 'Jewish landscapes'. New stakeholders and institutions emerged with their own networks, goals and interests, and have constructed, staged and marketed 'Jewish culture' anew. The resultant Jewish spaces are being constituted in an urban space located at the intersection of ethnic representation, collective memory, and drawing on an imagined material culture, which includes architectural, physical and digital spaces (e.g. synagogues, Jewish quarters). This Europe-wide process is closely related to the delicate politics of memory and to discourses on the authenticity of cities. This article analyses how the image of 'Jewishness' plays an increasingly important role in the marketing of historical authenticity that cities and their tourism affiliates are undertaking.<br>

Abstract: Laying down as a theorical narratologic principle that history has never taken the shape of an actual experience, but was untili today a mere narrative representation, the author aims at following the evolution of the relation between literary shapes and historical past in the Polish literature after the Second World War. From 1945 onwards history does not appear any more as a kind of strategical staging; instead it becomes an attempt to live an immediate experience regardless of any intellectual reconstruction. Otherwise, instrumentalisation and ideological recovery of the past lead the Polish writers to a real denial of history thanks to (self) parodical literary forms. Finally the multiplication of autobiographical works means a new attack against the traditional historical novel. Thus, thanks to this triple strategy which leads to a dismantling of history consistent with the now prevailing bursting of narrative forms, Polish literature brings its own answer to the history crisis which is to be seen nowadays in the western literature.<br>

Abstract: H. P. Lovecraft's texts deal with the cosmos providing words and mechanisms beyond words, such as analogy. Tracing the relationship between analogy and the poetic metaphor in the Lovecraftian text the paper turns to Paul Ricoeur's notion of the living metaphor as the embodiment of tension providing secondary referentiality. The essay argues that the ontological nature of analogy and metaphor supplies an indirect strategy to move towards the beyond, to transfer the unknown to the realm of the known. In this process, by referring to what is interstitial, void-like, and monstrous, this metaphorically active, poetic, and "ecstatic" Lovecraftian text becomes a "monster" in its own right: the indescribable and unnamable overflow into the world of representation, creating the monster-text.<br>

Abstract: A metafísica aristotélica não considera o ser enquanto ser em si mesmo, mas enquanto símbolo daquilo que é simultaneamente o mais universal e o mais singular para o espírito. Platão antecipou a concepção propondo uma dialéctica ascendente, completada por uma dialéctica descendente, cuja dinâmica fora objecto de pesquisa nas suas últimas obras. A metafísica encontra-se na intersecção destas duas dialécticas, no eixo em que a primeira passa na outra. Este eixo começa a fazer sentido a partir do saber que o pensamento tem de si mesmo. A mentalidade representativa, desatenta à especificidade deste eixo, não consegue aceder à dimensão dos caminhos da razão. O eixo no coração das dialécticas clássicas é assumido pela metafísica contemporânea em termos de tempo associado com o espírito vivo em detrimento do ser conceptual. Aristotelian metaphysics does not consider being qua being in itself, but rather as a symbol of what is, for the spirit, at once the most universal and the most particular. Plato had anticipated the conception, the dynamic of which had been the object of investigation in his last works. Metaphysics finds itself at the intersection of these two dialectics, at the axis around which the first passes into the other. The axis takes its sense from the knowledge that thought has of itself. The mentality, based on representation, inattentive to the specificity of this axis, does not have access to the amplitude of the paths that reason can take. The axis at the heart of classic dialectics is taken up by contemporary metaphysics in terms of time associated with the living spirit rather than as conceptual being.<br>

Abstract: Conspiracy accounting is often regarded as an atypical, pathological form of political reasoning, and little research has considered how ordinary social actors may refer to political conspiracies in the course of argument. In this article, we consider the spontaneous use of conspiracy narratives by politically engaged Greek citizens in interview discussions of the Macedonian crisis. Analysis revealed that conspiracy narratives were typically used to challenge dominant representations that attributed the Macedonian crisis to Greek xenophobic nationalism. Specifically, conspiracy accounts were used to dispute assumptions concerning Greece's majority status by representing the political opposition as a consortium rather than a single out-group, by recasting the threat posed to Greece as a matter of realistic rather than symbolic competition, and by extending the historical frame of reference to encompass past and prospective future threats to the Greek people and the Greek state. In conclusion, we note how the use of conspiratorial reasoning may be used to construct complex causal arguments concerning intergroup relations and to challenge dominant ideological assumptions about social hierarchy and political legitimacy. In this respect, conspiratorial reasoning might be regarded as a prototypical form of intergroup representation.<br>

Abstract: A partir de una visión de la moneda que toma en cuenta su función simbólica primera —la de la representación de la totalidad social—, este artículo analiza la relación entre legitimidad política y el régimen monetario, puesta en escena por el paso de las altas inflaciones a la deflación en América Latina. En esta perspectiva se reconsideran los problemas de sustentabilidad de las políticas monetarias, y se establece que las mismas plantean más en América Latina que en Europa, el problema de la relación entre las soberanías política y monetaria. La interrogación se remite así al futuro posible del Mercosur: ¿se enredará en la discusión comercial o será motivo de emprender una deliberación política sobre la reorganización territorial y el marco institucional que sostendrían un crecimiento en economía abierta impulsado por el empleo y la demanda? On the basis of a view of currency that considers its initial symbolic function— that of the representation of social totality— the text analyzes the relationship between political legitimacy and monetary regime, caused by the shift from high inflation to deflation in Latin America. The problems of the sustainability of monetary policies are considered from this point of view, and the author suggests that, even more so in Latin America than in Europe, these policies raise the problem of the relationship between political and monetary sovereignty. The question leads one to the possible future of Mercosur: will it become enmeshed in trade discussions or will it lead to a political discussion on territorial reorganization and the institutional framework that would support growth in an open economy driven by employment and demand? À partir d'une vision de la monnaie qui prend en compte sa fonction symbolique première celle de la représentation de la totalité sociale, on analyse dans ce texte la relation entre légitimité politique et régime monétaire, relation mise en scène par le passage, en Amérique latine, de l'inflation galopan~<br>

Abstract: What makes the figure of the passenger distinctive as both a subject and an object of mobility and transportation systems? What distinguishes the passenger from other mobile subjectivities, from nomad, flaneur to consumer? How is the passenger represented, practiced and performed? How has the passenger and their experiences been conceived, imagined, manipulated, regulated and engineered? And what kind of human-technology assemblages do passengers enact? Through four short perspectives, this paper seeks to 'profile' the passenger as a distinctive historical and conceptual figure that can help to add greater precision to the analysis of our mobile ways of life. The passenger is explored as an object of speculative theoretical debate, a figure entangled in a host of identities, practices, performances and contexts, and an important way to illuminate key conceptual problematics, from representation to embodiment.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I set out a phenomenology of social transformation, based on an analysis of the distinctively religious form of communication which underlies the trans-generational and trans-cultural transmission of world traditions, taking Confucianism and Christianity as their representatives. A phenomenological analysis of their communicative structure allows the possibility of a better understanding of what can be learnt from them in the context of contemporary debates in both China and the West on the relations between religion, ethics and politics. This analysis suggests that the ethical consistency of belief and act, which is the necessary condition for the engendering of long-term solidarity in religious community, has significant implications for ethics in politics, and especially for the legitimacy of representational leadership as a focal point for change in society. The paper concludes that the historical experience of world religions can offer new insights into the nature of political leadership and representation in today's globalised world and that the appropriate locus for this inquiry is the present negotiation and re-negotiation of relations between China and the West.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i222390<br>
Date: 8 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Moore Susan<br>
Abstract: Critics have associated Conrad's fiction, above all, with a masculinist tradition of writers and philosophers, neglecting his engagement with popular forms of women's writing. Yet in his later work he aimed to reach a female readership of popular novels. This essay explores Conrad's encounter with the female sensation novel, pioneered by such authors as Mary Elizabeth Braddon. Focusing on Conrad's final, posthumously published novel Suspense, the discussion outlines his sensitive response to the narratological structures of the genre, especially Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret. In Suspense, Conrad draws on Braddon's problematic representation of female identity. His reference to the physical enclosure of the heroine, her potential madness, the suggestion of an incest plot, sexual ambivalence, and the presentation of the heroine as a visionary painting all allude to the earlier form. Furthermore, an examination of the serialization of Suspense in the women's pages of Hutchinson's Magazine shows the extent to which Conrad was indebted to sensationalism while also questioning its conventions.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Author(s): Woolard Webb<br>
Abstract: Sumbanese descriptions of the "traditional house" as a microcosm and emblem of local identity are neither unproblematic expressions of a cultural totality nor simply objectifications imposed by ethnography or modernity. One way the house is able to serve as a discursive object reflects, in part, specifically Sumbanese models of action and beliefs about language as refracted in changing historical circumstances. In ritual, speakers seek to engage and elicit responses from powerful others, whereas current religious and political developments reframe ritual words as means of describing a cultural world. Both sets of practices draw on the authority of "entextualized" language but interpret it in different ways. Emerging representations of cultural meaning are shaped by long-standing speech genres and by recent social and cultural transformations, mediated by shifting language ideologies.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226398<br>
Date: 11 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Zambouke Charles<br>
Abstract: In this study of Greek dreams at moments of illness and anxiety I explore the relationship between individual experience and cultural representation. Ethnographic data and textual sources show that the image of fields recurs in dreams, thus throwing into question the uniqueness of personal experience as well as the concept of "experience" as something separate from cultural narratives. Yet these same images might also be independently generated "from below" by the emotional, physical experience of distress and illness. This case points to the convergence of cultural and personal symbols and to their fusion in the moment of experience. Approaches from psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and folklore studies all provide possible theorizations. None of these options excludes the others. The image of the field in dreams is overdetermined precisely because the historicocultural, the cognitive, the psychobiological, and the social all simultaneously figure in human experience.

Abstract: To date, little is known about when and to what degree science students begin to participate in authentic scientific graphing practices. This article presents the results of a series of studies on the production, transformation, and interpretation of graphical representation from Grade 8 to professional scientific practice both in formal testing situations (inside) and in the course of field/laboratory work (outside). The results of these studies can be grouped into two major areas. First, there is a discontinuity in the graph-related practices that marks a boundary between people who engage in work that requires them to transform data into graphical representations (converted) and people who do not have such experiences (cannibals). Second, the didactic practices of high school textbooks and university lectures exhibit a marked discontinuity relative to graphing practices in scientific journals. Graphs used in didactic circumstances may be associated with students' difficulties in interpreting "real data." It appears that school teachers and university professors (missionaries) do little to put their students on trajectories of increasing participation in authentic scientific graphing practices.<br>

Abstract: Graph-related practices are central to scientific endeavors, and graphing has long been hailed as one of the core "general process skills" that set scientists apart. We use two case studies from a large study among scientists to exemplify our findings that graphing is not a context-independent skill. Rather, scientists' competencies with respect to graph interpretation are highly contextual and are a function of their familiarity with the phenomena to which the graph pertains. If graphing practices are not general but are tied to embodied understandings and familiarity with representation practices, then there are implications for teaching graphing in school mathematics and science settings.<br>

Abstract: This article treats Mexican
         retablos(devotional paintings) in relation to people's actions. Retablos serve as a basis for seeing, talking about, and interpreting events born from oppressive, modern conditions. Actions and artful representation indicate, respectively, proximity to reality, from near to far—a difference that outlines a space for aesthetic production. I argue that retablos contribute to an aesthetic that orients the senses and the mind against oppressive conditions and toward a positive vision of what the world might be.<br>

Abstract: Since the push for “authentic” literary culture and autonomous literary production must above all be read in national terms, it is useful to recall Rama's assertion that from the 1700s to the present, the slogan of Latin American writers has been “Be independent!” Calls have been made for ethnic, geographic, cultural, and local literary forms free of European elements. Rama identifies three main impulses that have driven literary innovation—independence, originality, and representation—and traces these aesthetic values to the romantic perception of America as “glaringly different from its mother societies, given its distinctive physical environment, its diverse ethnic makeup, and its difference in terms of development when compared to the only model of progress—Europe.”
         
               For the poetry of the Americas to be original, it simply must be true to its own particularity—or so it would seem.62<br>

Abstract: In the SPEP volume published in 1983 and made up of selected papers from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth meetings, the editors, William McBride and Calvin Schrag, commented on the “radicality, openness, passion for dialogue, freedom, and interest in pluralism” that the included papers made apparent. The year 1984 marked a significant turning point especially for the organization. The Committee on the Status of Women formed with the purpose of increasing the participation of women in SPEP. In 1981 six women participated in the program, three of them as moderators. In 1982 four women participated, one as moderator, and Joan Stambaugh gave an invited paper at the Nietzsche Society. In 1983 nine women participated, and two others gave papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. In 1984, five women participated, with one moderator among them, and there were three women giving papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. Then, after the founding of the Committee on the Status of Women in 1984, the program in 1985 had sixteen women on the program inclusive of two moderators, a keynote address by Julia Kristeva, and a book session on Ofelia Shutte's book
         Beyond Nihilism. One woman gave a paper at the Nietzsche Society. In that year Arleen Dallery became the first woman elected to SPEP's Executive Committee. The voting members at the twenty-fifth SPEP conference in 1986 selected Professor Dallery as the first woman co-director of SPEP, and twenty-four women were on the program, with four moderators. A panel discussed Linda Nicholson's bookGender and History, and Joan Stambaugh gave the paper “The Future of Continental Philosophy” in a plenary session symposium. Also in that year, at a tumultuous business session, the membership agreed that the Executive Committee would provide annually statistics on the number of papers by women that were submitted and that were accepted.

Abstract: Two of Marion's contributions to the phenomenology of religion are of special interest to us here. The first is the distinction between an idol and an icon.
            
                  We are talking about any physical representation of the divine. But the difference is not between the modes of representation but between the modes of intending the picture, statue, or a symbolic object such as a cross. If our gaze comes to rest on the representation as if the represented were fully presented to us in the representation, transcendence is lost. There is an identity of thought and being here in which our thought perfectly mirrors the object but at the same time the object becomes merely a mirror of our mind's content or capacity. This is an idol. If, on the other hand, my gaze “transpierces” both itself and its noematic object, recognizing the nonadequation of thought and being, the mind and its referent, we have an icon, a religious representation that is given as a reminder of the incomprehensibility of the sacred. The same analysis can be applied to concepts as well as to visibles. Hence Marion's interest in the apophatic traditions sometimes referred to as negative theology.34<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: A good model for envisioning how a hermeneutic phenomenology would engage Deleuze can be developed by drawing from resources established elsewhere in Ricoeur's thought. What I have in mind, specifically, is his reading of Freud in the book
         Freud and Philosophy.
               There Ricoeur reads Freud's work as “a mixed or even ambiguous discourse, which at times states conflicts of force subject to an energetics, at times relations of meaning subject to a hermeneutics.”22
            
               Freud's energetics, on the one hand, offers a naturalistic account of desire in which it is understood in terms of a cathexis—the placement and displacement of energy. And yet, psychoanalysis continually points back to the work of interpretation in which the psychoanalyst is dealing with conscious representations. The coexistence of these two discourses gives rise to an aporia, which Ricoeur formulates in the following way: “What is the status of representation or ideas in relation to the notions of instinct, aim of instinct and affect? How can an interpretation of meaning through meaning be integrated with an economics of cathexis, withdrawal of cathexis, anticathexis?”23
            
               To solve this aporia, Ricoeur goes on to show that these two discourses in Freud's work are not actually opposed. Instead, as he puts it, “the energetics implies a hermeneutics and the hermeneutics discloses an energetics.”24

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: There are several contemporary theorists who explore and offer significant insight into hyperbole, but they do not fully identify its specific rhetorical functions. They each offer important characteristics of hyperbole but do not demarcate both its global purpose and its figural limits. In this article, I have outlined two specific functions of hyperbole, and I have shown how they operate within discourse. I have also identified the metafunction of hyperbole and revealed that it may operate as a figure of thought beyond its traditional tropological limits. I have not abandoned these limitations but expanded on them by grounding hyperbole as a mode of thought within its specific stylistic formations. As such, hyperbole can be used to delve into the complexities and paradoxes of ethics and theo-philosophical argumentation—the intricacies of negative theology and ascetical theology, the problematic role of subjectivity, and the difficulty of representation. It can also be used discursively to read various philosophical texts—those of Friedrich Nietzsche, Slavoj Zizek, Søren Kierkegaard, Emmanuel Levinas, and Michel Foucault, for example—in ways other than they are typically read or to explicate concepts such as the “event,” the “spectacular,”
         jouissance, alterity, the real, anddifférance.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: The concept of public memory has brought with it the idea that human agency permeates the entire process of historical interpretation, representation, and appropriation. For good or ill, the emergence of memory as an analytical category has extended the right to participate in this process of representation beyond the professional historian. As Carl Becker presciently noted in a 1932 American Historical Society address, every person has become a historian. Agents contributing to the process of public memory include historical personages (e.g., George Washington, Harriet Tubman, or your suffragist great-great-grandmother), the contemporaries that produced and preserved their historical records, historians who fix and “objectify” the historical record, teachers who use historical texts in their classrooms, politicians and activists who advocate for inclusion of certain versions of history, community leaders who critique faulty historical representations, children who learn and read about individuals from long ago, and many more. Each of these agents contributes to the process of public memory creation and circulation in a different way, sometimes performing various roles simultaneously. It is clear that these many agents are related through their involvement in this process. But how, precisely, are they connected? I have suggested that the agential spiral may help us begin to answer that question.<br>

Abstract: The volume's next two essays address issues of physiology and representation, albeit in very different ways. In “The Playwright's Perplexity: Constitution, Contagion, and Consumption in
      The Doctor's Dilemma,” Alexis Soloski traces Shaw's ambivalence toward the figure of the stage consumptive. Through Louis Dubedat, she argues, the play “somewhat in spite of itself” endorses the “conventional, sentimental narrative of the typical fictional tubercular” even as it “succeeds as a satire of medics and morals.” Sonya Freeman Loftis's “The Superman on the Spectrum: Shaw's Autistic Characters and the Neurodiversity Movement” assesses the efficacy of the provocative appropriation of Shaw by a contemporary movement, anxious to reify a distinctive public identity and history while at the same time avoid reaffirming stereotypical perceptions and anachronistic spin-doctoring. Examining Saint Joan and Henry Higgins as characters on the spectrum, her essay seeks to illuminate what is interpretively at stake within the plays they inhabit and the extrapolative implications of readingthroughthose characters to produce an “Autistic Shaw.” (As a side note, surely underscoring the fecundity of Shaw studies, these two contributors each had a first child during the gestation of thisSHAWissue. The Life Force does not believe in mere coincidence.)<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: But the emphasis on failure as a product of design, or as a consequence of somehow having arrived at the wrong style, arguably forecloses on utopian possibility in architecture. As K. G. Bristol observes, adoption of the demolition of Pruitt-Igoe as representative of the failings of modern architecture, and as a marker of its demise, has at its core “the idea that architectural design was responsible for the demise of Pruitt-Igoe.”
         
               Hiding in this insight is a contribution to sharpening an understanding of just how Utopia might be alternatively construed in architecture, shedding light on how any understanding of Utopia that begins and ends with form (with design), with representation or spatial closure alone, really must be abandoned before Utopia can make a meaningful contribution to imagining architecture and the city in all their depth. As noted earlier, Harvey has conceptualized a first step in this direction in his development of “dialectical utopianism,” which turns on the necessity for “spatial closure” to be adjoined with the equal necessity of “social process” in the proposition of any Utopia that might take a concrete form.23<br>
