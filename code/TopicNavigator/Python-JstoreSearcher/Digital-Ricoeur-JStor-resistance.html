  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn9nx">Postcolonial Disorders</a><br>
  Author(s) Allden Kathleen<br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores the rise in political and religious vigilance in post–New Order Lombok, Indonesia, and the role that militias played in denying Soleh, a nationalist activist in Lombok, the social horizons (loosely, the nation and its youth) he once relied upon to define his political and, in the end, personal reality. The chapter provides an individual case study in order to examine how social disorder and political violence are experienced by a leading intellectual who has been deeply involved in Indonesian politics on the island of Lombok. It makes clear that resistance is at once a social and<br>

  Abstract: What has happened to “religion” in its present and increasingly public manifestation, propelled by global media, economic markets, and foreign policies as much as by resistance to them? How should we understand the worldwide tendencies toward the simultaneous homogenization
                  andpluralization of our social and cultural practices, that is to say, of our individual and shared forms and ways of life?

  Abstract: The very notion of seductive ethics is likely to give us pause, to seem more error than paradox. Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it. But the prescriptions of ethics are not always a matter of foreclosure;<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I focus on the motivations behind the current relationship between new media, play, and social identities in a framework of general, sociological categories. In particular, I intend to situate my analysis at the juncture between ludic culture, social control, and the social construction of the “ir-responsible” identity. The reason for this choice is that contemporary ludic culture can be quite well understood in light of the current imposition of social control and the mass resistance that is building against it.

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Violence-Postmodern war in Kosovo and Chechnya<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary Violence: Postmodern War in Kosovo and Chechnya draws on several years of field research, as well as interpretive IR theory and analysis of empirical source material so as to shed light on contemporary violence. Drawing on interpretive approaches to International Relations, the book argues that founding events and multiple contexts informed the narratives deployed by different members of each movement, illustrating why elements within the Kosovo Liberation Army and the armed forces of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria favoured regional and local strategies of war in the Balkans and the North Caucasus. The book draws on post-positivist analysis and empirical research so as unravel the relationship between narratives, stories and hermeneutic accounts of International Relations; regional politics and trans-local identity; globalisation and visual aspects of contemporary security; criminality and emotionality; which together illustrate the dynamics within the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and the North Caucasus and the road to war in 1999. The book is a major addition to a small field of genuinely readable studies of IR theory. The book will be of interest to academics, researchers, students, area studies experts and policy-makers seeking to understand the formation of the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Amongst other things, the book will be of interest to students and scholars of International Relations, Political Studies, Area Studies, as well as those within Cultural and Historical and Sociological Studies.<br>

  Abstract: The task of this chapter is to map the road to war in the Balkans and Caucasus. In order to do this the chapter is broken down into three constituent parts. Building on the last chapter, the analysis engages with localised social networks which informed the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Firstly we turn to the battle of Gudermes in Chechnya in 1998, and the incursion into Dagestan in 1999. This demonstrates how the former nationalist-separatist movement fragmented in a number of ways, becoming reconstituted around a broader anti-Russian regional narrative.

  Abstract: According to Marcus Borg, Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem was a counterdemonstration, as Pilate’s troops were also entering the city from the opposite direction to reinforce the garrison on the Temple Mount during Passover. Jesus’s entry, modeled on Zech 9:9–10, symbolized the peaceful kingdom of God. Peaceful, yes, but with active resistance through public criticism and symbolic acts. For, to our surprise, Jesus has recourse to violence in the temple! His pacifism must thus be qualified: it is “bifocal.” Toward the Roman occupation, its aspect is of nonresistance, but toward the temple personnel and the perversion of their mission, it<br>

  Abstract: In this book I have tried to elaborate the analogies and overlappings between Cavell’s philosophy and his religious perspective, either expressed philosophically or theologically. If such an undertaking might be deemed risky, it is because of Cavell’s own repeated resistance toward certain Christian depictions of the human state as helpless, fixed, awaiting supernatural aid, pursuing untimely theologizing, and the like. This resistance has been emphasized by his commentators and has often been taken as Cavell’s prevalent attitude. Especially in chapter 1 but also in the subsequent chapters, I have tried to oppose such interpretations—not because they are wrong (indeed,<br>

  Author(s) Bordo Susan<br>
  Abstract: There has traditionally been a strong resistance on the part of feminists to any recourse to the question of nature. Within feminist scholarship and politics, nature has been regarded primarily as a kind of obstacle against which we need to struggle, as that which remains inert, given, unchanging, and resistant to historical, social, and cultural transformations.¹ The suspicion with which biological accounts of human and social life are treated by feminists, especially feminists not trained in the biological sciences, is to some extent understandable. “Biology” not only designates the

Descartes’s most enduring achievement was to saddle subsequent Western thought with the idea that the world contains two radically different kinds of thing – material objects and minds – which are known to us in radically different ways. The material world, the world of trees and mountains, stone and water, is accessible in common to numerous observers. The<br>

  Abstract: This book is organized around the belief that cultural assumptions, principles, and aspirations have played a much larger role in international politics than is often conceded. In the American academy as well as the public arena, there has until fairly recently been considerable skepticism about, if not resistance to, such an idea. Not that anyone has considered international affairs immune to the influence of ideologies, values, or even symbols, but only that the conventional orthodoxy in international relations has tended either to downplay the effects of such factors or, more likely, to presume that the best way of understanding their<br>

  Abstract: To his critics, Bourdieu’s understanding of human agency (upon which I have relied to loosely structure my explanation of the abandonment) amounts to nothing more than a sophisticated version of social determinism.¹ Although Bourdieu’s intention had been to articulate a way of thinking about why people do what they do that transcended the reductive binaries of domination and resistance, his critics have consistently accused him of proposing a model of agency that condemns human actors to the reproduction of their own histories. And it is easy to see upon what logical grounds such accusations rest. For Bourdieu, after all, social<br>

  Abstract: Do people who profess the Christian faith have the right and perhaps the duty to resist the constituted authorities? What would be legitimate means for a necessary resistance, and what would not? These questions will guide us in this chapter in our examination of Luther’s theology. We selected the main passages from the writings of the Reformer around the Peasants’ War. Still, to deduce Luther’s theology on the question of resistance to authorities only from these writings (a period of a few months) gives only a partial and thus, distorted picture. Therefore, one must take into account Luther’s positions in<br>

  Author(s) Carlton Sue<br>
  Abstract: In social reality, the processes of fetishisation and de-fetishisation (resistance and struggle) are composed of multiple discourses that legitimise, strengthen and configure them with the break from domination. The constitution of social reality is constantly being transformed, due to conflict, tensions and shifts between power(s) and counter-power(s). However, after more than five centuries of imperial, colonial and capitalist domination and exploitation, we observe that the political asymmetry, economic inequality and ethno-racial injustice have become more acute in peripheral societies.

  Abstract: One day someone will look back at the last few de cades of U.S. literary criticism and remark on the strange trajectory of the category of the “universal.” Beginning with the reaction against structuralism, that person will observe a strong conceptual and rhetorical preference for multiplicity, diversity, and smallness across the major categories of the field. Among the many examples of this trend we can include the antagonism toward “grand narratives,” the postcolonial emphasis on hybridity, the resistance to Marxist models of totality (synonymous, briefly, with totalization) or to masculine models of desire seen in French feminism and queer theory<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Book Title: Body or the Soul?-Religion and Culture in a Quebec Parish, 1736-1901<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

  Abstract: Calixthe Beyala and Gisèle Pineau explore further the concept of “geographies of pain” by depicting intimate space, language, and the body as sites of pain, exile, and resistance to violence.¹ In the tradition of women’s literature, the two writers turn their attention to internal sources of violence and, through their characters, condemn those who still focus solely on the external factors of violence. They ask questions such as: How can women successfully re-territorialize their violated bodies within the intimate spaces from which they have been exiled? How can they overcome linguistic limitations in expressing pain? Beyala sees linguistic violence as<br>

  Abstract: This volume pursues critical readings of the Bible that put psychoanalysis into conversation with Marxist and postcolonial criticism. In these essays psychoanalysis provides a way to mediate between Marxism's materialist groundings and postcolonialism's resistance against empire. The essays in the volume illuminate the way empire has shaped the biblical text by looking at the biblical texts' silences, ruptures, oversights, over-emphases, and inexplicable elements. These details are read as symptoms of a set of oppressive material relations that shaped and continue to haunt the text in the ascendancy of the text in the name of the West.<br>

  Abstract: Two major discourses of change in the 1960s, student revolt and black consciousness, were introduced to South Africa primarily through, literature, music, and individual agency. The knowledge transfer helped to define and transform resistance to apartheid from liberal expressions and values to ideologically informed New Left activism. The impact of this shift and the forms it took had highly significant long term outcomes for South Africa, but the perception of South Africa as an isolated place disconnected from early forms of globalization has become a self reflective trope and the significance of links with global changes are not recognized.<br>

There is another area of mental activity that we glimpse in what we recall of dreams, in slips of the tongue, and more dramatically in behavior under hypnosis. This area, the unconscious, resists being known or spoken; and to bring it to consciousness we encounter resistance or repugnance and feel a sense of exertion.¹ Because of its resistance to becoming conscious knowledge, the unconscious has a paradoxical nature.

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

Fiction and non-fiction stories by and about mothers—particularly the stories of poor women, working women, and women of colour—have gone largely unrecorded. What remains are patriarchal daughter-centred stories of young women who move from one male protector to another: father to husband to son.

  Abstract: What are the effects of radical oppression on the human psyche? What happens to the inner self of the powerless and traumatized victim, especially during times of widespread horror? In this bold and deeply penetrating book, Amos Goldberg addresses diary writing by Jews under Nazi persecution. Throughout Europe, in towns, villages, ghettos, forests, hideouts, concentration and labor camps, and even in extermination camps, Jews of all ages and of all cultural backgrounds described in writing what befell them. Goldberg claims that diary and memoir writing was perhaps the most important literary genre for Jews during World War II. Goldberg considers the act of writing in radical situations as he looks at diaries from little-known victims as well as from brilliant diarists such as Chaim Kaplan and Victor Klemperer. Goldberg contends that only against the background of powerlessness and inner destruction can Jewish responses and resistance during the Holocaust gain their proper meaning.<br>

  Abstract: A specific Jewish culture developed as a result of integration into the Islamic countries, and its originality, as well as its proximity to Islamic civilization, found expression in the architecture of the synagogue. When the Europeans arrived, however, they tended to impel the Jews, not without resistance, to build synagogues on stylistic and monumental models borrowed from European architecture. Thus, a strictly internal and hidden place of worship, in keeping with the tradition of an Israelite temple, was transformed into a symbol of emancipation and integration into modern society.

The different uses in the different settings and situations may sometimes represent resistance to and undermining of the center-ing force; they may also simply reflect in different ways the reality and power of the center. These differences are the stuff of ongoing social-cultural dynamics—differentiation, conflict, negotiation, formation, deformation, reformation.¹<br>

                  slaverywould eventually be abolished in the British Caribbean in 1833–34 and in the United States in 1865. The struggle to ban the trade in people of African origin and, by extension, their “thingification” (Césaire, 1950) was fought by many – by enslaved blacks and by white abolitionists – and it was fought in many different forms. Forms of resistance on the part of the enslaved ranged from survival tactics of fugitive slaves organizing in so-called maroon<br>

  Abstract: Édouard Glissant’s writing is deeply rooted in a strategy that challenges a hegemonic form of language use,¹ as described in detail by Celia Britton, with particular reference to his essays and novels (Britton, 1999). Miles Davis’s music, too, can be interpreted as a counter-discourse. The literature of the Caribbean and jazz music in the United States belong in fact to areas of cultural activity which have comparable histories despite their dissimilarities. A comparative approach to Glissant’s writing and the trumpet player’s improvisations can therefore allow us to reflect on the connections between strategies of resistance and, on the other hand,<br>

  Book Title: Artists, Intellectuals, and World War II-The Pontigny Encounters at Mount Holyoke College, 19421944<br>
  Publisher: University of Massachusetts Press<br>
  Author(s): Remmler Karen<br>
  Abstract: Sixty years ago, at the height of World War II, an extraordinary series of gatherings took place at Mount Holyoke College in western Massachusetts. During the summers of 1942–1944, leading Europeanﬁgures in the arts and sciences met at the college with their American counterparts for urgent conversations about the future of human civilization in a precarious world. Two Sorbonne professors, the distinguished medievalist Gustave Cohen and the existentialist philosopher Jean Wahl, organized these “Pontigny” sessions, named after an abbey in Burgundy where similar symposia had been held in the decades before the war. Among the participants—many of whom were Jewish or had Jewish backgrounds—were the philosophers Hannah Arendt and Rachel Bespaloff, the poets Marianne Moore and Wallace Stevens, the anthropologist Claude LéviStrauss and the linguist Roman Jakobson, and the painters Marc Chagall and Robert Motherwell. In this collection of original essays, Stanley Cavell and Jacques Derrida lead an international group of scholars—including Jed Perl, Mary Ann Caws, Jeffrey Mehlman, and Elisabeth YoungBruehl—in assessing the lasting impact and contemporary signiﬁcance of Pontignyen Amérique. Rachel Bespaloff, a tragicﬁgure who wrote a major work on the Iliad, is restored to her rightful place beside Arendt and Simone Weil. Anyone interested in the “intellectual resistance” of Francophone intellectuals and artists, and the inspiring support from such Americanﬁgures as Stevens and Moore, will want to read this pioneering work of scholarship and historical recreation.<br>

  Abstract: Pontigny-en-Amérique provided a space for French refugees to gather and continue their conversation about art, ideas, and politics in the dark time of World War II. Other refugees, particularly those lucky enough to escape from Nazi Germany, were equally eager to create spaces for exchanging ideas and forging resistance, even as they found themselves in constant flight. The dark times in Europe between 1933 and 1942 are the topic of Bertolt Brecht’s conversational play about the situation of two German refugees in Scandinavian exile.¹ Brecht’s play offers both a complementary account of similar “conversations in exile” as well as some<br>

  Abstract: Caribbean discourse and literature open a unique possibility for an innovative rereading of spatial and postcolonial theories in conjunction. The Caribbean has always been contested space, historically fought over and swapped among various colonial powers while conceptually cast as either the abyss of the slave plantation or the garden of worldly paradise. Engaging with various discursive representations of this ambiguity of Caribbean space, I address in this chapter the polarized visions of Caribbean postcoloniality between brutal colonial facts and powerful images of their contestation.

Yet, Nietzschean affirmation takes shape in the resistance to Schopenhauer’s conclusion that the denial of life is the ultimate human response to this condition and that such denial—exemplified in the saint—is definitive of holiness. Nietzsche did not share Schopenhauer’s estimation of the Christian saint, but he nevertheless remained fascinated with the way that the religious virtuoso used renunciation, intoxication, and<br>

  Abstract: The chapters on Dickens and Eliot move, in their respective ways, laterally and downward. They seek to convey the imaginative geography of each writer’s world—its norms of characterization, plot sequence, and setting—as well as to identify within each world, beneath the surface, a cluster of latent confusions. I attend to Dickens and Eliot in the measure that their work reveals an internal resistance to its own premises. Indeed, one formulation of Dickens’ more capacious achievement is that his work manages (as Eliot’s does not) to assimilate—by out-maneuvering, by disguising, by blinking—its own fissures.<br>

  Abstract: As mass media-communicated corporate public relations and product advertising form conditions for the distribution of product and corporate images, the transformation into a multimedia society and, in particular, the introduction and widespread appropriation of the Internet, enable the sociotechnical possibility of converting political protest in favor of anti-corporate campaigns using a consumerist repertoire. Appealing to citizens as “netizen consumers” creates new options for a politicization of market sphere-related activities.¹ Protest actors promoting consumer resistance use the Internet as a site of contestation: they use digital communication tools to deconstruct brand images and re-contextualize them against the backdrop of global justice.<br>

  Book Title: Conflicted Memories-Europeanizing Contemporary Histories<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Ramsbrock Annelie<br>
  Abstract: Despite the growing interest in general European history, the European dimension is surprisingly absent from the writing of contemporary history. In most countries, the historiography on the 20th century continues to be dominated by national perspectives. Although there is cross-national work on specific topics such as occupation or resistance, transnational conceptions and narratives of contemporary European history have yet to be worked out. This volume focuses on the development of a shared conception of recent European history that will be required as an underpinning for further economic and political integration so as to make lasting cooperation on the old continent possible. It tries to overcome the traditional national framing that ironically persists just at a time when organized efforts to transform Europe from an object of debate to an actual subject have some chance of succeeding in making it into a polity in its own right.<br>

  Abstract: This book explores alternative cultural encounters with and around information technologies. These encounters are alternative because they counter dominant, Western-oriented notions of media consumption; they include media practices as forms of cultural resistance and subversion, "DIY cultures," and other nonmainstream models of technology production. The contributors -- leading thinkers in science and technology studies, anthropology, and software design -- pay special attention to the specific inflections that different cultures and communities give to the value of knowledge. The richly detailed accounts presented here challenge the dominant view of knowledge as a neutral good -- information available for representation and encoding but separated from all social relations. The chapters examine specific cases in which the forms of knowledge and cross-cultural encounters are shaping technology use and development. They consider design, use, and reuse of technological tools, including databases, GPS devices, books, and computers, in locations that range from Australia and New Guinea to Germany and the United States.ContributorsPoline Bala, Alan Blackwell, Wade Chambers, Michael Christie, Hildegard Diemberger, Stephen Hugh-Jones, James Leach, Jerome Lewis, Dawn Nafus, Gregers Petersen, Marilyn Strathern, David Turnbull, Helen Verran, Laura Watts, Lee Wilson<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 18, ‘Here and Nowhere: Poststructuralism, Resistance and Utopia’, Sotiropoulos explores the thorny problem of a poststructuralist politics or, more particularly, a poststructuralist politics of resistance. By way of an illuminating and engaging cross-comparative analysis of Foucault, Deleuze and Derrida, Sotiropoulos argues that poststructuralism can itself be seen as an event of political resistance, that it works with and through various conceptions of utopia, mobilised as so many potential material movements immanent to becomings that are at play in the social and political world. However, this poststructuralist politics of resistance is not without limits, according to Sotiropoulos, as it<br>

  Author(s) Robson Mark<br>
  Abstract: The origins of this essay derive from the attempt to make sense of a certain resistance to Jacques Rancière’s work that I have encountered at film studies conferences in the United States. As I see it, this resistance can be traced to what is seen as a tension or contradiction between Rancière as the self-proclaimed amateur advocating for universal equality on the one hand, and what are perceived as the trappings of cultural distinction that mark his writings on cinema on the other – specifically the familiar auteurist pantheon that makes up the films he focuses on and, perhaps more significantly,<br>

  Abstract: In advocating a change of direction for research on youth, Angela McRobbie (1994: 186) asks ‘what are the discourses within which “different, youthful, subjectivities” are constructed? How are they expressed?’ In exploring language, power and young people, this chapter maps some of the discursive constructions of self that articulate youth identities in everyday modern life. It examines the ways in which language is taken up and used as resistance to mainstream norms and values. It looks at the sorts of discourse practices drawn upon to constitute, shape and signal membership of particular youth cultures. And, as contemporary social change demands<br>

  Book Title: Narratives of Agency-Self-Making in China, India, and Japan<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Dissanayake Wimal<br>
  Abstract: This multidisciplinary collection underlines the importance of understanding the operations of human agency-defined here as the ability to exert power, specifically in resistance to ideological pressure. In particular, the contributors emphasize the historical and cultural conditions that facilitate the production of agency in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures of China, India, and Japan. In Narratives of Agency, scholars from a variety of disciplines argue that traditional Western approaches to the study of these cultures have unduly focused on the pervasive influence of family and clan (China), caste and fatalism (India), and groupism (Japan). This tendency has been exacerbated by modern critical approaches, such as postmodernism and poststructuralism, that not only are increasingly popular in studying these cultures but also de-emphasize the role of the individual. The resultant undermining of the notion of human agency tends to give short shrift to the very real individual differences between groups and ignores questions of personal desire and intentionality. These essays remind us that members of a community have to make personal choices, struggle and interact with others, argue about positions, and confront new challenges, all of which involve intentionality and human agency. A new look at a topic central to cross-cultural understanding, Narratives of Agency will be essential reading for those interested in China, India, Japan, and the world beyond._x000B_ _x000B_Contributors: Richard G.

  Abstract: The method of rational reconstruction, at which Habermas arrived via two steps—ideology critique and philosophical anthropology—sets itself three tasks. First—and above all—it seeks to ground the normative standards for a critical theory of society (section 2). Second, it wants to demonstrate that social development from premodernity to modernity manifests an instance of progress—which it also intends to explain, at least in part (section 3). Finally, it tries to identify current potentials for resistance (section 4).

  Abstract: Established, commissioned, and edited by the Department of German at the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh German Yearbook encourages and disseminates lively and open discussion of themes pertinent to German Studies, viewed from all angles but with particular interest in problems arising out of politics and history. No other yearbook covers the entire field while addressing a focused theme in each issue. Coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, volume 3 re-directs current debates on memory and tradition, opening up fresh perspectives on the cultural history of the GDR and exploring how the nation's cultural discourses entered into a productive but often problematic dialogue with the values of the past and with the German cultural inheritance. Topics include the compositional engagement with musical heritage; industrial design and cultural politics; the establishment of antifascist monuments and their use as sites of resistance; constructions of a cultural heritage in architecture; the influence of cultural politics on literary scholarship; continuities and breaks with tradition in visual and literary culture; and engagement with the past in the works of Konrad Wolf, Irmtraud Morgner, and Anna Seghers.

  Book Title: Juan Goytisolo: The Author as Dissident-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): de Menezes Alison Ribeiro<br>
  Abstract: This monograph offers two new perspectives on Spanish writer, Juan Goytisolo. First, under the themes of authorship and dissidence, it integrates his writing across several genres, providing a rounded assessment of his contribution to cultural debates in Spain since the sixties and arguing that resistance to repressive discourses characterizes his essays and autobiographies as much as his fiction. Second, it revises the prevailing critical interpretation of Goytisolo's fiction by building on four premises: that his novels are less clearly oppositional than prevailing interpretations imply; that, in order to engage with discourses of identity, he employs an idiom which, contrary to his own statements, is not a poststructuralist autonomous world of words; that a textual practice grounded in the recognizable experience of post-Civil War Spain, rather than one which seeks out the realm of pure textuality, is essential to Goytisolo's subversive political intentions; and that the autobiographical element of much of his work constitutes a more complex narrative aesthetic than has been appreciated. The book argues that if Goytisolo's work is interpreted as an ethical engagement with postmodernist theory, rather than as an illustration of it, then certain contradictions for which he has been criticized are seen in a new and valuable light.

  Abstract: The processes which have been discussed in this book under the umbrella of the general term “hybridization” did not meet with everyone’s approval at the time, as the use of pejorative terms such as “mish-mash”, “hotchpotch” or “bastard” vividly suggest. In this brief coda, the attempt will be made to view them from a different perspective, not as solutions but as problems. The process of hybridization, it was suggested earlier, may be conscious or unconscious. On the other hand, opposition to the process is necessarily conscious, whether it takes the weaker form of resistance or the stronger form of a<br>

  Book Title: Transition in Post-Soviet Art-The Collective Actions Group Before and After 1989<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Groys Boris<br>
  Abstract: The artistic tradition that emerged as a form of cultural resistance in the 1970s changed during the transition from socialism to capitalism. This volume presents the evolution of the Moscow-based conceptual artist group called Collective Actions, proposing it as a case-study for understanding the transformations that took place in Eastern European art after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Esanu introduces Moscow Conceptualism by performing a close examination of the Collective Actions group’s ten-volume publication Journeys Outside the City and of the Dictionary of Moscow Conceptualism. He analyzes above all the evolution of Collective Actions through ten consecutive phases, discussing changes that occur in each new volume of the Journeys. Compares the part of the Journeys produced in the Soviet period with those volumes assembled after the dissolution of the USSR. The concept of “transition” and the activities of Soros Centers for Contemporary Art are also analyzed.<br>

  Abstract: The overall impact of transitology on Russian political and economic life cannot be compared with its effects in other postsocialist countries and republics of the former USSR. This country's former status as superpower and the suspicious attitudes of the "reformed" elites toward every foreign project or initiative, as well as the resistance to Westernization traditional for this culture are among many factors that have imposed limits both theoretical and practical (or policy-making) on the neoliberal paradigm of democratization and modernization. This is not to say, however, that Russian political elites or political scientists ignored or neglected the impact of the<br>

Abstract: Second, we would ask where he assumes it is
         appropriate to speakabout his interpretation. Does he assume that it is somehow his duty to talk about his interpretation of the news or that it is impolite to entertain that kind of conversation, or that talk does not matter? Finally, we would askwhat image of the wider world, and his relation to it, does he have in mind when offering his interpretation of the news? Studies of resistance (Hall1973; Morley1980; Scott1990; Lancaster1988; Willis 1981; Kelley1996) describe long‐standing communities resisting clear, structural domination: Working‐class listeners relating to mainstream news, peasants or slaves relating to official pronunciamentos, or African‐American or working‐class students relating to white, middle‐class teachers. But not all modes of interpreting dominant culture are only either “resisting” or “complying with” elites or powerful institutions; they do not just say “yes” or “no,” but articulate whole new meanings. Second, resistance studies show situations in which members actively perceive oppression as coming directly from an employer, schoolteacher, or political ruler who is immediately present or to whom members can speak directly. But our studies show situations in which the source of oppression is not very clear to members. Oppression may be coming from diffuse sources, in which there is no clearly embodied oppressor against whom to rebel (Hayward2000).<br>

Abstract: These historical texts about the origins of Dissent were merely the most visible forms of the ways in which memories of the Dissenting past were reproduced in the eighteenth century. Much was no doubt transmitted orally in family conversation. Memories were also held in material objects—in buildings, in gravestones and memorial plaques, in the family Bible and other books. Week after week of attendance at a chapel that traced its history back to the same historical moment, and that honored its ancestors and founders, reinforced a congregational identity rooted in narratives of persecution, of resistance to popery and arbitrary power, of unflinching commitment to religious and civil liberty. The weekly sermons of the minister were similarly important in the transmission of memory and of a self‐consciously historical identity. Funeral sermons in particular were opportunities for conjuring up the past, reconnecting to the heroic sufferings of a previous generation. Here the strong family roots of Dissent give history a powerful emotional charge. Genealogy and family lore intersected with the political history of the nation. Fathers and grandfathers and great‐grandfathers had suffered for the cause of truth and might even be there, honored, among the 2,000 victims listed by name in the two editions of the
      Abridgementor in theContinuation. Under the name Edmund Calamy on the title page was addedfils et nepos, son and grandson. And when Laurence Echard, in hisHistory of England, made some derogatory remarks on the Puritan preacher Edmund Calamy, his grandson—some eighty years after—declared that he counted it an honor to be descended from him.60Much of the biographical material in his histories had been sent to him by the family relations of ejected ministers so that these texts were, in some degree, a collective work of memory by the Dissenting community of the early eighteenth century. In numberless forms, the memory of the Restoration betrayal, of “the Great Ejec~<br>

Abstract: Without lingering over other processes of objectification (psychiatry, biology, etc.), let us consider directly the definition of the human being not only as social animal (social living being), but as political object, such as it ratifies and perfects the “mobilization” without remainder of the humanity of man.
         21The political determination of man is not summed up by his sociability, but, at the very least, politics imposes upon that sociability a technological treatment. In particular, through the determination of one's identity (of his name, I.D., passport) according to number: dates (from birth to death), places (residence, work, trips, etc.), health, commercial operations (bank account numbers, credit cards, etc.), local as well as long‐distance communications (sound and visual recordings, electronic addresses, cell phones, etc.), all become numbers, such that the identity thus “digitized” according to limitless parameters erects a comprehensive definition of the citizen. And inevitably this comprehensive definition ends up by authorizing, indeed demanding, the separation of men according to those who satisfy the political conditions of this citizenship and those who are excluded or ought to be (“exclusion,” beginning with the jobless, the homeless, the maladjusted, delinquents, and illegal immigrants, and ending with the mentally ill, or embryos reputedly not yet humanized, or supernumerary, etc.). From the identity card to the list of interdiction, the outcome, while not good, is nonetheless possible, easy, and rapid. Political wisdom consists first in resisting such an outcome. Failing such resistance, there will be no end of ideologies or racisms that produce definitions of man and, through an inverted outcome, proscribe those who do not fit in, before moving on to the arrest, or indeed to the extermination of the submen or nonmen thus identified.22<br>

Abstract: Ibid., pp. 14–16, Braudel emphasizes his exclusion from the elite, degree‐granting French universities and from directing graduate student theses, and he calls the Sixième Section of the Ecole “the miracle, for its creation hung by a thread in 1947.” Despite his 1949 appointment to the Collège de France, his 1949–54 tenure as chair of the history section of the national examination (
            aggrégation), or his positions in the Sixth Section of the Ecole or in the Maison, Braudel saw himself and his group as “heretics until almost 1968,” when “the troubles of May and June 1968 changed everything.” He compares his own marginalization outside the prestigious degree‐granting universities offering graduate student instruction in France with the exclusion by the Collège de France of Marc Bloch and Henri Berr.

Abstract: These tensions were interestingly played out in the twentieth century in the teaching of business and professional writing. The first attempts to teach business, professional, technical, and scientific people how to write were by and large undertaken by persons in those fields. The aims of this pedagogy were very close to those expressed by the originators of the memo form: to break with the old rhetoric and to fashion new genres of writing. Even as late as 1929, Philip McDonald complained in his
            English and Scienceabout the way in which English was taught in the schools, which he saw as promoting obscurity, pomposity, and ornateness.63But McDonald means to indict a rhetorical style. His conclusions favored the continued segregation of technical writing from English departments. Yet after the Second World War, business and technical writing came under the province of English and composition teachers, who were more disposed to favor the norm of clarity descending from belletrist culture than the norm of technicity regnant in the professions.64The technical fields put up little resistance to this transfer of teaching authority because they were themselves increasingly troubled by the tension between technicity and clarity.65<br>

Abstract: Following up on Francis Clooney’s insightful work on the comparative reading of religious texts,
         45I would like to suggest that we can best appreciate the cognitive power of comparison by looking at the comparative process in terms of contemporary theories of metaphor. Metaphor brings together two terms previously kept apart by established classificatory schemes.46The cognitive dissonance produced by the juxtaposition of categorically dissimilar terms calls forth from the interpreter an additional degree of cognitive effort.47By closing off the path of least cognitive resistance that is the literal meaning, metaphor forces us to give a new meaning to the words whereby the terms are reconciled to each other.<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: McNay’s
      Gender and Agency, while differing fromGender in the Mirrorin focus, shares in Meyers’s vexation with existing approaches to agency. McNay is particularly suspicious of theorists of cultural studies who “impute to certain everyday practices a kind of inherently subversive status” (4). She argues that the widely deployed idea of everyday resistance has no impact when the interplay between individual behavior and social norms is ignored: “This, in turn, indicates the necessity of contextualizing agencywithin power relationsin order to understand how acts deemed as resistant may transcend their immediate sphere in order to transform collective behavior and norms” (4, emphasis added). One can see that McNay is explicitly conscious of the tension that lurks in Meyers’s work, and the point is repeated throughout the book: “Analysis of the way in which certain subversive practices may get taken up and collectivized is important if resistance is to mean anything other than the truism that individuals do not reproduce social norms in a straightforward fashion” (129). Yet even more than Meyers’s, McNay’s argument glides from the language of mandate in her proposals (analogous to Meyers’s “musts”) to the language of possibility and potential in the results: a new theory of contextualized feminist agency could, may, might lead to collective action and greater freedom for women.<br>

Abstract: Let us now see how Haraway explains the first question raised above. Haraway sees the writings of women of color as postmodern resistance writing or cyborg writing. Like all colonized groups, women of color seize the power to write in order to resignify hegemonic Western myths: “The poetry and stories of US women of color are repeatedly about writing, about access to the power to signify; but this time that power must be neither phallic nor innocent. … Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other. … Figuratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of women of color” (Haraway
         1991, 175). Haraway’s claims for the writings of women of color are similar to the arguments of scholars who see minority writing or postcolonial writing as resistance writing alone. However, such an argument not only reifies the very binaries of center and margin, colonizer and colonized, that Haraway as poststructuralist wishes to blur but also homogenizes, through a colonial imperative, the margin itself, a tactic strongly critiqued by feminists like Chandra Talpade Mohanty (1991, 51). Let us revisit, for a moment, the two groups of texts Haraway compares: constructions of women of color and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction. One includes a variety of texts (presumably including autobiographies, novels, poetry, and drama) by a racially marked group, while the other deals with grotesque bodies in a specific genre. One would be hard‐pressed to find similar generalizations about white U.S. women’s writings, but women of color become fair game here, as did all third‐world texts in Fredric Jameson’s much contested claim about these texts being national allegories (1986).<br>

Abstract: See Homi K. Bhabha,
            Location of Culture(London and New York: Routledge, 1994). Following in Fanon’s footsteps, he provides a pertinent analysis of how the identity‐shaping recognitive process within the concrete historical conditions of colonialism and its postcolonial aftermath has worked to suppress the play of difference within each cultural identity. Part of the strategy of colonial rule and ideological justification for the European colonizers, he points out, was always to construct rules and standards of recognition around the notions of “modernity,” “rationality,” and “progress” and to produce a totalizing and hierarchically structured binary opposition between the colonizers and the colonized by recognizing the full presence of modernity and rationality in the former while assigning to the latter their complete absence or merely partial presence. The colonizing Europe accomplished this by disavowing the presence of heterogeneity within itself, such as the feminine and the irrational, and symbolically constructing and representing the colonized cultures as the essentialized Other of its now homogeneous rational self (and civilized, muscular Christianity)—e.g., the bestially sexual Africans, the duplicitous Chinese, and the effeminate and degenerate Hindus. But the artificial construction of such a binary opposition is inherently unstable, Bhabha argues, as can be seen for instance from the self‐contradictory nature of the colonizers’ attempt to convert the subject population to Christianity and to create a class of colonial elites educated in the ways of Europe, which was tantamount to an implicit recognition of the capacity of the colonized for rationality and self‐government, while at the same time deprecating and deriding that recognized presence of the “civilized” qualities in them as mere mimicry or even mockery of the authentic European, Christian identity. According to Bhabha, it is precisely the practice of mimicry on the part of the colon~<br>

Abstract: The inscription specifies that the list of names includes people who lost their lives as well as those who served prison sentences, were sent to labor camps, or were relocated. The names do not follow any obvious arrangement, alphabetical or otherwise, except that they are grouped under administrative regions. A quick perusal of names grouped under the city of Sofia reveals the presence of Bogdan Filov, who served as prime minister to Tsar Boris III between 1940 and 1943 and who became one of the regents to Simeon after the king's death. A well‐known archaeologist with strong pro‐German leanings, Filov brought the country onto the side of the Axis powers. Along with other members of the regency, he was sentenced to death and shot by the Communist‐dominated People's Court in 1945. Another name that stands out is that of the retired general Khristo Lukov, who was assassinated by a Communist cell (the urban counterpart of the partisan formations during the Second World War) on February 13, 1943. Lukov had been leader of the Legion, the pronounced racist, antisemitic, pro‐Nazi organization in Bulgaria. Even in these days of antiterrorist fetishism, eyebrows would be raised if a monument appeared in France, Italy, or Germany commemorating the “victims” of the antifascist resistance.<br>

Abstract: The result, methodologically, is that theological ethics not only learns a great deal from the empirical study of children’s contemporary lives but also uses the experiences of children to transform theological ethics’ own understanding of the kingdom of God. Liberationist childhood studies is thereby significantly patterned on Christian feminism, black theology, and other movements that start with experiences of social marginalization and move from there to a deepened interpretation of the Christian message. Such an approach is arguably closer than communitarianism to Jesus’s holding up childhood as a theological model of the kingdom of heaven. At the same time, however, it is not altogether clear how far childhood studies can in fact be patterned on feminist and other liberationist methods. Unlike other marginalized groups, children do not, as children, have sufficient capacities to enact their own grassroots liberation for themselves. They will never, for example, organize their own communities of resistance or hold university faculty positions in which to challenge ethical hegemonies. As vulnerable beings they may in fact rely, more than women and minorities, on substantive guidance and support from others. While liberationism does frequently call for children’s social and political protection, its bottom‐up methodology may ultimately leave unclear what
         uniqueform of responsibility children in particular demand from adults and society.<br>

Abstract: The foregoing is certainly not an exhaustive list of the elements of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship. No one person can pretend to suggest an all‐inclusive set of elements. The question to be faced is, How do we, as public professionals, address the need for a more comprehensive consideration of ethics? The answer to this question grows out of the rights‐based premises upon which this article is based. As a public profession, librarianship is committed to a democratic form of public polity. An essential part of the democratic way of being is deliberation, especially public deliberation. Among the many ways we can define democracy is by aggregative or deliberative means. An aggregative position assumes that collective preferences are given; that is, the preferences are taken to be legitimated so that no further justification is required. Invocation of the LBR or ALA’s Code of Ethics as immutable dogmas of the profession may be indicative of an aggregative definition of democracy. The principal shortcoming of this stance is that challenge of taken‐for‐granted preferences is very difficult and meets with tenacious resistance. An alternative—deliberative democracy—admits to pluralism of preferences and of participants. Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson maintain that “deliberation is generally the best way to arrive at just decision, or, more accurately, the least unsatisfactory” way [
         34, p. 41].<br>

The Christian paradigm exemplifies this further condition of possibility of responsibility. According to this new conception, responsibility requires a break with established or sanctified dogmas (including the most convincing and convinced
      doxa). Rather than seeking conformity, one may have to set oneself apart from what is publicly or commonly accepted. In other words, responsibility is tied here to heresy in all the senses of the term—particularly, as is the case with Patočka, to a “departure from a doctrine, difference within and difference from the officially and publicly stated doctrine and the institutional community that is governed by it” (GD,p. 26). Heresy is not only “an essential condition of responsibility,” it “also destines responsibility to the resistance or dissidence of a type of secrecy. It keeps responsibility apart … and in secret. And responsibilitydepends on[tient à] what is apart and secret” (GD,p. 26; trans. mod.). Indeed, if knowledge remains only on the threshold of a responsible decision, if a decision is a decision on the condition that it exceeds simple consciousness and simple theoretical determination, the responsible self must, in principle, be unable—that is, run the risk of not being able—to fully account for the singular act constitutive of a responsible decision. It follows from this that responsibility is necessarily linked to the secret—not, of course, in the form of withholding knowledge regarding a specific decision but in the form of an essential inability to ultimately make the reasons for one’s actions fully transparent. According to this essential Christian conception of responsibility (which is also, for essential reasons, heretical), decision making without secrecy remains u~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Before it was dubbed
         narratology, there was narrative morphology. Vladmir Propp, for instance, disclosed dramatic functions or vehicles rather than characters as the rudiments of the folk tale, abstract and commutable factors underlying portrayed events.4Tapped in this way was the bedrock of the new science. Concerned not with the morphemes and phonemes of language but with the formative units of represented action, such analysis put up little resistance to being reborn, decades later, as structuralist narratology, when its schemata were mapped by A. J. Greimas onto a preformulated communications model of sender and receiver rather than, say, Propp's donor and helper functions.5This transition was smooth enough sailing, of course, because the message function and its means were figured as interior to plot rather than a question first of all of the carrying medium. For that more theory would have been needed—or more something.<br>

Abstract: Habits of self‐restraint, critical self‐analysis, and the willingness to partake in public moral deliberation echo dispositions valorized in classical Greek moral philosophy; they call to mind the virtues of temperance, wisdom, and courage. Such virtues require us to put political power to critical and moral scrutiny. In these respects attention to virtue requires us to develop the prophetic promise of just‐war morality—its potential to generate social criticism and, when necessary, resistance to political power.<br>

Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Despite the evidence marshaled above, the proposition that language works against itself in prayer, stressed to the breaking point by a crisis of referentiality, may still provoke understandable resistance given Coleridge’s sacramental investment in language via the Logos elsewhere (e.g., in
         Biographia Literaria). However, it is a proposition that makes sense if we remember that prayer is fundamentally an act of response made from the condition of human fallenness. TheOpus Maximumis helpful here, depicting a complex but suggestive relationship to Logos. One of its ongoing concerns is to clarify the divine origin of reason (a theme tellingly introduced for the first time via an analogy with language).48Reason in its objective aspect is Logos and fully divine. However, reason in its subjective aspect, as belonging to individuals, is best described as a flawed “act of self‐direction …of opening and of receiving, which may … exist in very different degrees …counteracted or suspended or even suppressed” (emphases mine).49Reason is the Johannine light that “lighteth every man” (John 1:9), offered by God, but human reason is the eye opened imperfectly to that light. Insofar as humanity shares in or responds to the Logos, it does so only in a flawed way that must betray the separation between human and divine wills: “Reason is the presence of God to the <Human> Will independent of its unity with the divine Will. … A Reason that did not contain itself a power of opposing a Reason, or of not being one with it, would be no Reason at all.”50<br>

Abstract: While Grégoire initially undertook these projects with enthusiasm, his faith in the new republican order proved difficult to sustain. The Constitutional Church that Grégoire had so intensely championed became a source of conflict, and he was repeatedly disappointed by his parishioners' resistance to his reforms. The dechristianization movement led by radical Jacobins such as Jacques-René Hébert further alienated him from the Revolution, although he continued to profess belief in its egalitarian values. As Robespierre's government by Terror gave way to Thermidor, the Directory, the Napoleonic regimes, and finally the Restoration, the abbé shifted the focus of his aspirations from the metropole to the colonies, but even here he met with repeated failures. By this time, however, he found himself clinging to a lonely middle ground between Catholic royalism and secular democracy. Likewise, he moved away from the commitment to regenerating society through his own efforts, instead holding out for the possibility of “divine intercession” to overcome human sinfulness (Sepinwall, 109–98, quote on 165).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 07 2010<br>
Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: We have touched upon Rappaport’s point that the more likely people are to violate a convention, the more fixed, more constraining, even more reifying, will be the ritual form that instantiates it. This exhortation seems to reify the oath of the final instructions' section 1. Notable is the sequence of second person imperatives—subordinate one’s soul, incite it, purify it, understand it—which speaks to Tambiah’s analysis of a ritual’s “compelling illocutionary words of command and persuasion or declaration” whose ultimate purpose is to produce “a sense of heightened and intensified and fused communication.”
            63The use of successive imperatives from a family of ideas might be seen as repeating on different frequencies the same core message. As Tambiah has pointed out, the same message may be communicated in a plethora of different ways or by a plethora of symbolic acts that overdetermine the ritual’s message, making it difficult to resist. The imperatives are aimed at inducing a high communicational register and overcoming individual resistance to the sanctified mission.<br>

Abstract: This is already clear in “Literature and the Right to Death,” the essay to which Lévinas was responding in “Reality and Its Shadow.” There Blanchot writes, “where is literature's power? It plays at working in the world, and the world regards its work as a worthless or dangerous game.”
         34Blanchot's rhetoric here is once again remarkably similar to Lévinas's in “Reality and Its Shadow” and is seemingly as negative. Yet what condemns literature for Lévinas redeems it for Blanchot. Ultimately it is the way in which literature deforms action into inaction that gives it its importance. Its function first appears as a resistance to the philosophical concept.<br>

Abstract: My motive here is to bring preexisting scholarship to bear on the project of the moment and thereby to help avoid “reinventing the wheel” in the anthropological study of morality. If this is granted, however, it is legitimate to ask why not include evil of the demonic and diabolical type, as well as witchcraft and sorcery? For present purposes my answer is that the relation of evil to morality is mediated by the demonic realm in a way that is not the case with witchcraft, and in some ways the problem of human evil, or homodicy as I called it above, is peripheral in the literature. Several brief examples will have to suffice. When explicitly addressing “the problem of evil” in his study of devil-beliefs and rites in the milieu of sugar plantations in Colombia and tin mines in Bolivia, Taussig (
         1980) is oriented toward explicating their symbolic/ideological representation of colonial caste and class oppression and confrontation between Christian and indigenous religion. He does so in a way that leans more toward their political and economic than their moral consequences, and toward the restructuring of the relation between the ethical and cosmic order with the Christian introduction of a dualism radically distinguishing good and evil that substituted what he calls a moral for a normative concept of sin. Peasant contracts with the devil are not about evil but about resistance to the threats against cultural integrity, and in addressing the “sociology of evil,” Taussig refers mostly to sorcery rather than to devil-beliefs. Indeed, the aura of Conradesque darkness and cruelty evoked by his later study of shamanic healing during the rubber boom along the Putamayo River is in some ways a more explicit meditation on evil (Taussig1987).<br>

Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: Of course, Lear is not alone in his perplexity. For the better part of four hundred years, audiences, actors, and critics have struggled to make sense of Cordelia’s comportment in the love contest, worrying over her words and wondering about her motives. Some have suggested that she acts as she does because she is confused, either too innocent or too naïve to know what is expected of her. Others have regarded her as obstinate or passive-aggressive, refusing to play her father’s game because it demeans her and devalues love. Still others have seen her as intentionally hurtful, provoking her father so as to expose his arrogance and pride.
      
            What makes it so hard to settle upon a single interpretation is the strange way in which all seem to apply. As oxymoronic as it might be, Cordelia is humble, high-minded, and hostile—all at the same time. Yet this contradictory condition is precisely what Levinas identifies as the principal modality of the other. To look upon the other is to see both mastery and abjection—or, rather, mastery in abjection, since what gives the other power over me is precisely his nudity, destitution, and poverty. Such is Cordelia’s situation in the play’s opening scene. Standing before her father in the place of the inassimilable other, Cordelia confronts the king with a dispossessing defenselessness and a commanding vulnerability. She overwhelms him with what Levinas calls “the resistance of what has no resistance—the ethical resistance.”10

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: The fully fledged Varronian history of religion, dimly visible through the scattered two-hundred sixty fragments of the
         Antiquitates rerum divinarum, tries to construct not a Roman, but a universal history of religion, apt for a Roman polity extended all over Italy, certainly into Greece and beyond, an incipientImperium Romanum. Varro and his dedicatee, Caesar, share a perspective in this regard. This was no unilinear development. New gods were to arrive, who demanded stories about the shrinking of diversity, about resistance to unity and about differentiation judged secondary. In such narratives, conspirators like Sextus Tarquinius and Judas replaced Numa and Fulvius Nobilior.
               Ultimately, histories of “religions” instead of “religion” were written. The concept of the “church of the martyrs,” construing the survivors as legitimate successors to those killed, is put forward by religious historiographers.71
            
               These sharply defined identities are proffered in contradiction to the ambiguity and ambivalences, which obtain in the field of religion. The production of boundaries by historiographers and group leaders must not be allowed to completely obscure the existence and historical significance of the vast array of shared practices in daily life. In areas of the world where multiple (or indistinct) religious identities were the norm, many functions and forms of religious practices and beliefs occurred on a shared field between and above the boundaries invoked by distinct groups.72<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Bonhoeffer believed that Christianity must be something more than the cultural constructions of whatever society it is known within; indeed, when necessary, it must take its stand against the prevailing political and moral orders.
            
                  Even though the embrace of a religionless Christianity takes us to a place of suffering the cross, for Bonhoeffer it has nothing to do with escaping the world in individual piety or otherworldly mysticism. Rather by our very immersion and being in the world—sharing its duties, sorrows, and sufferings—we gain the credibility and authority to call the world into question. Willingness to suffer the wounds of the wounded themselves is by no means equivalent to a move to passivity and surrender to worldly powers; rather it constitutes a place of profound power in powerlessness.127
               
                  Pugh even speculates that a “religionless Christianity could well take the form of public resistance to the ‘way things are.’”128
               
                  Bonhoeffer stresses, however, that confronting power may never come from our power but from the powerlessness that God’s own self experiences in the cross of Jesus. This awareness results in Bonhoeffer’s radical conviction regarding the role of ecclesia in the world: “The church can defend its own sphere … only by battling, not for that sphere but for the salvation of the world. Otherwise the church degenerates into a ‘religious society,’ fighting for its own existence, and thus automatically is no longer God’s church in the world.”129

Abstract: Sontag, by contrast, critiques the way illness and the suffering associated with it become metaphors. In the case of tuberculosis in the Romantic period, for example, the disease became the vehicle in the metaphor that Sontag calls the “secular myth of self-transcendence.” In the twentieth century, she contends, the notions and attitudes that contributed to the creation of such a “master narrative” are split between insanity and cancer, but her argument is that in any era, metaphorizing illness misrepresents that experience of suffering and can lead to rhetoric that blames the patient. If illnesses like TB or insanity express the patient’s character, it is a short step to claiming that the patient somehow caused the illness. “My point,” she writes, “is that illness is
      nota metaphor, and that the most truthful way of regarding illness—and the healthiest way of being ill—is one most purified of, most resistant to, metaphoric thinking.”
            Like Scarry, Sontag urges a resistance to metaphors because the associative process of metaphoric thinking misrepresents and abstracts the “real” experience of the body in pain.8<br>

Abstract: The earlier drawings, produced between late November 1912 and February 1913, depicted a Corinthian order that was quite similar to numerous interpretations found in treatises and collections of drawings from the Renaissance to the late nineteenth century. However, as the scale of the drawings became larger and the line work increasingly refined, the character of the details started to change. On earlier drawings, the height of the column's shafts was about 10 diameters, with the entablature measuring about 2 1⁄4 diameters—as recommended by the majority of theorists. Some of Maybeck's intermediate studies suggested even slenderer columns and different prototypes—probably influenced by additional consultations with d'Espouy's drawings (
         Figure 14; cf.Figure 6).
               The direction of his thought is also apparent from numerical notations indicating the diameters of columns' shafts. Thus a drawing signed on 13 January has notations indicating his hesitation between a diameter of 5 feet 6 inches (which was shown in the final working drawings) and a more delicately proportioned 5 feet 4 inches (see100
            Figure 14).
               The very medium of this and other studies—soft pencil and charcoal—conveys a moody impression. The final design, recorded in the working drawing, clearly reflects the tectonic characteristics of a structural material with low resistance to compression. This is expressed in the 1:8 proportions of the columns—which drew the criticism of purists—and the increased size of the entablature.101<br>

Article Title: Placing Resistance: A Critique of Critical Regionalism<br>
Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
Issue: i262199<br>
Date: 5 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Frampton Keith L.<br>
Abstract: Critical regionalism emerged as an architectural concept during the early 1980s. For leading theorists such as Kenneth Frampton, critical regionalism was an "architecture of resistance" seeking "to mediate the impact of universal civilization" and "to reflect and serve the limited constituencies" in which it was grounded. This paper examines critical regionalist rhetoric, particularly its emphasis on resistance, as a theoretical construct that inadvertently marginalized and conflated the diverse architectural tendencies it championed. The reception of Mexican architect Luis Barragán as a critical regionalist is highlighted to analyze some of critical regionalism's most problematic assumptions, implications, and effects.<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd<br>
Issue: i302185<br>
Date: 6 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Wolf George Clement<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the relation of authority to legitimacy through the social construction of local histories that validate claims to 'authentic' rulership. Using the historical example of the Chiefdom of Uyombe in northern Zambia, I intend to argue that the construction of these local histories has been a crucial element in the process of domination, subjugation, resistance and collaboration between rulers and those they would rule. Exploring specific Gramscian concepts, I will also argue that historical narratives contain hegemonic and ideological components that are critical to relating authority to legitimacy in an active manner. These narratives contain African voices, which express varied local interests. Through the narratives, Africans may be seen as active agents in contributing to the making of their own local histories of rulership. Thus, authority and legitimacy are conjoined through the fabrication, inscription and recitation of historical narratives and are an essential part of governance.<br>

Author(s): Chivallon Christine<br>
Abstract: Cet article s'intéresse au conflit foncier à la Martinique. Il propose l'étude d'une grande propriété — « Providence » — ayant fait l'objet d'une occupation des terres de plus de vingt ans par des agriculteurs voulant ainsi faire valoir leurs droits à la terre. À travers ce conflit, on voit se préciser l'importance de l'espace en tant que porteur d'un langage capable de véhiculer la mémoire collective et de donner forme à l'identité. L'espace prolonge les termes du conflit originel entre maîtres et esclaves au travers d'une codification cadastrée toujours dotée d'efficacité, comme il sert de transmetteur de pratiques d'opposition et de résistance à un tel ordre incarné, devenant ainsi l'une des ressources fondamentales de la continuité identitaire du groupe des petits agriculteurs. This article focuses on the land property conflict in Martinique. The case study is "Providence", a large property that has been occupied for twenty years by a group of farmers who claim their rights to the land. In hee we can see how space is of crucial importance in providing the collective memory with words loaded with significations and contributing to the construction of identity. The memory of the old masters-slave conflict is embodied in space through an ever efficient social and racial codification. Space is also a tool to transmit a set of practises of resistance to this physical order and, in this way, becomes a fundamental resource to construct the collective identity of the group of small farmers<br>

Publisher: The Society of Christian Ethics<br>
Issue: i23557606<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Richardson R. Neville<br>
Abstract: What is the direction of South African theological ethics as that country moves out of the apartheid era into a new democratic future? Following its struggle against apartheid, how will theology respond to the new challenge of making clear its distinctive stance in a democratic, multi-faith society with a secular constitution? A danger, similar to that previously discussed in the United States, exists in South Africa as theology evolves from a mode of resistance to that of compliance and accommodation, especially under the guise of "nation-building." The essay plots a trajectory by means of a consideration of four works representing nonracial liberationist theology which emerged at key points in the past fifteen years—the Kairos Document (1985), and works by Albert Nolan (1988), Charles Villla-Vicencio (1992), and James Cochrane (1999). For all their contextual sensitivity and strength, these works appear to offer little of a distinctively theological nature, and little of Christian substance to church and society. The way lies open for the development of an African Christian ethics.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917915<br>
Date: 12 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Bongmba Elias<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests that the images of love in Ngugi's first written novel, The River Between can be read as a phenomenology of love. Such a phenomenology demonstrates that the love Waiyaki, the main character, has for Nyambura points to a conciliatory path in resistance to colonialism. It is argued that although the main character fails in his mission, his declaration of love for the daughter of the pastor, who opposes indigenous practices, is an erotic manifestation that is a rejection of partisan spirit as well as a critique of Christian praxis in colonial Kenya, and could serve as a basis for reconfiguring contemporary gender relations.<br>

Abstract: Le terme de Monarchomaque renvoie à cinq critères: le rejet de la tyrannie, la double alliance, la souveraineté du peuple, l'obéissance conditionnelle, enfin le droit de résistance armée. A partir de là, il est possible d'établir un corpus monarchomaque composé de dix textes. Ce corpus permet de conduire une étude des liens entre théorie politique et représentation du temps. Celle-ci porte à la fois sur les origines de la monarchie et sur les traces du passé dans le présent (Etats). The monarchomach theory is based on five criteria: the rejection of tyranny, the mutual alliance, the sovereignty of the people, limited obedience, and finally the right to armed resistance. Such a definition leads to the establishment of a corpus of ten monarchomach treatises. This corpus allows us to study the links between political theory and the representation of time. This latter subject involves both the origins of the monarchy and the traces of the past in the present (the Estates). Der Begriff von «Monarchomaque» verweist auf fünf Kriterien: die Ablehnung der Tyrannei, die verdoppelte Allianz, die Souveränität des Volkes, der bedingte Gehorsam, schließlich das Recht bewaffneten Widerstandes. Von daher ist es möglich, ein aus zehn Texten zusammengesetztes «monarchomaque» Corpus aufzustellen. Dieser Bestand erlaubt, eine Studie der Verbindungen zwischen politischer Theorie und Darstellung der Zeit zu führen. Sie bezieht sich sowohl auf die Ursprünge der Monarchie als auch auf die Spuren der Vergangenheit in der Gegenwart (Staaten).<br>

Abstract: Sven Arntzen arrive, par une analyse détaillée, à une conclusion qui n'est
pas loin de l'idée de J. Patocka : « Duty to oneself requires that one resist
political authority under certain circumstances and thus is a basis for
permissible resistance. ».Kant on duty to oneself and resistance to political
authority, in Journal of the History of Philosophy, juilllet 1996, vol. 34, n°3,
pp. 409 sq. Il faut ajouter que la parole kantienne « Ne devenez point esclaves
des hommes. Ne souffrez pas que votre droit soit impunément foulé aux pieds
par les autres » a dans le texte de Kant une portée limitée. Elle avertit contre la
perte de l'indépendance économique de l'individu (car les dettes peuvent
mener à ce qu'on devienne mendiant), contre la génuflexion devant les images
et contre un comportement trop révérencieux par rapport aux hommes
(lorsqu'il exprime par exemple la différence des états, la courtoisie mutuelle
entre égaux étant en revanche compatible avec l'estime de soi-même). Ces
formes d'estime n'ont aucune dimension politique et Kant ne provoque pas à
une résistance dans le cadre de la défense contre l'injustice. Et pourtant, les
analyses de Patoika et Arntzen peuvent s'appuyer sur l'œuvre de Kant dans
son ensemble. Du point de vue d'ensemble, le droit à la résistance chez Kant
n'est pas seulement une question de légalité, mais de moralité.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i24708650<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): GOLDBERG SYLVIE ANNE<br>
Abstract: This article explores the reception of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi in France in light of the many and diverse reactions his books and lectures engendered at major conferences and meetings. It describes how the American scholar became one of the leading figures among French intellectuals after the first translation of his book Zakhor in 1984 and his first lecture at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in 1987, which resulted in a series of annual lectures over the next ten years. Following the readings of Jacques Derrida, Paul Ricœur, Pierre Vidal-Naquet, and François Furet, among other intellectuals, the eminent standing achieved by Yerushalmi coincided with a special "moment." At a time when doubt was cast on the testimonies of living witnesses and when the words of Holocaust deniers and of members of the French Resistance were treated on equal terms, the politics of memory challenged the status of history and historians. This paper aims to recover the atmosphere of these past decades and to elucidate how Yerushalmi's name has become inseparable from the issues linked with the debates about history and memory.<br>

Publisher: West Chester University<br>
Issue: i25115452<br>
Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Templeton Alice<br>
Abstract: What is the use of writing poems against war if they reenact rather than alter the binaries and brutalities of the war imagination they claim to protest? Why does so much contemporary war poetry only compound war's depleting effect instead of offering us energy for resistance? In The Life of Poetry (1949), Muriel Rukeyser defines poetry as a vital but underused national resource for a culture dominated by war. As a creative transfer of energy, poetry complicates and resists habits of imagination that sustain war. Using Rukeyser's analysis to contrast a representative poem from the volume Poets Against the War (2003) to several poems by Forche, Celan, James Wright, Blake, Yeats, Oppen, and Levertov, this paper discusses ways in which poetry about war and wartime can provide useful, life-giving energy without replicating the very violences it claims to oppose.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i25167549<br>
Date: 4 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Harb Sirène<br>
Abstract: This article explores how Gayl Jones's "Corregidora" constructs, through the journey of its main protagonist Ursa Corregidora, a viable model for dealing with the painful legacy of slavery, oppression and haunting by the past. The process of self-redefinition in which Ursa engages is based on the reconfiguration of family and sexuality and the hybridization of her relationship to individual as well as collective narratives. After probing Ursa's complex psychological journey, the article examines the main elements mediating the reinscription of her life narrative into a broader context of métissage involving sexual and historical resistance, anchored in the story of Palmares as a Brazilian maroon community (quilombo). Finally, the article analyzes the implications and resonances of this model of revision/reclamation for Gayl Jones and her theorization of the interconnectedness of struggles against oppression in Brazil and the United States.<br>

Author(s): Rothberg Michael<br>
Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Author(s): Christensen Peter G.<br>
Abstract: Georg Groddeck (1866-1934), one of the marginalized figures in the history of early psychoanalysis, defended homosexuality in his epistolary novel of 1923, Das Buch vom Es, published with the encouragement of Freud by the Psychoanalytischer Verlag in Vienna. Unfortunately, Groddeck's contribution to thinking about homosexuality during the inter-war period has been overlooked. His autobiographical narrator, Troll, claims that homosexuality is more characteristic of humans than heterosexuality. Societal disapproval of homosexuality, he feels, stems from negative feelings about masturbation. Groddeck supports these two ideas better than he does his more famous concept of the Es, which he uses to explain why humans contract diseases they want, despite apparent anger at or resistance to these maladies. Recent interest in Groddeck has somewhat waned due to exposure of his vehement racism, but further study of his views on sexuality in the light of poststructural psychoanalysis should be rewarding.<br>

Abstract: A social psychologist dissatisfied with the oversocialized conceptions of man which predominate in sociology may well seek in the psychoanalytic theory of the instincts a countervailing individuality and a hard core of human nature as a basis for resistance to social determinism and relativism. Nevertheless, man appears to be a "denatured" and symbolling, rather than an instinctual creature. The mechanistic and biologistic psychoanalytic metapsychology has obscured Freud's central discovery of the unconscious dimensions of man's reality-constructing activity. Intrapsychic conflict and man's resistance to socialization arise not from any clash between nature (instinct) and culture (civilization), but from contradictions between conscious and unconscious fantasies and among the varying projects and definitions related to different moments of a person's biography. While social psychologists need to be reminded of man's unconscious symbolic action and interaction, psychoanalysts must be recalled (perhaps by the followers of Mead, as well as by disciples of Lacan) to the essentially semiotic character of their enterprise. In both disciplines the task is hermeneutic more than ontological: our aim is less to reveal Reality than to describe our varying (personal and social) "realities" and their expression in the myths and metaphors we live by -- consciously, preconsciously and unconsciously. /// Un psychologue social insatisfait des conceptions sursocialisées de l'homme qui prédominent en sociologie peut très bien chercher dans la théorie psychanalytique des instincts une individualité compensatoire, un noyau dur de nature humaine comme base de résistance au déterminisme et relativisme social. Néanmoins, l'homme paraît un être "dénaturé" et vivant de symboles plutôt qu'un être d'instinct. La métapsychologie psychanalytique (mecaniste et "biologitique") a obscurci la découverte centrale de Freud de la dimension inconsciente de l'activité constructive du réel de l'homme. Les~<br>

Abstract: Concerns with how cultural factors influenced agrarian social change remained an abiding interest in the work of James Scott. I begin by sketching out the context of debates in Marxist theory, development studies, and social and political anthropology that, during the 1980s, turned to relations between ideas, power, and processes of conflict and change in a world of new postcolonial nations and rapid agrarian development. In the article, then, I carefully examine the ideas Scott developed about resistance and hegemony in conversation with the work of E. P. Thompson. Tracing the genealogy of Scott's ideas about hegemony and rural social protest, I comment in some detail on the literature on resistance that arose in anthropology during the 1980s and the role of Scott's "Weapons of the Weak" (1985) in shaping that literature while interacting with "Subaltern Studies" (Guha 1982-87), studies of social movements, and examinations of power in interpersonal relations.<br>

Abstract: Narratives of the Tibetan resistance army are not a part of national history in the Tibetan exile community. Drawing on stories by veterans of the resistance to the Chinese invasion and the explanations they give of its absence in Tibetan national history, I argue that this history has been "arrested" because of the challenges it poses to normative versions of history and community and, in turn, to internal and external representations of Tibet. This practice signifies the postponing of narrating certain histories until a time in the future when the dangers they pose to sustaining a unified Tibetan community in exile has receded. This practice of historical (un)production offers insight into temporality and subjectivity, plural identities in the face of national hegemony, and why history might be considered a combination of truth, fear, and lies.<br>

Author(s): Malraux Vincent<br>
Abstract: Inspiré du récit de Joseph Kessel, "L'Armée des ombres," film de Jean-Pierre Melville, semble à bien des égards symboliser ce qu'a été l'engagement résistant. Mais s'agissait-il de représenter la Résistance ou de réfléchir sur les termes de sa figuration? Retour sur un film - mal reçu à sa sortie - qui constitue un cas d'école. Film inspiré du récit de Joseph Kessel, L'Armée des ombres ne constitue pas un film sur la Résistance, mais présente une réflexion sur les termes de sa figuration. Melville n'était sans doute pas mal placé pour proposer cette réflexion, comme cinéaste, bien sûr, mais comme résistant également - encore que son itinéraire, durant les années sombres, soit difficile à retracer. Le film, à sa sortie, fut mal reçu, en raison notamment d'une approche jugée gaulliste. Le décalage temporel nous montre pourtant que cette œuvre reste rebelle à toute classification. Tout en étant largement fidèle au récit de Kessel, elle élimine toute référence au politique, choisit de présenter la Résistance dans la variété de ses membres - qu'unit toutefois la mort qui les attend. Elle se caractérise surtout par une sobriété proche de l'épure qui évite, notamment, de transfigurer les résistants en héros. Melville, au demeurant, préfère filmer les hommes dans la délibération plutôt que dans l'action - une approche qui tranche avec les partis pris retenus par Claude Berri dans Lucie Aubrac. Les acteurs - connus - n'en sont pas moins devenus, aux yeux des spectateurs, l'incarnation symbolique mais vivante des résistants qui forgèrent l'armée des ombres. /// Le visage de l'histoire. A film inspired by Joseph Kessel's accounting, "The Army of the Shadows" is not a film on the Resistance, but presents thinking on the terms of its representations.

Issue: i292445<br>
Date: 4 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Zimra Michael F.<br>
Abstract: Assia Djebar's most recent text, "La femme sans sepulture," returns to the site of colonial history to represent the voice of resistance hero Zoulikha, a haunting figure of the author's own personal history represented only nominally in her corpus until now. Representing Zoulikha's return in Algeria as a spectral revisitation, Djebar's text examines both the potential and the vicissitudes of representing colonial violence and resistance through the spectral domain and thus engages critically with tendencies of postcolonial theory to promote haunting as a mode of historical reinscription. Djebar's text explores how haunting relates to cultural and postcolonial memory through an investigation of the issues surrounding the inscription of Zoulikha's story of resistance and torture within the colonial context, and thereby queries the relation between the haunting memories of colonial violence and contemporary civil warfare in Algeria. This article explores, in particular, how Djebar's work engages critically with the spectral aura that haunts both postcolonial place and theory.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000755<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Gregory Eric<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a remarkable document that has escaped critical attention within the vast literature on John Rawls, religion, and liberalism: Rawls's undergraduate thesis, "A Brief Inquiry into the Meaning of Sin and Faith: An Interpretation Based on the Concept of Community" (1942). The thesis shows the extent to which a once regnant version of Protestant theology has retreated into seminaries and divinity schools where it now also meets resistance. Ironically, the young Rawls rejected social contract liberalism for reasons that anticipate many of the claims later made against him by secular and religious critics. The thesis and Rawls's late unpublished remarks on religion and World War II offer a new dimension to his intellectual biography. They show the significance of his humanist response to the moral impossibility of political theology. Moreover, they also reveal a kind of Rawlsian piety marginalized by contemporary debates over religion and liberalism.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000790<br>
Date: 10 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Ferreira M. Jamie<br>
Abstract: Levinas's ethics of other-centered service has been criticized at the theoretical level for failing to offer a conception of moral agency adequate to ground its imperative and at the practical level for encouraging self-hatred. Levinas's explicit resistance to the incorporation of the phrase "as yourself" in the Judaeo-Christian love command might seem to validate the critics' complaints. The author argues, on the contrary, that Levinas does offer a strong and compelling conception of moral agency and that his ethics, properly understood, does not entail self-abnegation. Levinas's attempt to counter excessive and manipulative self-concern and self-inflation by insisting on the dependent and situational position of the self has been wrongly overinterpreted as an abandonment of the self and its just claims. The author seeks to establish a more balanced understanding by focusing attention on the "ethics of welcome," on Levinas's distinctive conception of passivity, and on the role of "the third" in all human relations.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics.

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Dédié à l'étude du rôle de l'intelligentsia roumaine dans la mise en œuvre des politiques mémorielles, cet article met en évidence trois fonctions de la mémoire : l'accréditation mémorielle de la reproduction démocratique des élites culturelles du communisme, la mise en cause historique de la mémoire d'une résistance intellectuelle anticommuniste et finalement le rôle de la mémoire du communisme dans la rhétorique identitaire de divers groupes de l'intelligentsia. Studying the responsibility of Romanian intelligentsia in the implementation of memorial politics, this article examines three complementary questions : memorial accreditation of democratic conversion of communist intelligentsia, historical contestation of intellectual resistance against communist regime, and eventually, the role of communist memory in the intelligentsia's contemporary rhetoric of identity. Drei Aufgaben der Erinnerung hebt dieser Artikel, der sich der Rolle der rumänischen Intelligenzija bei der Umsetzung einer Erinnerungspolitik widmet, hervor : die dauerhafte Festschreibung der demokratischen Reproduktion der kulturellen Eliten des Kommunismus ; das Infragestellen der Erinnerung der Intellektuellen im antikommunistischen Widerstand und letztlich die kommunistische Erinnerung, in ihrer sich selbst beschreibenden Rhetorik verschiedener Gruppen der rumänischen Intelligenzija.<br>

Abstract: L'attachement au pays d'origine est bien analysé pour les diasporas contemporaines afin de démontrer leur dimension transnationale et décrire leurs rapports avec l'État-nation. Pour les XVIe-XVIIIe siècles, en revanche, cette question pourtant fondamentale est minorée au profit des liens entre communautés. Souhaitant sortir des perspectives mono-confessionnelles qui limitent l'historiographie des diasporas modernes, ce travail s'appuie sur l'étude de quatre groupes dispersés : les séfarades, les catholiques britanniques, les huguenots et les morisques. La terre d'origine, qui grave son empreinte culturelle sur la diaspora, constitue un liant structurant fondamental : lieu de l'événement-déclencheur de dispersion et du martyre, elle apparaît comme le front de la résistance qui légitime l'existence de « l'arrière » , la diaspora. Territoire matriciel, souvent mythifié et mobilisé dans les visions messianiques, elle est indissociable de la notion de retour. The attachment to the country of origin is well analyzed for contemporary diasporas to demonstrate their transnational dimension and to describe their relationship with the nation-state. For the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, however, the historiography has emphasized the relationship between communities, overlooking this important issue. Putting aside mono-denominational perspectives, this article offers a new approach to early-modern diasporas by confronting four groups: the Sephardim, the British Catholics, the Huguenots and the Moriscos. The cultural imprint of the homeland was a core structure of diasporas. The locus of both martyrdom and the trigger-event of dispersion, the homeland appeared as the front line of resistance, legitimizing the existence of the "rear", i.e. the Diaspora. Often mythologized and mobilized in messianic visions, this crucial territory was inseparable from the notion of return.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40072402<br>
Date: 8 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Ally Shireen<br>
Abstract: Despite its manifest, if largely undocumented, histories of menacing violence and perilous politics, the thrust of popular memory in the former apartheid bantustan of KaNgwane insists that it was a peaceful, even apolitical, place. In a contemporary South African memorial culture that idealizes memories of victimization by (and resistance to) apartheid and its political violence, why would some in KaNgwane persistently narrate the past through tropes of peaceful order and disavowals of the political? Are these mnemonic effacements in KaNgwane best conceived of as forms of forgetting? This article challenges such a proposition. First, it recovers the hitherto unrecognized politics and violence in KaNgwane, in part (and paradoxically) out of the very same narratives that deny such histories. Second, it explores the dialectical co-implication of remembering and forgetting, and of memory and history, in KaNgwane's supposed anamnesis. And third, it proposes that the occlusions and assurances of memory in KaNgwane are structured by a localized semiotics in which politics is retrospectively signified by order and restraint, and negated by disorder and revolt. In this ' memory work', KaNgwane's past is anaesthetized of violence, and heroism is recovered not from rehearsals of victimization and resistance, but from memories of pacified civility instead. Malgré son passé manifeste (bien que non documenté pour l'essentiel) de violence menaçante et de politique périlleuse, la mémoire populaire de l'ancien bantoustan de KaNgwane sous le régime de l'apartheid insiste, dans ses grandes lignes, sur le caractère paisible et apolitique du lieu. Dans une culture de mémoire sud-africaine contemporaine qui idéalise les mémoires de victimisation par (et de résistance à) l'apartheid et sa violence politique, pourquoi certains à KaNgwane persistent-ils à narrer le passé à travers des tropes d'ordre paisible et de désaveu du politique? Faut-il concevoir ces effacements mnémoniques au KaNgwa~<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i40079950<br>
Date: 9 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Murthy Viren<br>
Abstract: Although ZhangTaiyan is famous for being a late Qing nationalist and revolutionary, scholars have yet to explore fully the significance of his Buddhist writings, especially as they relate to time and history. This article closely examines Zhang's writings about time and history and points out that Zhang made two interrelated but potentially conflicting arguments. On the one hand, he invoked Yogācāra Buddhism and Zhuang Zi to expound a relativistic vision of time and history. From this perspective, each nation has its historical particularity and cannot be judged from an external standard. However, on the other hand, in a context where intellectuals were uncritically adopting a framework of history as progress, Zhang grounded the theory of evolution in a theory of karmic seeds to develop an interpretation of history as a double movement in which the good gets better and the bad gets worse. The article delves into the significance of Zhang's arguments by highlighting the symmetries between Zhang's exposition of history and the logic of capitalism. Such structural similarities suggest that Zhang could think about time and history in this way precisely because he inhabited a world mediated by the dynamic of capitalism. His writings on Zhuang Zi and Buddhism should be seen as an example of a resistance to capitalism that is not based on a narrative of progress. In the context of twentieth-century Chinese intellectual history, where narratives of progress and evolution are a dominant chord, Zhang's counterpunctual critique of evolution is especially inspiring.<br>

Author(s): Hoßfeld Heiko<br>
Abstract: This paper considers how companies use their own mass communication media to create, with the aid of metaphors, a legitimizing image of their practices. The analysis is based on the example of two banks, both of which undertook massive staff and cost reductions between 2001 and 2003. Downsizing measures like theirs are often met with resistance if they conflict with the interests, values or worldviews of stakeholders. Companies approach this threat of resistance by building a linguistic façade of legitimacy that suggests conformity with prevailing ideas of good or correct managerial conduct. Our metaphor analysis, which covers all publicly accessible texts of the two banks' own mass communication, identifies nine metaphoric concepts, which we further condense into three persuasive meta concepts: concealing metaphor, euphemistic metaphor, and urgency and control metaphor each fulfil different persuasive functions and vary systematically according to the conditions surrounding the managerial practice.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40085908<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Pestre Dominique<br>
Abstract: What I consider in this paper are various forms of government, various technologies and discursive regimes of government that are in common use today. What interests me are the categories and tools, practical dispositifs and languages that developed over the last decades 'to constitute, define, organize, and instrumentalize the strategies that individuals, acting freely, may use to deal with one another' (Foucault). The paper considers first the neo-liberal wish to reassert the individual as alone in responsibility for his/her own life after the unfortunate digression into Welfare Statism and Keynesian economics, source of all ills. It then focuses on some material and social technologies that encourage people to accept full and complete 'self-sovereignty'. This section leads to a discussion on the new demands (and resistance) society imposed on this liberal normative ideal. It notably considers the growing demands to 'participate' in decision processes and to be environmentally friendly. In section "Les Mots et Les Choses: A New Discursive Regime", it considers the discursive regime that progressively took shape and which currently permeates international governance bodies of all stripes—from the World Bank to the Conference of Parties for Climate Change. In the final section, it comes back to the initial question and considers what these changes actually mean for the democratic order as constituted over the past 250 years.<br>

Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
Issue: i40090341<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Hatch John B.<br>
Abstract: The book Letters Across the Divide: Two Friends Explore Racism, Friendship, and Faith embodies a dialogic rhetoric with significant potential to influence its intended audience to accept the need for racial atonement and reconciliation. It exemplifies what Aaron Gresson calls a "dance of agency" in both its interpersonal exchanges and constructed relationship with readers. Bringing white and black voices, individual and collective concerns, and (interpersonal and public discourse into dialogue, Letters demonstrates the transformative power of "voice," which mediates the "authenticity" of Buberian dialogic rhetoric and the cultural performances of Bakhtinian dialogism. The fact that the white coauthor boldly affirms commonplaces of white resistance increases the likelihood that white readers would identify with and be influenced by his profound attitudinal change in dialogue with his black friend. The coherence and credibility ofthat transformation depend upon the prefigurai power of the authors' shared religious narrative—both enabling and constraining Letters' influence on public racial reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I partake in a self-inventory to textually narrate for you as well as myself the relationship, as I experience it, between stories and theories in my intellectual life. My autobiographical reflections span the period of the 1947 partition in Indian history, as experienced by my family, to my own journey as a scholar. I tell you, in personal narrative and essay form, a family story of resistance to "refugee narratives" as a story of inherited displacements that interrogates the ontology of my intellectual leanings, by showing the various limens (see Turner's The Anthropology of Performance) that I continue to encounter in my struggles to story. In doing so, I articulate my resistance to theory, my leanings toward storying, and the ongoing struggle to reside in the liminal space between stories and theories. I show myself caught in intellectual limens. While I do not propose any way out of them, I believe that explorations such as these are necessary for scholars to reflect, interrogate, and embody to honestly pursue their intellectual endeavors.<br>

Abstract: From the Balfour declaration of 1917 to the birth of Israel in 1948 a great catastrophe (Nakba) crashed down on Palestine which afterwards got worse with the exodus of the major part of Palestinian population and reached an highest point with the arab defeat of 1967 (Naksa,). During the following period (Nahda) the Palestinians pursued an increasing visibility through military resistance, Intifadah, political initiative and cultural mobilization. The Author stigmatizes the mistakes of Palestinian leaders as well as the colonial policy carried on by Israel. Recollecting the experience of the South-African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he thinks that a true reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis will be impossible if they don't enter in a different mood, forgiving about Nakba and Shoah respectively and trying to convert their common pain and sorrow into hope and confidence in a shared future. Depuis la déclaration Balfour de 1917 jusqu'á la résolution du partage-découpage de la Palestine en 1947 et á la création d'Israël en 1948 la Palestine fit l'expérience d'une grande catastrophe (Nakba), qui devint tragique dans les années suivantes lorsqu'on assista á un véritable éclatement du corps social palestinien et culmina dans la défaite de 1967 (Naksaj. L'aprés-guerre de 1967 marqua un tournant majeur dans la mesure où les Palestiniens accédérent á la visibilité par la resistance militaire, par le soulévement dans les territoires occupés (Intifadah), par l'inititaive politique et par la mobilisation culturelle (Nahda). L'Auteur stigmatise soit les erreurs commis par les directions palestiniennes soit la politique coloniale pratiquée par Israël. Il voit dans l'obsession du Nakba pour les uns et de la Shoah pour les autres des obstacles qu'ilfaut dépasser pour ouvrir la voie d'une réconciliation véritable entre Palestiniens et Israéliens.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'article qu'on va lire, Ludivine Bantigny retrace la généalogie du concept d'historicité, ses différentes déclinaisons et ses enjeux pour les sciences sociales en général et l'histoire en particulier. Ce texte propose d'examiner les definitions de la notion d'«historicités», d'explorer les usages qui en sont faits ou pourraient en être faits par les sciences sociales en général et par l'histoire en particulier, et de réfléchir à ce qui a été nommé le «présentisme». Si la définition est loin d'être figée, on peut entendre par historicité la capacité qu'ont les acteurs d'une société ou d'une communauté donnée à inscrire leur présent dans une histoire, à le penser comme situé dans un temps non pas neutre mais signifiant, par la conception qu'ils s'en font, les interprétations qu'ils s'en donnent et les récits qu'ils en forgent. L'historicité suppose une conscience mouvante et changeante du passé et du futur, façonnée à l'aune du présent. Il est dès lors important d'insister sur la pluralité des modes d'historicités et done sur leur coexistence. Par là, il s'agit de considérer les formes d'historicités dominantes et les résistances qui peuvent aussi lui être opposées. This text analyzes the definitions of the notion "historicities", explores how the social sciences in general and history in particular uses or could use it and considers what has been called "presentism". While the definition is not at all fixed, historicity can be understood as how the players of a society or a community fit their present into a history, how they think it as situated in a time that is not neutral but signifying, by the conception they have of it, the interpretations they give and the accounts they make of it. Historicity implies a moving and changing consciousness of the past and the future, shaped by the present. It is thus important to emphasize the plurality of types of historicities and thus of their coexistence. The forms of dominant historicities and the resistance that can b~<br>

Abstract: Following debates within this journal regarding the absence of adequate studies of resistance in the contemporary fields of industrial sociology and organisational behaviour, this paper seeks to understand its reasons and consequences. Through an examination of the history of approaches to the study of power and resistance at work, the grounds for this debate are considered and illuminated. The paper then suggests how this debate might be taken forward through developing the ideas of tactics and strategies and episodic and dispositional power.<br>

Abstract: This study, based largely on unpublished material, is an attempt to describe and evaluate how French Protestantism dealt with the German question in the postwar period. A short description of the perception of Germany by French Protestants towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century underlines the new approach which characterized the relations between French and German Protestants after the Second World War. In spite of the shattering defeat of the Third Reich, Germany remained in the eyes of many French Protestants a dreadful danger. However, already shortly after the war, some clergymen and laymen, many of whom had been involved in the resistance against the nazi regime, believed that their mission was to act as mediators and peacemakers despite the official hard-line diplomacy of their country. This article provides a selection of quotations of French Protestants' intentions and conceptions regarding the German question, as well as examining the ways and means they thought best to prevent Germany from becoming a new danger to France and Europe. It shows how seriously they debated all aspects of a common future with yesterday's enemy in a Europe of tomorrow, and affords an insight into how some Protestant personalities on both sides of the Rhine played an important role in the process of Franco-German reconciliation during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: Cette contribution examine l'incertitude et le bouleversement des temps sociaux, à l'aune de l'unification des deux polices de Berlin, depuis la chute du mur, le 9 novembre 1989, jusqu'à l'unification allemande, au 3 octobre 1990. Berlin, à la fois communauté urbaine et Lana politico-administratif, a subitement vu deux polices sur son sol. Deux polices, deux histoires distinctes construites 40 ans durant, en opposition réciproque. Le temps fut décisif dans l'unification de ces deux polices, la seule qui ait contraint les agents à travailler effectivement ensemble, dans l'intimité des mêmes postes et des mêmes patrouilles. Le passé des institutions, appelé en résistance contre l'avenir, le présent des configurations politiques locales, mais aussi l'anticipation de l'avenir par les agents individuels et la temporalité propre de la police, son imbrication dans le quotidien, dans la routine de l'ordre public, toutes ces dimensions du temps ont absorbé la puissance de l'événement pour rendre l'impensable possible. This contribution examines the uncertainty and the social changes through the question of the Berlin two police forces'unification, from the fall of the Wall, November 9,1989, to the German unification at October 3, 1990. Berlin, at the same time urban community and political-administrative Land, suddenly saw two police forces on its ground. Two police forces : two distinct stories built 40 years during, in reciprocal opposition. Time was decisive in the unification of these two police forces, the only one which has constrained the agents to work indeed together, in the intimacy of the same stations and the same patrols. Past of the institutions, called in resistance against the future, present of the local political configurations, but also the anticipation of the future by the individual agents and the police force's own temporality, its overlap in the everyday life, the routine of the public order, all these dimensions of time absorbed the power of the event~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to provide a quick survey of William James's views on the plurality of visions that humans have regarding reality, as a background for more extensive discussions of his views on the plurality of values that orient human thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, as well as his views on the enactment of those values through active resistance to the ways things are and the risk-taking involved in striving to improve the human condition. Consonant with pluralism itself, I intend this discussion to open up rather than close off further considerations of James's views on ethics.<br>

Abstract: The Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation considerably deepened the moral and philosophical understanding of the concept of evil. Building on the early Christian Fathers and especially on Augustine's seminal analyses of the causes and effects of the human fall, post-Reformation thinkers at once adopted and modified his refutation of Manichean evil with ideas imported from John Calvin, Jacobus Arminius, and later, from "natural" or rational religion. Given the current resistance to standard theological explanations of evil, this article centers on the rational approaches associated first with Richard Hooker and then with his most radical disciple, Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Tracing the development of rational ideas of evil, the article examines these ideas' exploration in literature by William Shakespeare and John Milton in the characters of Macbeth and Satan.<br>

Abstract: To discuss the practice of memory and its relations to politics, social scientists rely on three kinds of practices - memorialising, memorising and the act of remembering/forgetting. The commemoration of "1857" is unique in that official celebrations of the event have been instituted even as 1857 continues to refigure in myths and endures as a symbol of popular resistance. The articles in this special issue address the seeming contradictions and complexities that "remembering" 1857 involves, and the tension that prevails between different kinds of recall.<br>

Abstract: D'un côté, l'Enquête d'Hérodote rapporte les projets de domination qui, de Crésus à Xerxès, constituent la trame des rapports entre Grecs et Barbares, de 561 à 479. Mais, de l'autre, le lecteur ne peut oublier que de larges sections décrivent les coutumes et l'espace de nombreux peuples dès que la conquête les menace. Cette dynamique s'enracine dans les conditions matérielles de création et de lecture au Ve siècle avant J.-C, et dans les héritages narratifs que transforme Hérodote (Vies, Catalogues ...). Or aucun conquérant n'est glorifié ni présenté comme un vainqueur, tandis que les peuples visés opposent la singularité de leur espace et l'étrangeté de leurs coutumes, soit un genre de vie devenu stratégie de résistance, en associant particularisme insulaire et fuite calculée sur le modèle nomade. Les Grecs, de même, tantôt conquérants insatiables mais défaits, tantôt résistants invaincus, contribuent à monter que, chez Hérodote, l'autre a le visage de celui qui résiste plutôt que du Barbare. Il s'agit donc bien d'une autre écriture du passé, qui sauve de l'oubli tous les peuples décrits, non les seuls hauts faits des Rois. Les mêmes images sont employées pour décrire la résistance insulaire des nomades, et pour dire le cheminement de l'écriture, ainsi en relation d'homologie avec son objet. On one hand, Herodotus' Inquiry reports the plan of domination which from Croesus to Xerxes composes the system of the relation between Greeks and Barbarians, from 561 to 479. But on the other hand, the reader cannot forget that large sections describe customs and many people's area when they are threatened by conquest. This discrepancy has its roots in the material conditions of creativity and reading in the fifth century B.C., and to the narrative forms available to Herodotus (Lives, Lists...). However, no conqueror was praised nor spoken of as a victor, while people shown opposed their individual space and their peculiar customs, that is to say a way of life set up as a stra~<br>

Author(s): Centemeri Laura<br>
Abstract: Through an analysis of the 40-year history of conflicts triggered by the repeated attempts to expand the Malpensa airport in northern Italy, this paper seeks to show the heuristic strength of using the concept of modes of valuation of the environment to discuss the transformations of environmental critique over time in their relation to social change. I argue that, beyond empirical specifics, the trajectory witnessed in this case – from public participation to place-based resistance – reflects more generalized dynamics that can be found in many other conflicts over large infrastructural projects in contemporary Europe. The article is organized as follows: in the first section I briefly introduce the concept of modes of valuation of the environment, which is inspired by recent work in pragmatic sociology. In particular, I distinguish between universal, local, and emplaced modes of valuation. In the second and third sections I provide an analysis of the struggles against the Malpensa airport expansion from 1970 to 2014. Here, I distinguish three phases of mobilization, which I discuss in terms of the transformations that can be observed in the arguments that actors develop to fight or support the airport expansion. I argue that these transformations are articulated not only with changing action repertoires but also with evolving social and sociotechnical imaginarles that convey specific understandings of the environment as a matter of political concern. This analysis shows that, far from being simply a case of citizens' resistance to change, the mobilization against the Malpensa airport has contributed to producing the cultural basis of an increased collective reflexivity about the many values that the environment takes on among community members in the airport region. In the final section I discuss some hypotheses concerning what modes of valuation of the environment reveal about the emergence of a new radicalism in environmental struggles.<br>

Author(s): Woeber Stefan<br>
Abstract: This article looks at the beginnings of anti-apartheid/anticolonial literary cultures in Johannesburg and Maputo (then Lourenqo Marques) after the Second World War. It pays specific attention to the ways in which they attempted to harness aesthetics of "newness." By focusing on the influential journals Drum (1951-) and Itinerário (1941-1955), I argue that both journals tapped into transnational intellectual currents such as Harlem Renaissance writing, but that the discrete discursive networks of English and Portuguese contributed to a differentiation of their aesthetic approaches. Itinerdrio acted out an avantgarde-like resistance to bourgeois/colonial culture. Drum was market-driven and achieved in its early phase a compromise between a racially circumscribed mass-cultural appeal and the literate ideals of mission-educated South African blacks. These differences can then be factored into an analysis of persistent differences between the literatures of South Africa and Mozambique.<br>

Author(s): Wolterstorff Roger<br>
Abstract: Modern critical theory is commonly thought of as a collection of diverse methods, schools, systems, and approaches. There is, however, a significant pattern in the diversity. This pattern is generated by the conflict between the widespread effort of twentieth-century theorists to make criticism scientific and the internal resistance to that effort presented by the hermeneutic impulse. The scientific tradition is characterized and unified by a set of common theoretical principles and by a common sequence of transformations that each school within it undergoes. The result of these transformations is that every proposed scientific model for criticism changes into an interpretive method and the project of scientific criticism is subverted.<br>

Abstract: Mallarmé constructs a "crisis of verse" that mimes the circumstances of loss and the moment of lamentation to produce his celebrated poetic purity. Indeed, he constructs this purity out of the materials of ritual and philosophical defilement: not only does his poetic theory valorize death and danger, but his poetic practice largely relies on contact with the foreign, on semantic contagion, and on ambiguity. The significance of this defilement spreads in multiple directions: it is instrumental in producing newness and in mediating Mallarmé's professional rivalry with Wagner, it bears witness to the domestic crisis of the Third Republic, and it functions as a form of resistance to cultural assimilation. Moreover, because defilement is at once material and symbolic and because that "symbolism" is an obstinately obscure mode of referentiality, Mallarmé's cultivation of defilement is a recuperation of the scapegoats that "pure" philosophy necessarily exiles: the material and the hyperessential.<br>

Abstract: Kalapalo warrior biographies are concerned with dialogical processes of challenge, resistance, debate, and the negotiation of meaning - with the struggles that take place as people try to understand and experience anew. Although warriors were trained to aggressively defend their communities against enemies, these narratives describe how they attempted to refashion ideological forms connected with ethnic allegiance and moral community. The personalities of warriors, closely connected to the training they underwent in adolescence, are particularly important in this regard. While biographies are often understood as texts in which history is merely a context surrounding the progress of individuals, descriptions of personal development are shown here to constitute testimony about historical processes themselves, in this case the experiences of refugees fleeing from centers of European expansion in lowland South America.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>

Abstract: One poem, “After Shakespeare,” sounds particularly Shakespearean: it is the only poem in the set that draws exclusively from the Bard's lexical fields (“disloyal moon!”), so that its echoes emphasize the distance between the other sonnagrams and Shakespeare:
         
               
            For lovers oft from thee great boldness draw
               To do like acts of mutiny below;
               A tacit metamorphosis of law
               Informs their fervent antidote to woe
            
               Leftover letters are one of the hazards of the anagram machine. Mohammad explains, “Each Sonnagram, including its title, is an anagram of a standard modern-spelling version of one of Shakespeare's Sonnets, containing exactly the same letters in the same distribution as the original. The title is composed last, using whatever letters are left over once I've assembled a working sonnet in iambic pentameter with an English rhyme scheme.”(RP and F with WS [RP];
               [RP] PP with WH [VD]).
               ———
               [Sonnet 37 (“As a decrepit father takes delight”)]
            
                     
               138
                  
               Some have read the leftover letters in the concluding couplet as presenting a false encryption for the reader, linking it to Shakespeare's mysterious dedication of his sonnets in 1609 to “Mr. WH.”139
            
               The initials are also familiar to readers of modernist poetry: WS might stand in for William Shakespeare, but it might also refer to Wallace Stevens, just as WH are Auden's famous initials … But perhaps it is merely a trap to believe that decoding is possible. The point of the poem may be that knowledge of the canon, or intertextual expertise, leads only to dead ends. But if the leftover letters that stud the poem are read as recombinatory elements that follow the logic of DNA sequencing—so that language itself is a constant reproduction of combinatory possibility—the poem offer~<br>

Abstract: Little engaged with current scholarship in world literature, Apter's book is equally selective in its reference to translation studies. Derrida's work in this area is certainly important, and there is no reason why a problem-centered book would need to survey the full range of translation theory, but Apter neglects major figures whose work could enrich her argument at many points. A broader view of the politics of untranslatability, for example, could supplement Derrida's brief essay “Des tours de Babel” with the hermeneutic theory of George Steiner's
      After Babel(Oxford, 1975). Only cited for a comment on Eleanor Marx's Flaubert translation (283), Steiner could have provided valuable insights on the resistance of language to translation, which he sees as stemming from cultures' desire to protect their “alternities” from outside eyes. At least Steiner gets a passing glance. Apart from a string citation in a single footnote (4),Against World Literaturenowhere discusses or even mentions such seminal figures in the “cultural turn” of contemporary translation studies as Susan Bassnett, André Lefevere, Gideon Toury, Harish Trivedi, or Lawrence Venuti, even though from the 1980s onward these theorists revolutionized a previously formalist field to address issues of power, inequality, and the thorniness of language.<br>

Abstract: There were pockets of resistance, however, including two departments represented on this panel, Northwestern and Yale, and these provided much of the impetus for founding a new society named after phenomenology and existentialism. It was an act of rebellion, and if analytic philosophers thought of themselves as revolutionaries, the founders of SPEP were anything but counterrevolutionaries or reactionaries. They had their own revolution to foment.<br>

Abstract: But consider the referents when I say, “Come here, I want to show you a gorilla,” “Come here, I want to show you a human being,” “Here look at this beautiful woman,” “Look at this hunk of a man,” and so forth, all of which feature properties. Now consider a quite different display: “Come here, I want to show you a person.” What are we here looking for? How does it differ from an individual human being? Granted that we in fact use
            personas synonymous withhuman being, are we here merely displaying an individual human being or instance of the kind called “human”? Consider the resistance in saying, “Come here, I want to show you a Barak Obama.” We might, of course, have in mind a political style or character and thus refer to a constellation of properties. But we would not be referring to the person, Barak Obama, certainly not to what he refers to when he says “I,” but, for example, to a type, a certain sort of politician.

Abstract: A second strategy is Grosz's desubjectivation of memory: “Matter and life are thus not opposites, binary pairs (plus or minus vital force), but intimately implicated in each other, different degrees of one and the same force. Life is matter extended into the virtual; matter is life compressed into dormancy. Life erupts from (and transforms) the material conditions that enable matter to ‘remember’” (2011, 20). Focusing on memory as material event, I place Grosz's work alongside that of Paul Cilliers, author of the 1998 book
         Complexity and Postmodernism. Cilliers defines “memory” as a “physical condition of the brain: which pathways are breached (‘facilitated’) and which are not. Memory is not a cognitive function performed by a conscious subject, but an unconscious characteristic of the brain (which is an organ, part of the body). Memory is the substrate that sets up the conditions for all the functions of the brain” (1998, 45–46). Memory is a distributed pattern of valences across a complex system. It is an essential aspect of complex systems open to their environments, Cilliers maintains, because it offers resistance to environmental changes. Repeated patterns of distribution strengthen the connectedness of various nodes or elements involved in a given systemic pattern; repetition intensifies some networks at the expense of others. Without these transformations, an open system would simply mirror its environment (Cilliers1998, 92). However, such systems do not simply project immediate environmental inputs or conditions. Rather, in some configurations, matter retains or repeats patterns resulting from past stimulation; in some configurations, matterremembers. When it does, it differs from its environment while remaining fully within the impact and draw of whatever surrounds it. This differing is what enables a material system to organize itself, differing further from but responding constantly to its environment. Memory is not representation; Cilliers write~<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: If a utopian prospect for architecture and the city, which means for us as citizens as well, continues to exist, its traces will be found in the already existing city—historical and modern alike and even in the depths of the apparent dystopia of cities and citizenship deformed by capitalism, neoliberalism, and speculation. Where to look for such traces is a most pressing question. The answer is both obvious and obscure: Utopia's trace resides in the everyday life of the city and its inhabitants, especially in those mundane activities of ordinary citizens that somehow manage to remain free of the dual cancers of advertising and consumption, which deprive individuals and communities of whatever lingering agency they may have, not least by transforming each of us from citizens into shoppers. Lest the stultifying effects of the
      society of the spectacleprevail, resistance, in the form of utopian longings and projects for a more just city, must inevitably begin with the self, through a stubborn conviction that we can continue to imagine substantive alternatives together.<br>
