  CHAPTER 12  One Century of Science: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: For historians of science, one of the most distinctive features of the Society of Jesus was its dedication to science and scientific education, especially when compared with other religious orders. The Jesuits’ contributions to early modern science have been studied extensively and are now widely known, lending further credence to George Sarton’s (1884–1956) dictum that “one cannot study the history of mathematics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries without coming across Jesuits at every corner.”¹ Fifty years later, in his book on the history of electricity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, John Heilbron (1934–) echoed this assertion<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Actions of This Kind or That from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt18kcvc1">Enigmas of Sacrifice</a><br>
  Abstract: The fin de siècle witnessed a turbulent confluence of literary and philosophical energies, a clash of scientific and irrational preoccupations in which William Shakespeare featured on either side. Oscar Wilde’s “Portrait of Mr W. H.” (1889) set out to endanger the distinction between science and the irrational and, in acknowledgment, the most recent
                  Complete Workspersists in classifying it as fiction.¹ The scholars were at work with important publications coming from E. K. Chambers, Sidney Lee, C. F. Onions, Arthur Pollard, and others in the decade or so following. Some of this was taken to be dryas-dust, for example Pollard’s<br>

  Mimetic Theory’s Post-Kantian Legacy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last few years, religion has increasingly become a subject of dispute. Two positions seem to be the most popular. On the one hand, outspoken atheists reject religion in the name of reason and science. On the other hand, we witness an increase in scholarship sympathetic with conservative Christian movements. In this chapter, I will use the term “new atheists” to refer to the former approach, and the term “new theists” to refer to the latter approach.<br>

  Nationalism and Realist Discourses of International Relations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Lapid Yosef<br>
  Abstract: In the post-Cold War era, nationalism has finally come to be recognized as probably the most explosive political force of our century. However, this belated recognition—forced upon us by dramatic historical events such as the implosion of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia—in no way eliminates the need to reexamine the reasons behind the sustained failure of most Western social sciences to generate serious theoretical interest in a foremost historical phenomenon.² For the neglect-of-nationalism-problem has resulted in “the most striking example of a general failure among experts to anticipate social developments.”³<br>

  The Gender of Rhetoric, Reason, and Realism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Peterson V. Spike<br>
  Abstract: This chapter argues that moving beyond realism—to post-realism—requires moving beyond the gender-blindness of conventional accounts.¹ My argument weaves together areas of inquiry that are usually treated in isolation. Intellectual developments associated with the rise of systematic inquiry in ancient Greece—marked by the shift from rhetoric to philosophy and its foundational dichotomies of reason over affect, mind over body—comprise one area of inquiry. Another is the study of historical-political developments—the shift to centralized authority and its dichotomies of public over private, civilized over “other”—within which Western science and political theory “emerged.” A third area of<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Detour and Sacrifice: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt8fr">For René Girard</a><br>
  Author(s) Dupuy Jean-Pierre<br>
  Abstract: I first came across René Girard’s work in 1975. The director of the influential journal Esprit, Jean-Marie Domenach, urged me that year to read
                  La violence et le sacré.¹ That book represented in his opinion a major breakthrough in the social sciences, and Esprit was playing a major role in publicizing it. I read it reluctantly, as I was at the time still under the spell of the thinking of Ivan Illich, a major social critic with whom I had just collaborated in the writing of his bookMedical Nemesis.² I was impressed but not especially moved by my reading<br>

                  wa jaʿalnā min al-māʾi kulla shayʾ in ḥayyin,21:30); it is implicit in Genesis I, where the earth and the heavens are created by a division of the waters; it forms a basic truth claim in modern astronomical science, so that the mere presence of water on a planet may be a sign of life; it is found in many creation myths and much common sense. Thales, who launched the great adventure of Greek philosophy, also affirmed as much. There is<br>

  Abstract: What was The New Musicology? I use the past tense because the conceptual transformation that overtook musical scholarship during the 1990s had become more or less normative by the time the decade ended. The process unfolded almost too neatly along the classic lines described in Thomas Kuhn’s
                  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions:a set of established conceptual protocols underwent a rapid collapse, others that would once have been dismissed as untenable replaced them, and then, after a period of ferment and controversy, the emergent protocols crystallized, perhaps with a certain loss of energy, into a new “normal science.” By 2002<br>

  Book Title: Subjectivity-Ethnographic Investigations<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): KLEINMAN ARTHUR<br>
  Abstract: This innovative volume is an extended intellectual conversation about the ways personal lives are being undone and remade today. Examining the ethnography of the modern subject, this preeminent group of scholars probes the continuity and diversity of modes of personhood across a range of Western and non-Western societies. Contributors consider what happens to individual subjectivity when stable or imagined environments such as nations and communities are transformed or displaced by free trade economics, terrorism, and war; how new information and medical technologies reshape the relation one has to oneself; and which forms of subjectivity and life possibilities are produced against a world in pieces. The transdisciplinary conversation includes anthropologists, historians of science, psychologists, a literary critic, a philosopher, physicians, and an economist. The authors touch on how we think and write about contingency, human agency, and ethics today.<br>

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

  Abstract: We have come a long way since Bury informed us so firmly that history is a science, no more and no less. Historiography has now become so various and eclectic that it is often difficult to see it as the expression of any specific discipline; historians today seem to be united only by some common concern with the past and by a common allegiance, at least in principle, to respect for evidence, the exercise of critical intelligence, and openness of mind. They differ, on the whole amicably, about the questions they ask; and in answering these questions they draw freely<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pphf4">Being There</a><br>
  Author(s) Hammoudi Abdellah<br>
  Abstract: American anthropology opened up a Pandora’s box the moment it specified culture as its object, simultaneously setting itself at a distance from the natural sciences and defining itself in contradistinction to both American cognitivism and French structuralism. By the 1980s, the discipline was engaged in a soul-searching movement to critically assess its object, its principal method, and the most current form of the write-up of research results. In 1986, two books appeared seeking to provide a focus for this wide-ranging debate:

  Book Title: Studying Global Pentecostalism-Theories and Methods<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): van der Laan Cornelis<br>
  Abstract: With its remarkable ability to adapt to many different cultures, Pentecostalism has become the world’s fastest growing religious movement. More than five hundred million adherents worldwide have reshaped Christianity itself. Yet some fundamental questions in the study of global Pentecostalism, and even in what we call “Pentecostalism,” remain largely unaddressed. Bringing together leading scholars in the social sciences, history, and theology, this unique volume explores these questions for this rapidly growing, multidisciplinary field of study. A valuable resource for anyone studying new forms of Christianity, it offers insights and guidance on both theoretical and methodological issues. The first section of the book examines such topics as definitions, essentialism, postcolonialism, gender, conversion, and globalization. The second section features contributions from those working in psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. The third section traces the boundaries of theology from the perspectives of pneumatology, ecumenical studies, inter-religious relations, and empirical theology.<br>

  Abstract: “Cultural studies” and similar designations mark a diverse field of related theoretical approaches, sometimes labeled “cultural turn,” that have deeply influenced the humanities and social sciences in the past three decades.¹ In general, studies on Pentecostal and Charismatic movements have not taken up these approaches in their research design, despite notable exceptions² and occasional reference in anthropological studies,³ as well as in reflections by Pentecostal and Charismatic theologians themselves.⁴ Nevertheless, it is worth taking a closer look at these approaches, because some of the pressing issues in the current research on Pentecostalism are reflected therein.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12877vs">The Making of the Humanities, vol. III</a><br>
  Author(s) Weststeijn Thijs<br>
  Abstract: With this third volume of our three-part project on the history of the humanities we have arrived at the modern age. This is the period of discipline formation and academic institutionalization, but it is also the period when the humanities and sciences drew farther apart. While already foreshadowed by Giambattista Vico’s famous eighteenth-century distinction between the ‘science of the human’ and ‘science of the natural’, Wilhelm Dilthey’s distinction between
                  GeisteswissenschaftandNaturwissenschaftwas very influential.¹ That is, the humanities are deemed to be predicated on understanding (Verstehen), the sciences on explaining (Erklären). The distinction was adopted by philosophers such as<br>

  Author(s) Daston Lorraine<br>
  Abstract: For over a century, the relationships between the humanities and the sciences have been largely defined by opposition:
                  Geistes- versusNaturwissenschaften, ideographic versus nomothetic, interpretative versus explanatory, past- versus future-oriented. These oppositions were hammered out in theFestredenof Dilthey, Windelband, Helmholtz, and other leading lights of bellwether German universities and reflected the rising prestige and power of the natural sciences in the final quarter of the nineteenth century. Since then, the history and philosophy of science in most European traditions has been dominated by inquiries into the natural sciences: a comparable history of the humanities is just beginning to<br>

  Abstract: When scientists in our day meddle with the humanities, the outcomes are not always uplifting. Sometimes they are, as when art historians and chemists supplement each other’s expertise quite nicely in establishing or disproving the authenticity of some famous painting. In my own discipline, the history of science, the contributions scientists make are rarely so productive, unless (as, for instance, with Thomas Kuhn) they turn themselves into professional historians. Professional scientists with a layman’s interest in history certainly tend to display a deep-seated emotional involvement in past manifestations of their own present-day concerns. But the flip side of their praiseworthy<br>

  Author(s) Meneghello Laura<br>
  Abstract: Positivism is normally understood as favoring separation of the humanities and the natural sciences, rather than interaction between them. This is because, around the 1850s, the modern scientific method seemed to provoke a progressive demarcation between the exact sciences and other disciplines. I would like to question this assumption by analyzing the attitude of Jacob Moleschott’s scientific materialism – which has typically been interpreted as one of the most radical movements within Positivism – vis-à-vis the humanities.<br>

  Abstract: In the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences in which I work, the philosophers have no doubt that they are part of the humanities.

  Author(s) Mersmann Birgit<br>
  Abstract: Within the realm of modernizing the humanities, the aspiration of art history to transform into a universal discipline and modern science manifests itself as a cultural, anthropological, and spatial orientation toward world art and universal history. The ground for this modern shift was prepared by the universalization of art as based on the concept of mutual cultural influences and historical transfers. At the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, art history joined forces with subbranches of history such as universal history and cultural history. Through these interdisciplinary linkages, it also opened to a new self-definition and revaluation as<br>

  Abstract: The sciences and the humanities have a long tradition of cultural crossings and reciprocal influences; this interwoven history, however, has been first somehow minimized and downplayed during the nineteenth century, and then simply slipped into a far corner of our memories – feeding on contemporary hyperspecialization and high disciplinary boundaries – until recent scholarly work evidenced how our narrow contemporary perspective was compromising a thorough understanding of the modern era. Positivism and the professionalization of academic disciplines brought about a very critical attitude toward the intellectual syncretism of the foregoing centuries.

  Author(s) Romeijn Jan-Willem<br>
  Abstract: In comparison to the natural and social sciences, the humanities have received comparatively little attention from the analytic philosophy of science. This discipline has been concerned primarily with the sciences narrowly construed. In particular confirmation theory, the systematic study of theory evaluation, shows remarkable lacunas when it comes to the methodology of the humanities. But developments in the humanities and in conformation theory invite us to reconsider this situation. First, due to the fast uptake of empirical and computational methods in several humanities disciplines, the humanities are presently very much in flux, and much more amenable to methodological elucidation.

  Abstract: During the nineteenth century we witness an extraordinary progress and increasing specialization in the natural sciences as well as the growth and professionalization of universities in Germany.¹ At the same time, after the deaths of Goethe and Hegel, the epoch of Romanticism and German Idealism had come to an end.² While the sciences diversified and emancipated from their philosophical past, philosophy itself fragmented into competing schools and currents,³ and in many respects, precipitated into an existential crisis.⁴ For a long time in the mainstream historiography of philosophy the nineteenth century was considered to harbor only epigones or predecessors.⁵ However, there<br>

  Abstract: With a frequency that is quite remarkable, contemporary political theorists in the Anglophone world continue to speak of the Weimar Republic as a decisive point of origin for their field of inquiry. Of course, the field has many sources (some modern, some ancient), but ‘the Weimar origins of political theory’ is a key topos. Thus, in 1988, John Gunnell, perhaps the most relentless scholar on this issue, could write that ‘the contemporary estrangement of political theory from political science is in large measure the product of a quarrel that originated in the challenge to the values of US political science<br>

  Abstract: Sociology and its companion social sciences, such as cultural anthropology and psychology, enjoy ambivalent relations with one another, and with sections of the humanities, from cultural history to the study of languages. To complicate matters more, the relations with the natural sciences are ambiguous as well and subject to debate. Intellectuals never created a clear-cut and generally accepted classification of the arts and sciences concerned with human behavior. The cognitive quality of literature and the visual arts never disappeared. Literary authors still claim to enlighten

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: Plato marked a turning point in the appreciation of language by philosophers. In the
                  Cratylus, he shows that words are thoroughly conventional. Those who coin them do so with only a superficial understanding of the things spoken about. Accordingly, philosophical knowledge comes from inquiring into the natures of things rather than from learning to speak. Despite discovering the conventionality of language, Plato still accords speech a crucial role. Insight into the nature of things occurs by means of a conversation carried out with conventional terms: “For this knowledge is not something that can be put into words like other sciences;<br>

  Abstract: Woody Allen joked that he was expelled from college because he cheated on a metaphysics exam: “I looked into the soul of the boy sitting next to me.”² In this book, I have followed the mainstream position of Western philosophy and science that literal mind reading or a “sixth sense” is not a natural human endowment. Instead, animate movement effectively enables our minds to commune so that we can subsequently share the world in speech. In this chapter on metaphysics, I wish to clarify conceptually the resources involved in sharing the world.<br>

  Book Title: God--The World's Future-Systematic Theology for a New Era<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: God—The World’s Future has been a proven and comprehensive textbook in systematic theology for over twenty years. Explicitly crafted to address our postmodern context, Peters explains the whole body of Christian historical doctrine from within a “proleptic” framework, “whereby the gospel is understood as announcing the pre-actualization of the future consummation of all things in Jesus Christ.” Peters skillfully deploys this concept not only to organize the various theological areas or loci but also to rethink doctrines in light of key postmodern challenges from ecumenism, critical historical thinking, contemporary science, and gender and sexuality issues. The Third Edition is thoroughly revised with updated chapters, additional chapters, updated annotations and bibliographies, and further elaborations in light of recent developments in method and theological reflection. This classic text opens up systematic theology in new dimensions, retrieving traditional categories and topics for a new generation of students and learners to give a fresh reading of Christian theology and articulation of the liberating message of the gospel of God’s grace for the future of the world.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzvt6">The Catholic Studies Reader</a><br>
  Author(s) HOANG LINH<br>
  Abstract: A standard narrative of American religious history has relied on the Puritan sense of a common purpose. John Winthrop’s famous “City on a Hill” speech to the Pilgrims is emblematic of this. This narrative of election and purpose has shaped the way other religions have been measured. But in doing so it has neglected the voice of religious dissenters and the significance of racial diversity within the ranks of American Christians. Likewise, social science and historical studies of immigrants and refugees tend to gloss over religious affiliation and focus mainly on adaptation or assimilation processes into American culture. Both religious<br>

  Book Title: Bruno Latour in Pieces: An Intellectual Biography-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Custance Gloria<br>
  Abstract: Bruno Latour stirs things up. Latour began as a lover of science and technology, co-founder of actor-network theory, and philosopher of a modernity that had "never been modern." In the meantime he is regarded not just as one of the most intelligent and also popular exponents of science studies but also as a major innovator of the social sciences, an exemplary wanderer who walks the line between the sciences and the humanities. This book provides the first comprehensive overview of the Latourian oeuvre, from his early anthropological studies in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), to influential books like Laboratory Life and Science in Action, and his most recent reflections on an empirical metaphysics of "modes of existence." In the course of this enquiry it becomes clear that the basic problem to which Latour's work responds is that of social tradition, the transmission of experience and knowledge. What this empirical philosopher constantly grapples with is the complex relationship of knowledge, time, and culture.<br>

  Abstract: Latour’s conviction that Pasteur and his allies had “redefined the social link” was clearly the result of his focused analysis of late nineteenth-century biological and medical journals. Yet one can also read this statement as the consequence of a conscious decision with political undertones. Or at least this has been suggested by the British science historian Simon Schaffer in a review essay of

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Author(s) Davies Oliver<br>
  Abstract: Change in science involves a change in the way we understand materiality and the world around us. Since we ourselves are material as well as mind, what we

More than that, the introduction of the new science into our own embodied space, through new technologies, can even change our “contact” with the world: how we are in the world as self-aware creatures who are both mind and body at the same time.

  Abstract: The nature of humanity, our relationship with each other, and our relationship with the sacred is the starting point for reflections on theological anthropology.

  Abstract: The name of Hegel is a mighty invocation for philosophy. A model of rigor, and from start to finish grounded in
                  Wissenschaft(science), Hegel’s philosophy has infiltrated far corners of the globe. Although often disputed, Hegel’s judgments are not easily dismissed. Nonetheless, as Paul de Man astutely observed about Hegel’s influence, “Few thinkers have so many disciples who never read a word of their master’s writings” (“Sign and Symbol” 93).³ Early in his career, Karl Marx expressed a similar sentiment with regard to the Young Hegelians of his time.

  Abstract: The rise of religious fundamentalism in the closing decades of the twentieth century continues to have enormous repercussions not only for politics, but also for the disciplines of the human sciences, philosophy, and theology. The sociology of religion, perhaps the paradigmatic achievement of the discipline of sociology, has been dealing with the effects of the crisis of its theories of secularization. The so-called deprivatization of religion has forced on the table the old-age question of the relation between God and society, or faith and the constitution of community, with the added complication that the community at stake nowadays is a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x03hs">Saintly Influence: Edith Wyschogrod and the Possibilities of Philosophy of Religion</a><br>
  Author(s) KELBER WERNER H.<br>
  Abstract: Three interrelated features may be said to characterize the work of Edith Wyschogrod. There is first an interdisciplinary drive to rise above institutionally sanctioned boundaries and to retrieve intellectual categories from their disciplinary captivity so as to reconfigure them in novel contexts. It is this desire and the ability to bring widely differing genres, discourses and traditionally separate intellectual orbits into productive coalitions that have increasingly distinguished her writings. This linking of philosophy and theology, psychoanalysis and science, literary criticism and linguistics, architecture and the arts, media studies and above all, ethics, is carried off with a high degree of<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Nature: The Emerging Field of Environmental Hermeneutics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Treanor Brian<br>
  Abstract: Modern environmentalism has come to realize that many of its key concerns "wilderness" and "nature" among them are contested territory, viewed differently by different people. Understanding nature requires science and ecology, to be sure, but it also requires a sensitivity tom, history, culture, and narrative. Thus, understanding nature is a fundamentally hermeneutic task.<br>

  Abstract: Bernard Lonergan, who lived from 1904 to 1984, would have been delighted to become aware of the scientific discoveries that have occurred in our times. He remains a favorite mentor of mine, and when I indulge my amateur’s interest in science I turn to him, not because he was a scientist, but because he gives me a way of looking at these new realities with a worldview that makes room for them, however unexpected or disconcerting they might be.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x05fq">God's Mirror: Renewal and Engagement in French Catholic Intellectual Culture in the Mid-Twentieth Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Sudlow Brian<br>
  Abstract: Since the 1990s there has been a broad critical consensus that the polemical writings of Georges Bernanos are paradoxically modern in substance and style. In his essay on
                  Les grands cimetières sous la lune(A Diary of My Times, 1938), Bernanos’s tract about the Spanish Civil War, Michel Estève underlines how Bernanos’s dissent from the textbook Catholic response to the war was evidence of his affirming the primacy of conscience over ideology.¹ Pierrette Renard has mounted the most complex and detailed argument in the secondary literature to demonstrate how Bernanos, in his polemical writings, was a modern in spite of<br>

  THE BOOK OF RUTH AS COMEDY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0610">Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs</a><br>
  Author(s) Aschkenasy Nehama<br>
  Abstract: More than any other biblical story or cycle of tales, the book of Ruth belongs to the dramatic genre. Structured as a series of short, eventful scenes animated by spirited, dynamic dialogue, it can be easily adapted for the stage. The conversation in the book of Ruth is either between two protagonists or between a protagonist and “chorus” (in the form of the women of Bethlehem, or the workers in the field, or the elders at the gate), but there are usually no more than two principal interlocutors in any given scene. The story’s narrator possesses only limited omniscience, offering<br>

  Author(s) Davis Ellen F.<br>
  Abstract: Among the most important questions for biblical interpreters to ask is the question of genre:
                     As whatare we to read this text? In the modern period, it was Hermann Gunkel who brought that question to the fore. As he demonstrated, the issue confronts us as soon as the opening pages of Genesis.¹ Do we read this as history (cum science) or as myth, as something that happened at a certain time—history, or as (citing the description of myth offered by the Roman historian Sallust) “something that happens over and over again”?<br>

  Abstract: The history of our time is a history of change, really of revolutionary change. Revolutions in the sciences, in weaponry, in international relations, in agriculture, in cooking, in relations between men and women, in gender identity, in child rearing. The essential measures of our earthly existence, time and space, we understand in far more complex ways that we did even twenty years ago.

  Abstract: With advances in technoscience, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish nature from culture, the grown from the made. Geneticists can enhance the DNA of almost any living creature, including human beings. Cloning is a reality, no longer just the stuff of science fiction. New genetic engineering and organ transplantation technologies raise legal questions about the ownership of one’s own DNA and one’s own body. Who has the right to reproduce certain DNA, particularly if some DNA (disease resistant) is more desirable than other DNA (disease prone)? In laboratories, we can reproduce most things living and dead. Technologies of reproduction of<br>

  Book Title: Thinking Through the Imagination: Aesthetics in Human Cognition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: Use your imagination! The demand is as important as it is confusing. What is the imagination? What is its value? Where does it come from? And where is it going in a time when even the obscene seems overdone and passe? This book takes up these questions and argues for the centrality of imagination in human cognition. It traces the development of the imagination in Kant's critical philosophy (particularly the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment) and claims that the insights of Kantian aesthetic theory, especially concerning the nature of creativity, common sense, and genius, influenced the development of nineteenth-century American philosophy. The book identifies the central role of the imagination in the philosophy of Peirce, a role often overlooked in analytic treatments of his thought. The final chapters pursue the observation made by Kant and Peirce that imaginative genius is a type of natural gift (ingenium) and must in some way be continuous with the creative force of nature. It makes this final turn by way of contemporary studies of metaphor, embodied cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.<br>

  Abstract: As we turn our attention to the explanations of the imagination furnished by the contemporary empirical sciences, it is wise to remember the Sphinx.¹ When Peirce wrote “A Guess at the Riddle,” he asked that a small vignette of the Sphinx be placed under the title. But why? I suspect Emerson (the author of “The Sphinx” in 1841) and Thoreau (a commentator on this favorite poem of Emerson) had a pretty good idea. Once again, “A Guess at the Riddle” was Peirce’s rough outline of the way that triadic relations obtained first in metaphysics and psychology and then in the<br>

  Abstract: In many ways Chinese and Western philosophy offer a series of vivid contrasts going all the way back to their respective origins, so that the very idea of philosophy itself stands in contrast. The West begins with the Greeks and their speculative wonder at nature. The original question for them is: What is the originating principle of nature? This prefigures the central concern of Western philosophy with knowledge and science. The origin of Chinese philosophy focuses upon fundamental questions of political and ethical philosophy. The original question for them is, How can we discovery the Way? These two different origins<br>

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

  Abstract: Around 1900, following Julius Robert Mayer’s research on the laws of thermodynamics and his later discovery of processes of ignition, the German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald developed a general theory of
                  energetics. It broadened and expanded the first two laws of thermodynamics, which state the conservation of energy and the general tendency toward entropy, beyond the realm of physics, mechanics, and chemistry to the life sciences and even the social sciences and the humanities, as the title “The Energetic Foundations of Cultural Studies” (Die energetischen Grundlagen der Kulturwissenschaft) from 1909 suggests.¹ Ostwald introduces a “classification of pure sciences”² that differentiates between<br>

  Book Title: Value and Values-Economics and Justice in an Age of Global Interdependence<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: Especially in the aftermath of what is now being called the Great Recession, awareness has mounted of the imperative to question the modern divorce of economics from ethics. While the domains of economics and ethics were from antiquity through at least the eighteenth century understood in many cultures to be coterminous and mutually entailing, the modern assumption has been that the goal of maximizing human prosperity and the aim of justly enhancing our lives as persons and as communities were functionally and practically distinct. Working from a wide array of perspectives, the contributors to this volume offer a set of challenges to the assumed independence of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of human and planetary well-being. Reflecting on the complex interrelationship among economics, justice, and equity, the book resists "one size fits all" approaches and struggles to revitalize the marriage of economics and ethics by activating cultural differences as the basis of mutual contribution to shared human flourishing. The publication of this important collection will stimulate or extend critical debates among scholars and students working in a number of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including philosophy, history, environmental studies, economics, and law.<br>

The increasingly large number of elderly people has caused various problems to the political and economic systems of societies, including family structure, ethical relationships, lifestyles, and values, as well as to the emotional state of their members. Neither the spontaneous capitalistic market nor a state welfare system can easily resolve these issues. In a modern market economy ruled by the logic of capital and profit, elderly people, who, usually unemployed, are considered mere consumers, thus present a<br>

Is it competitive, or is it cooperative? Acquisitive or sharing? Egoistic or altruistic? Indeed, it was out of this debate and a desire to settle empirically once and for all what had largely been a battle of opposing, merely speculative assertions that the science of cultural anthropology in large measure was born.<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa.

  5  U.S. Constitutionalism or Marketplace Society? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bsxmk">Hegemony</a><br>
  Abstract: The uniqueness of the United States is often attributed to the structure of its political organization rather than to its political economy. As the first fully modern polity built from scratch, with reference to classical and early modern political theories of republicanism and liberalism, the United States has often been presented as a constitutional model for the world at large. The strand of American political thought associated most closely with President Woodrow Wilson—arguably the founder of modern American political science and the prophet of American global institutionalism—lends itself to world politics not only as a model for emulation<br>

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This work takes a much-needed stand in the inter-disciplinary field of philosophical anthropology. Sheets-Johnstone is well-read in the history of philosophy and in contemporary anthropology. The point of view she offers is inventive, insightful, well-established, and fruitful." --Thomas M.

  Abstract: THE PROJECT of connecting philosophical concepts in the Philosophy for Children curriculum with the concepts in academic philosophy from which they were derived (or that they resemble) can be of considerable value for teachers and scholars wishing to ascertain the grounds of the curriculum in the philosophical tradition. We should not, however, restrict such an inquiry to philosophical concepts and the history of philosophy. A parallel enterprise might seek to show how the skills of logic have been employed at key points in any history (whether of philosophy, of science, of technology, or of the humanities) so as to provide<br>

Does his writing and visual art aspire to represent the innovative and the imminent, that is, to forge new ideas in a seemingly exhausted, derivative era? His novels occupy a perplexing hinterland between Tyler Johnson’s irrepressible optimism ‘about the future’ and the everyday, apocalyptic paranoia expressed in
                  JPod,the writer’s most playfully surreal, exuberantly decadent and morally unsettling piece of fiction to date. This conclusion will use Coupland’s highly self-conscious tenth ‘novel’ – though absurdist science-project or anti-art manifesto might be more appropriate terms of<br>

If nature can no longer be said to have a theological basis, what determines how we are to understand what nature is? Kant’s ambivalence with regard to ‘nature’ suggest why this issue creates so much controversy. On the one hand, nature ‘in the formal sense’ is simply that which functions in terms of necessary laws, and is therefore the object of natural science; on the other, in the form of organisms and as an object of beauty, nature appears to have purposes which cannot be<br>

The familiar ghost of philosophical history, in which the scholar’s task is both to identify the ‘real’ mechanisms underlying historical development and to intervene, or enable intervention, positively in relation to time – to workwithoragainsttime – continued to be present. One of the reasons why post-Popperian social science ostensibly rejected historicism was because it was argued that historicism was normatively driven and incapable<br>

In all cases, it was clear that predominant voices in the social science of international politics, in post-Kantian theories of cosmopolitan democracy and in post-Marxist accounts of ‘empire’ and ‘multitude’ relied upon accounts of the relation betweenchronosandkairosthat echoed arguments previously encountered in Chapter 2.

  Abstract: Amnesia is a kind of immobility. To obliterate connections between past and present is to preclude the possibility of movement or change in the future, to condemn oneself to the anaesthetised drudgery of the endless present. It is appropriate, then, that Jonathan Lethem so often employs spatial metaphors in his interrogations of the condition of American amnesia. In
                  Amnesia Moon(1995), which collides the road narrative with dystopian science fiction, the road performs this metaphorical function. Mikhail Bakhtin cites the road as an example of a literary chronotope, something he defines as ‘the primary means for materializing time in space<br>

En elle-même, cette conscience est libre. Les maints tableaux des contraintes physiques, psychologiques ou politiques qu’offre cependant l’Histoire, la crainte qu’inspirent ces supplices, peuvent induire à la soumission de la conscience, limiter son champ d’action, la détruire. La conscience est donc libre, ou elle n’est pas. C’est la raison pour laquelle, dans les États démocratiques, tous les moyens sont développés pour protéger la liberté de conscience des citoyens.

The vicissitudes of the late Middle Ages (especially with the rediscovery of Aristotle and the work of Thomas Aquinas) and then of modernity have shown the importance of the rational, moral conscience—its autonomous ability to construct an ethical form. Theological thought, likewise, has been able to recognize that revelation does not substitute for but rather conserves moral autonomy, which, thus recognized,<br>

  Abstract: During the nineteenth century, the will to make an inventory of all that nature had placed at the disposition of humankind resulted in the invention of “cabinets of curiosity,” collections more exhaustive than they were spectacular. From the outset, they proved essential to the task of describing, comparing, and hierarchizing nature’s elements. Later they would serve to colonize nature, its countries, and its peoples. Indeed, the first colonial conquests (in Egypt, Algeria, India, Australia, etc.) ushered in new fields of study, and reinforced the need for inventory.

  Author(s) Moura Jean-Marc<br>
  Abstract: The focus of this chapter will be provided by a consideration of a postcolonial approach to literature and its utility to French literary studies. A postcolonial methodology considers colonial influences and tropes in literary production, and works to reveal them. Let it first be noted that postcolonialism—in terms of its focus on the colonial influences and tropes in literary production—is already an important domain in the fields of literature and social sciences in Anglophone universities and in other academic institutions all over the world.

  Book Title: The Future of Continental Philosophy of Religion-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Robbins Jeffrey W.<br>
  Abstract: What is the future of Continental philosophy of religion? These forward-looking essays address the new thinkers and movements that have gained prominence since the generation of Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, and Levinas and how they will reshape Continental philosophy of religion in the years to come. They look at the ways concepts such as liberation, sovereignty, and post-colonialism have engaged this new generation with political theology and the new pathways of thought that have opened in the wake of speculative realism and recent findings in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. Readers will discover new directions in this challenging and important area of philosophical inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: It was a bright June day in Fes, with perfect blue skies, just before the heat of summer would lie on the Ville Nouvelle¹ like an unquiet conscience. Today my Moroccan mother-in-law, Jamila, had been promising to take me to the tomb of Sidi Bou Ghalib in the medina.

  Book Title: Phenomenology in Anthropology-A Sense of Perspective<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): JACKSON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: This volume explores what phenomenology adds to the enterprise of anthropology, drawing on and contributing to a burgeoning field of social science research inspired by the phenomenological tradition in philosophy. Essays by leading scholars ground their discussions of theory and method in richly detailed ethnographic case studies. The contributors broaden the application of phenomenology in anthropology beyond the areas in which it has been most influential-studies of sensory perception, emotion, bodiliness, and intersubjectivity-into new areas of inquiry such as martial arts, sports, dance, music, and political discourse.<br>

Unlike macro-social science with its illuminating focus on political economic structures that mediate personal history and condition social experience, potentially making the stories of 15 million people variations on a theme, fiction gives attentive value to the particular, the quixotic, and the perverse.

It is to raise consciousness, where it seems to me to need raising, to conscience, and to raise conscience, where it seems to me to need raising, to responsibility.

  2  The Event of Truth from:

  Abstract: What does
                     Truth and Methodmean? The significance of the conjunction “and” has almost turned this title into an enigma. If “method” has a negative value in the title, then the “and” does not connect, but rather represents an alternative. The title could be revised accordingly asTruth or Method.¹ In an even more radical version, one could think of the formulation:Truth against Method.² If “method” is taken as a model and metaphor for the natural sciences, then truth occursoutsidemethod. Thus it is possible to speak of “extramethodical” experiences of truth.<br>

  Abstract: It may seem surprising—and Gadamer himself admits this in retrospect—that
                  Truth and Method,despite the title’s promise of a close examination of truth, begins with an extensive discussion of art (GR195/GW8373). However, art in particular plays a key role in philosophical hermeneutics, and this is because a new experience of truth can be achieved only from art; thus the need arises to free aesthetics from the quarrel with modern science. The modern scientific demand for objectivity forces aesthetic experience to understand itself merely subjectively, as if we were dealing with a form of subjectivity that is<br>

  Abstract: Taken as a whole, George A. Romero’s body of work has most often been thought to mark shifts in cultural anxieties—anxieties around the Vietnam War and the civil rights era, the rise of a consumer economy, the relation of science and the military during the Cold War, the war in Iraq, and the irruptive spectacle of terrorism—anxieties that his films not only embody but also critically respond to, and all of which have been well documented.

  Book Title: Material Feminisms-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: Harnessing the energy of provocative theories generated by recent understandings of the human body, the natural world, and the material world, Material Feminisms presents an entirely new way for feminists to conceive of the question of materiality. In lively and timely essays, an international group of feminist thinkers challenges the assumptions and norms that have previously defined studies about the body. These wide-ranging essays grapple with topics such as the material reality of race, the significance of sexual difference, the impact of disability experience, and the complex interaction between nature and culture in traumatic events such as Hurricane Katrina. By insisting on the importance of materiality, this volume breaks new ground in philosophy, feminist theory, cultural studies, science studies, and other fields where the body and nature collide.<br>

  1  DARWIN AND FEMINISM: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzgqh">Material Feminisms</a><br>
  Author(s) Grosz Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: There has traditionally been a strong resistance on the part of feminists to any recourse to the question of nature. Within feminist scholarship and politics, nature has been regarded primarily as a kind of obstacle against which we need to struggle, as that which remains inert, given, unchanging, and resistant to historical, social, and cultural transformations.¹ The suspicion with which biological accounts of human and social life are treated by feminists, especially feminists not trained in the biological sciences, is to some extent understandable. “Biology” not only designates the

  Author(s) Kirby Vicki<br>
  Abstract: The “linguistic turn” in postmodern and poststructural criticism has had a major impact on the landscape of the humanities and social sciences and the way we conceive and communicate our various concerns. Words such as “text,” “writing,” “inscription,” “discourse,” “language,” “code,” “representation,” and so on are now part of the vernacular in critical discussion. Indeed, over the years the textualizing of objects and methodologies has generated new interdisciplinary formations across the academy and transformed the content, approach, and even the justifications for research. On the political front we have seen similar shifts in the practices, modes of argumentation, and even<br>

  Book Title: Levinas and the Crisis of Humanism-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): KATZ CLAIRE ELISE<br>
  Abstract: Reexamining Emmanuel Levinas's essays on Jewish education, Claire Elise Katz provides new insights into the importance of education and its potential to transform a democratic society, for Levinas's larger philosophical project. Katz examines Levinas's "Crisis of Humanism," which motivated his effort to describe a new ethical subject. Taking into account his multiple influences on social science and the humanities, and his various identities as a Jewish thinker, philosopher, and educator, Katz delves deeply into Levinas's works to understand the grounding of this ethical subject.<br>

  Abstract: The conception of physical reality within the framework of ecological postmodern thought and the nature of the material world described by quantum theory have recently been given new life by the emergence of the new materialist paradigm. The radical revisions of our ideas about the description of physical entities, chemical and biological processes, and their ethical, political, and cultural implications represented in recent discourses of feminist science studies, posthumanism, and the environmental humanities have also occasioned considerable interest among ecocritics, leading to the emergence of material ecocriticism.

  Abstract: Responding to his country’s record rainfalls in the beginning of the twenty-first century, British journalist Brian Cathcart seems to bring more of it.
                  Rainmakes a dreary forecast: “It is only when things go wrong that our dim consciousness of scientific meteorology rises to the surface” (66). French sociologist of science Bruno Latour would diagnose this tendency as “blackboxing.” Focusing only on the success of a scientific or technological apparatus paradoxically renders “the joint production of actors and artifacts entirely opaque” (Hope 183).¹ When a meteorology machine runs smoothly, it produces factual climates that we can reasonably predict and accurately<br>

  Author(s) Phillips Dana<br>
  Abstract: New materialists are fond of lists. Consider, as a first example, the beginning of Myra Hird’s 2009 review essay on “material feminism”: “Trans-corporeality. Entanglement. Meeting-with. Matter. Nonhuman. Causality. Intra-action. Disclosure. Agential realism.” Each of the terms on this list names a concept central to the “emerging field” Hird is preparing to survey (329). Most of them have come to occupy an equally important position in the discourse of new materialist theory broadly speaking, which draws on material feminism but also taps additional sources, such as phenomenology and the philosophy of science, for ideas.<br>

Today, his work still resonates strongly among scholars who are studying “the material interactions of bodies and natures” (Iovino and Oppermann, “Material” 77). According to Laura Dassow Walls, who describes the impact of his journey on both the sciences and the aesthetics of the Americas in her book A Passage to Cosmos, Humboldt considered “nature” as “a planetary interactive causal network operating across<br>

Because that controversy centered on the relationship between philosophical reason and theological science. Consider three acute questions at the heart of that debate.

  Montaigne, Julian, and “Others”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt175x2ht">Democracy, Culture, Catholicism: Voices from Four Continents</a><br>
  Author(s) Posner David M.<br>
  Abstract: In his brief essay “De la liberté de conscience,”¹ Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) holds up as his hero the fourth-century Roman emperor Julian, surnamed by later (hostile) generations the Apostate. Julian (331–361/363 ce) was so labeled for having abandoned, upon becoming emperor, the Christian faith in which he was raised, and further for restoring paganism to the empire, thereby disestablishing Christianity as the empire’s official religion. This caused Saint Augustine to make of Julian one of the principal villains in his

  Book Title: Video Games Around the World-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): IWATANI TORU<br>
  Abstract: Video games have become a global industry, and their history spans dozens of national industries where foreign imports compete with domestic productions, legitimate industry contends with piracy, and national identity faces the global marketplace. This volume describes video game history and culture across every continent, with essays covering areas as disparate and far-flung as Argentina and Thailand, Hungary and Indonesia, Iran and Ireland. Most of the essays are written by natives of the countries they discuss, many of them game designers and founders of game companies, offering distinctively firsthand perspectives. Some of these national histories appear for the first time in English, and some for the first time in any language.Readers will learn, for example, about the rapid growth of mobile games in Africa; how a meat-packing company held the rights to import the Atari VCS 2600 into Mexico; and how the Indonesian MMORPG
      Nusantara Onlinereflects that country's cultural history and folklore. Every country or region's unique conditions provide the context that shapes its national industry; for example, the long history of computer science in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the problems of piracy in China, the PC Bangs of South Korea, or the Dutch industry's emphasis on serious games. As these essays demonstrate, local innovation and diversification thrive alongside productions and corporations with global aspirations.Africa • Arab World • Argentina • Australia • Austria • Brazil • Canada • China • Colombia • Czech Republic • Finland • France • Germany • Hong Kong • Hungary • India • Indonesia • Iran • Ireland • Italy • Japan • Mexico • The Netherlands • New Zealand • Peru • Poland • Portugal • Russia • Scandinavia • Singapore • South Korea • Spain • Switzerland • Thailand • Turkey • United Kingdom • United States of America • Uruguay • Venezuela<br>

  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D.

  Abstract: The late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century imperial project to define the distinctive ethnological and ‘racial’ features of the peoples of empire (as well as the various types of European) had a profound influence on the way different races, nationalities, cultures and even classes were viewed. Fundamental to this project were the supposedly empirical sciences of physical anthropology, such as physiology, phrenology and craniology.

  Book Title: Music, Analysis, Experience-New Perspectives in Musical Semiotics<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reybrouck Mark<br>
  Abstract: Transdisciplinary and intermedial analysis of the experience of music Nowadays musical semiotics no longer ignores the fundamental challenges raised by cognitive sciences, ethology, or linguistics. Creation, action and experience play an increasing role in how we understand music, a sounding structure impinging upon our body, our mind, and the world we live in. Not discarding music as a closed system, an integral experience of music demands a transdisciplinary dialogue with other domains as well. Music, Analysis, Experience brings together contributions by semioticians, performers, and scholars from cognitive sciences, philosophy, and cultural studies, and deals with these fundamental questionings. Transdisciplinary and intermedial approaches to music meet musicologically oriented contributions to classical music, pop music, South American song, opera, narratology, and philosophy.<br>

  Author(s) BARCHI FABRIZIO ARENAS<br>
  Abstract: Mestizajeis a complex and nuanced ideology. Of the notions that the social sciences treat, mestizaje is perhaps one of the more opaque—and loaded. The notion itself encompasses other ideas such as “race,” “culture,” “identity,” and “ethnicity” in fabricating its multiple applications in everyday social, political, and academic settings. These applications overlap each other, producing successive interpretations of what it may be that is being mixed in the mestizaje. These overlapping applications of mestizaje in everyday life all seem to be interwoven with the same thread: the different ways of dealing with diversity.<br>

Without doubt spurred by the visibility that Indigenous movements have achieved in settings such as southeastern Mexico, post-war Guatemala, and Ecuador during the Indigenous “uprisings” of the 1990s, and with the ascendency of Evo Morales to the presidency of Bolivia, the research agendas of anthropologists, sociologists, and political scientists have focused attention on trying to explain the “resurgence” of the “Indian question.”<br>

In both regards, it is nevertheless obvious that some of the trends of the 1980s were consolidated towards and beyond the millennium. Uncertainty, or ambivalence, became a standard feature (some would say an affectation) of intellectual life, certainly in the humanities and social sciences; although trends representing a more positivist view, seeking less equivocal answers to the perennial questions of anthropology, were also on the rise.

  Book Title: Small Places, Large Issues-An Introduction to Social and Cultural Anthropology (Fourth Edition)<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Eriksen Thomas Hylland<br>
  Abstract: This concise introduction to social and cultural anthropology has become a modern classic, revealing the rich global variation in social life and culture. The text provides a clear overview of anthropology, focusing on central topics such as kinship, ethnicity, ritual and political systems, offering a wealth of examples that demonstrate the enormous scope of anthropology and the importance of a comparative perspective. Unlike other texts on the subject, Small Places, Large Issues incorporates the anthropology of complex modern societies. Using reviews of key monographs to illustrate his argument, Eriksen's lucid and accessible text remains an established introductory text in anthropology. This new, fourth edition is updated throughout and increases the emphasis on the interdependence of human worlds. There is a new discussion of the new influence cultural studies and natural science on anthropology. Effortless bridging the perceived gap between "classic" and "contemporary" anthropology, Small Places, Large Issues is as essential to anthropology undergraduates as ever.<br>

  2  A Brief History of Anthropology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p184">Small Places, Large Issues</a><br>
  Abstract: Like the other social sciences, anthropology has fairly recent origins. It developed as an academic discipline during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, but it has important forerunners in earlier historiography, geography, travel writing, philosophy, comparative linguistics and jurisprudence. There are many ways of writing the history of anthropology, just as there may exist, in any given society, competing versions of national history or origin myths, promoted by groups or individuals with diverging interests. History is not primarily a product of the past itself, but is rather shaped by the concerns of the present. As these concerns change, past<br>

  3  Fieldwork and Ethnography from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p184">Small Places, Large Issues</a><br>
  Abstract: Anthropology distinguishes itself from the other social sciences through the strong emphasis placed on ethnographic fieldwork as the most important source of new knowledge about society and culture. A field study may last for a few months, a year, or even two years or more, and it aims to develop as intimate an understanding as possible of the phenomena investigated. Many anthropologists return to the same field throughout their career, to deepen their understanding further or to record change. Although there are differences in field methods between different anthropological schools, it is generally agreed that the anthropologist ought to stay<br>

  Abstract: Just as the anthropological study of politics is markedly different from the discipline of political science, economic anthropology distinguishes itself in important ways from the economic sciences. Anthropologists have always – at least since Boas and Malinowski – wished to call attention to the ways in which the economy is an integrated part of a social and cultural totality, and to reveal that economic systems and actions can only be fully understood if we look into their interrelationships with other aspects of culture and society. Just as politics ought to be seen as part of a wider system which includes<br>

  Book Title: White Identities-A Critical Sociological Approach<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): GARNER STEVE<br>
  Abstract: The study of white ethnicities is becoming increasingly important in the social sciences. This book provides a critical introduction to the topic. Whiteness has traditionally been seen as "ethnically transparent" - the marker against which other ethnicities are measured. This analysis is clearly incorrect, but only recently have many race and ethnicity scholars moved away from focusing on ethnic minorities and instead oriented their studies around the construction of white identities. Simon Clarke and Steve Garner's book is designed to guide students as they explore how white identities are forged using both sociological and psycho-social ideas. Including an excellent survey of the existing literature and original research from the UK, this book will be an invaluable guide for sociology students taking modules in race and ethnicity.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p383">White Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: Psycho-social studies is an emerging tradition that very much focuses on emotion and affect to illuminate some of the core issues in the social sciences. Issues such as identity construction, dilemmas in public service sectors and the experience of rapid social change. It recognises that the split between individual and society, sociology and psychology is now unhelpful if we are to understand social and psychological phenomena. It therefore seeks to research beneath the surface using both psychoanalytic and sociological ideas using innovative new methodologies including the use of free association, biographical life history interviews and the development of psychoanalytic fieldwork.<br>

  Book Title: Fredrik Barth-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Garsten Christina<br>
  Abstract: Fredrik Barth is one of the towering figures of twentieth-century anthropology. This intellectual history traces the development of Barth’s ideas and explores the substance of his contributions. In an accessible style, Thomas Eriksen’s biographical study reveals the magic of ethnography to professional anthropologists and non-practitioners alike. Exploring his six decade career, it follows Barth from early ecological studies in Pakistan, to political studies in Iran, to groundbreaking fieldwork in Norway, New Guinea, Bali and Bhutan. Eriksen argues that Barth's voracious appetite for fieldwork holds the key to understanding his remarkable intellectual development and the insights it produced. The book raises many of the same questions that emerge from Barth's own work - of unity and diversity, of culture and relativism, of art and science. Thomas Eriksen is himself a major contributor to the study of anthropology, as well as a distinguished educator, and is therefore ideally placed to introduce the life and work of Fredrik Barth. This will surely be the definitive book on its subject for many years to come.<br>

  Abstract: It was mainly from his colleagues and students that Barth sought – and received – inspiration on an everyday basis. The sociologist Stein Rokkan worked, like Barth, with comparative models, but he worked historically at the macro level, and their relationship was respectful, but restricted. Other ‘professor entrepreneurs’ in the burgeoning social science departments of the new university were useful allies in the effort to establish a faculty of social science at Bergen, but there was no intellectual affinity. The philosopher Knut Tranøy was a loyal ally and a personal friend, but there were no intellectual synergies to speak of<br>

  Abstract: Trends and fashions come and go in the social sciences, but rarely without leaving something useful behind. From Foucault, we have kept concepts about discourse, power and regimes of knowledge; from Bourdieu, habitus, doxa and forms of capital; from Marxism, a sustained critical interest in power and economics; and from structuralism, the acknowledgement that the human mind functions in a particular way, frequently by way of contrasts. Nonetheless, structuralism, in its original form, is all but forgotten today. Few take up the cues left by 1960s and 1970s Marxism. Neither ethnoscience nor ethnomethodology are read as anything but intellectual history<br>

  Book Title: The Trouble with Community-Anthropological Reflections on Movement, Identity and Collectivity<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: 'Community' is one of social science's longest-standing concepts. The assumption, of much social science, has been that it is in communities -- and to communities -- that human individuals, as social and cultural beings, belong. Communities are said to embody that interactive environment from which individuals' identities and senses of self derive, and in which they continue to dwell. The trouble with 'community' is that this is not necessarily so; the personal social networks of individuals' actual experience crosscut collective categories, situations and institutions. Communities can prove unviable or imprisoning; the reality of community life and identity can often be very different from the ideology and the ideal. In this provocative new book, anthropologists Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport draw on their various ethnographic experiences to reappraise the concept and the reality of 'community', in the light of globalization, religious fundamentalism, identity politics, and renascent localisms. How might anthropology better apprehend social identities which are intrinsically plural, transgressive and ironic? What has anthropology to say about the way in which civil society might hope to accommodate the on-going construction and the rightful expression of such migrant identities? Nigel Rapport and Vered Amit give their own answers to these questions before entering into dialogue to assess each other's positions. Nigel Rapport is Professor of Anthropological and Philosophical Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is author of Transcendent Individual (1997). Vered Amit is an Associate Professor at Concordia University in Montreal. She is the editor of Realizing Community (2002).<br>

  Abstract: Arriving at a final assessment of the value of Bourdieu’s immense and varied output is no easy task. By placing his work in the interrelated contexts of the intellectual field out of which it emerged and the social and cultural changes it has analysed, this study has sought to emphasise the immense perceptiveness with which Bourdieu has traced the dynamic of these changes in postwar France. Indeed, he has often shown considerable prescience, anticipating the future development of socio-cultural phenomena or crystallising a more general or vaguely perceived sense of malaise.

After all, particularly as it is practiced in the contemporary academy, politics or political science is a discipline famed for its “seriousness”; its social-science predictive ways; its focus on institutions, structures of power, and governance; and its avoidance of the messy stuff of culture, agency, and desire. Could anything be less oddball, less hospitable to the playfulness of hoaxers and hoarders, or the incongruity of dissected fish and Dixie cups?<br>

In exploring both questions, the convergence of what is happening in medical science and biotechnologies and in the readings of the Christian tradition will reveal that we are amazing, complex bodyselves who are called to be creatures of God, alongside the rest of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgg3z">Engaging Bonhoeffer</a><br>
  Author(s) Gregor Brian<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur was one of the leading French philosophers of the twentieth centuries. He was also one of the most erudite. From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  Author(s) Proudfoot Wayne<br>
  Abstract: The word “naturalism” is used in many different ways in contemporary philosophy. For some, it has required that a properly naturalistic account appeal only to what is countenanced by the natural sciences, but there have been a number of recent attempts to formulate more liberal approaches to naturalism that allow for natural accounts that recognize the normative character of beliefs, practices, actions, and institutions.¹ A certain priority is rightly given to the sciences in the sense that, as Huw Price has put it, science tells us that humans are natural creatures, and any naturalistic approach should honor that.² But that<br>

  Book Title: Husserl's Missing Technologies-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): IHDE DON<br>
  Abstract: Husserl's Missing Technologies looks at the early-twentieth-century "classical" phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, both in the light of the philosophy of science of his time, and retrospectively at his philosophy from a contemporary "postphenomenology." Of central interest are his infrequent comments upon technologies and especially scientific instruments such as the telescope and microscope. Together with his analysis of Husserl, Don Ihde ventures through the recent history of technologies of science, reading and writing, and science praxis, calling for modifications to phenomenology by converging it with pragmatism. This fruitful hybridization emphasizes human-technology interrelationships, the role of embodiment and bodily skills, and the inherent multistability of technologies. In a radical argument, Ihde contends that philosophies, in the same way that various technologies contain an ever-shortening obsolescence, ought to have contingent use-lives.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t7k7">Theology in the Flesh</a><br>
  Abstract: The recent revolution in cognitive science has investigated how human minds make sense of our experience, uncovering the ways we find meaning in everything from various shapes to blinking lights. Cognitive linguistics is part of this revolutionary discovery. The study of cognitive linguistics began in the 1970s and is an influential approach to meaning construction used by an international body of scholars.¹ Cognitive linguistics examines how we think about the entire range of human experience, including causation, motion, time, relationships, entities, and emotions.² The research is interdisciplinary in nature, involving fields such as psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, philosophy, sign language, and<br>

  Abstract: This chapter examines our moral reasoning in light of embodied cognition, metaphor, prototypes, and frames. Morality here is broadly construed in the sense of what communities consider to be good and of value. The purpose is not to propose an ethical theory, but simply, to explore how cognitive linguistics can assist us in understanding what is involved in some aspects of moral reasoning and explain why Christians in general—and American Christians in particular—agree on some basics, yet disagree on many issues. It also draws upon some recent work in cognitive science to suggest the importance of exemplars for<br>

This association was founded in 1910 as a centre for the promotion of science, education, trade, and manufacture. Alerted by a lack of interest in the Dutch colonies, in particular the East Indies (now Indonesia), the association’s founders conceived of the Colonial Institute as a center for the collection and study of data and objects of, and the dissemination of knowledge about, Dutch overseas territories.

  Abstract: Various nations produced popular science films during the first twenty years of cinema history. The first systematic production of films on scientific topics for a wide audience came about in England, where F. Martin Duncan’s “The UnseenWorld” series, made for the Charles Urban Company, debuted in 1903. In late 1909 and early 1910, there was a flourishing of

  Author(s) Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: Until now, psychology has barely dealt with the topics of historical consciousness and historical thought. Although the discipline has given thorough attention to other forms of thought—to other forms of the construction of reality—there is no distinctive tradition with the theoretical or clinical objective of establishing a psychology of specifically historical acts of meaning-construction. Seen properly, this is astonishing. Psychology is commonly considered one of the key modern sciences that aspire to investigate as well as to shape our relationships to others and to the world from a genetic, structural, and functional perspective. However, a generally acknowledged characteristic<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbw85">Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness</a><br>
  Author(s) Polkinghorne Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern theory has severely undercut the notion that historians can produce objective and accurate descriptions of past episodes. Instead, it proposes that discovering the factual truth about historical events is extremely problematic because knowledge production is relative to the values and agenda of the inquirer. The question of the validity of historical knowledge has informed the general topic “Making Sense of History,” the theme of the book series of which the present volume is a part.

  Abstract: The usual answer to this question is a kind of doxology delivered in the name of “the scientific method”: Thou shalt not indulge self-delusion, nor utter unverifiable propositions, nor commit contradiction, nor treat mere history as cause, and so on. Story is not the accepted stuff of science and “logic.” If meaning-making were always dedicated to achieving a “scientific” understanding of the world, that would be one thing. But neither the empiricist’s knowledge through the senses, nor the rationalist’s route through necessary truths suffice: neither alone nor both together capture how ordinary people go about assigning meanings to their experiences—<br>

  Abstract: Two decades ago, inquiry into narrative played but a minor role in scholarly deliberation; the relationship between narrative analysis and historiography was little explored; the term “narrative” had scarcely entered the vocabulary of psychological science. Today, the study of narrative concatenates throughout the humanities and the social sciences, and the problems raised by such analyses for our conception of history, along with the historical consciousness of the individual, are profound. Further, there are now many distinct and well-articulated orientations toward narrative: realist, phenomenological, psychodynamic, cognitive, textual, and rhetorical among them.

  Author(s) Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: Until now, psychology has barely dealt with the topics of historical consciousness and historical thought. Although the discipline has given thorough attention to other forms of thought—to other forms of the construction of reality—there is no distinctive tradition with the theoretical or clinical objective of establishing a psychology of specifically historical acts of meaning-construction. Seen properly, this is astonishing. Psychology is commonly considered one of the key modern sciences that aspire to investigate as well as to shape our relationships to others and to the world from a genetic, structural, and functional perspective.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbw85">Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness</a><br>
  Author(s) Polkinghorne Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern theory has severely undercut the notion that historians can produce objective and accurate descriptions of past episodes. Instead, it proposes that discovering the factual truth about historical events is extremely problematic because knowledge production is relative to the values and agenda of the inquirer. The question of the validity of historical knowledge has informed the general topic “Making Sense of History,” the theme of the book series of which the present volume is a part. The postmodern critique of the modernist epistemology of the humanities and social sciences has produced considerable consternation and disturbance in most of these disciplines.<br>

  Book Title: Critical Junctions-Anthropology and History beyond the Cultural Turn<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Tak Herman<br>
  Abstract: This volume focuses on the conjunction of two disciplines where both the analytic promises as well as the difficulties involved in the meeting of humanist and social science approaches soon became obvious. Anthropologists and historians have come together here in order to recapture, elaborate, and criticize pre-Cultural Turn and non-Cultural Turn modes of analysing structures of experience, feeling, subjectivity and action in human societies and to highlight the still unexploited possibilities developed among others in the work of scholars such as Norbert Elias, Max Gluckman, Eric Wolf, E.P. Thompson and Raymond Williams.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbxqc">Critical Junctions</a><br>
  Author(s) Tak Herman<br>
  Abstract: This collection of studies and essays seeks to address the pitfalls of, and the alternatives to, what has become known as the “cultural turn” (or the “historic turn”) in the social and human sciences. The cultural turn has been a multifarious and pretty pervasive phenomenon in Western universities and modes of social knowledge since the early 1980s, when, in Bill Sewell’s phrasing, a “kind of academic culture mania has set in” (Sewell 1999: 36). It embraced parts of anthropology, sociology, social theory, gender studies, literary studies, various branches of history, and science studies and laid the philosophical groundwork for the<br>

  Author(s) Kalb Don<br>
  Abstract: Few serious social researchers would deny the inescapability of pondering the conundrum of class—a conundrum because, while steadily contested, politically compromised, and conceptually inflated, the unsettling suspicion keeps surfacing that class involves inequality, power, culture, exploitation, accumulation, struggle and action, being in history and the making of history, being in place and the making of space, all in the same moment. Class, power, time, and space together form a huge program that has haunted social inquiry since Marx. Disciplined social science, on the other hand, has been a recurrent escape from its embrace, and understandably so, since it is<br>

  Abstract: "Identity" has become a core concept of the social and cultural sciences. Bringing together perspectives from sociology, anthropology, psychology, history, and literary criticism, this book offers a comprehensive and critical overview on how this concept is currently used and how it relates to memory and constructions of historical meaning.<br>

  Chapter 2  Identity and Selfhood as a Problématique from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbz63">Identities</a><br>
  Author(s) Wagner Peter<br>
  Abstract: Many formalised discourses of the human sciences—such as law, liberal political philosophy and neo-classical economics—work with a notion of the singular human being as a unit that is characterised by its indivisibility, for those reasons also called the individual. An additional assumption about the guiding orientation or behaviour of these units then needs to be introduced to arrive at ways of conceptualising stable collectivities. In the discourses mentioned above, this assumption is basically one of rationality, with specific variations. In liberal political theory, their capacity for rationality leads the individuals to enter into a social contract for their<br>

  Author(s) Lüsebrink Hans-jürgen<br>
  Abstract: In the Western cultural and social sciences, one usually considers the existence of a nation from three main angles: 1) that of the existence of a national state, 2) of a community living within some well-defined borders, and 3) through national awareness, in which national history can play a central role. In the case of African history and historiography, it is necessary though to reconsider the question with the help of criteria which differ from those used to study its European counterpart:<br>

  Abstract: This essay¹ concerns the paradoxes emerging in the dynamic space of hybridisation between vodou magic² and the occult science of anthroposophy. These lived imaginaries and registers of interpretation are engaged within counter-modernising environmental discourses and practices in the Dominican-Haitian borderlands. Here NGO-affiliated European anthroposophists, orientated by the work of Rudolf Steiner,³ are organising a biodynamic programme in co-operation with marginalised Dominican and Haitian borderlands peasants who live the consequences of radical deforestation. These peasants have for long been subjugated to the often violent dictates of post-colonial ruling élites, and their world of vodou spirits is itself the creation of ‘resistant<br>

  Author(s) Bryceson Deborah Fahy<br>
  Abstract: Currently, much of anthropological literature on identity finds itself in unanticipated dialogue with other social science disciplines in a period of deepening global insecurity. The optimism of the last half-century, an era viewed as one of unparalleled economic progress for much of the world, is now being replaced by a profound pessimism in the West about the spread of social intolerance and terrorism in the twenty-first century. Even before the events of 11 September and the London bombings of July 2005, unease was surfacing. American political scientists took the lead in the cultural commentary, drawing attention to the decline in<br>

  Book Title: Critical White Studies-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stefancic Jean<br>
  Abstract: No longer content with accepting whiteness as the norm, critical scholars have turned their attention to whiteness itself. In
      Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror, numerous thinkers, including Toni Morrison, Eric Foner, Peggy McIntosh, Andrew Hacker, Ruth Frankenberg, John Howard Griffin, David Roediger, Kathleen Heal Cleaver, Noel Ignatiev, Cherrie Moraga, and Reginald Horsman, attack such questions as:*How was whiteness invented, and why?*How has the category whiteness changed over time?*Why did some immigrant groups, such as the Irish and Jews, start out as nonwhite and later became white?*Can some individual people be both white and nonwhite at different times, and what does it mean to "pass for white"?*At what point does pride in being white cross the line into white power or white supremacy?*What can whites concerned over racial inequity or white privilege do about it?Science and pseudoscience are presented side by side to demonstrate how our views on whiteness often reflect preconception, not fact. For example, most scientists hold that race is not a valid scientific category -- genetic differences between races are insignificant compared to those within them. Yet, the "one drop" rule, whereby those with any nonwhite heritage are classified as nonwhite, persists even today. As the bell curve controversy shows, race concepts die hard, especially when power and prestige lie behind them.A sweeping portrait of the emerging field of whiteness studies,Critical White Studiespresents, for the first time, the best work from sociology, law, history, cultural studies, and literature. Delgado and Stefancic expressly offer critical white studies as the next step in critical race theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do they ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to "look behind the mirror."<br>

  Author(s) HOVENKAMP HERBERT<br>
  Abstract: No historical legal policy can be evaluated without an understanding of the framework in which the policymakers viewed the world. If members of a society believe a particular scientific theory—for example, that interracial sex produces degenerate children—then they may be willing to sacrifice a great deal to avoid the consequences of interracial marriages. If they later discover that interracial marriages have no such consequences, then their views will probably change accordingly. In short, people’s scientific view of the world determines in large part the social situation that they regard as optimal. The genetic determinism that dominated social science<br>

  Author(s) WOOLDRIDGE ADRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Opposition to the use of IQ testing goes back as far as testing itself. Its practitioners have been accused of misusing science to justify capitalist exploitation; allowing their obsession with classification to blind them to the huge variety of human abilities; encouraging soulless teaching; and, worst of all, inflaming racial prejudices and justifying racial inequalities. To this school of thinking,
                  The Bell Curvewas a godsend. Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein succeeded in effectively linking IQ testing firmly in people’s minds with spectacularly unpopular arguments: that different racial groups have different IQ averages; that America is calcifying into rigid<br>

  Abstract: In his commentaries on a series of papers on “Indian Religion,” the distinguished philosopher of religion and Indologist Alexander Piatigorski theorizes that, despite the widely accepted notion that the emergence of the anthropology of religion as a science was historically connected with a widespread cultural rejection of religious belief, anthropology remains, from the point of view of an external observer, “an epiphenomenon of Christian culture.” This is evident, Piatigorski argues, in the way in which concepts such as “religion,” “magic,” “god,” or “myth” are deployed in scholarly texts.

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Abstract: The spectral debut of “literary theory” in elite sectors of the public sphere in the United States and Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s is a historical and cultural phenomenon that still awaits nonsuperficial historical and cultural analysis.² Perhaps it will always be awaiting it—Jacques Derrida suggests as much in the well-known opening paragraph, reproduced in the epigraph to this chapter, of “Force and Signification” (1963). Derrida’s subsequent paragraph speaks with even sharper prescience to the polemics of subsequent decades:<br>

  Book Title: Memory-Histories, Theories, Debates<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHWARZ BILL<br>
  Abstract: Memory has never been closer to us, yet never more difficult to understand. In the more than thirty specially commissioned essays that make up this book, leading scholars survey the histories, the theories, and the faultlines that compose the field of memory research.The volume reconstructs the work of the great philosophical and literary figures of the last two centuries who recast the concept of memory and brought it into the forefront of the modernist and postmodernist imagination-among them, Bergson, Halbwachs, Freud, Proust, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Deleuze. Drawing on recent advances in the sciences and in the humanities, the contributors address thequestion of how memory works, highlighting transactions between the interiority of subjective memory and the larger fields of public or collective memory.The public, political life of memory is an increasingly urgent issue in the societies we now inhabit, while the category of memory itself seems to become ever more capacious.Asking how we might think about the politics of memory, the closing chapters explore anumber of defining instances in which the troubled phenomenon of memory has entered and reshaped our very conception of what makes and drives the domain of politics. These include issues of slavery, the Soviet experience, the Holocaust, feminism and recovered memory, and memory in post-apartheid South Africa.<br>

  Abstract: IN THIS chapter, I consider Milton’s intervention in the debate concerning things indifferent in his prose works. As we will see, in enlarging the sphere of things indifferent and giving the individual conscience discretion in such matters, Milton departs from the usual puritan position, according to which “nothing is indifferent.” At the same time, he develops the principle of indifference into a rhetoric, thereby dramatizing his awareness that the sphere of indifference is the sphere of rhetoric, in which persuasion and action may take place. Milton’s Machiavellism in his prose works is both general and specific. In reflecting on the<br>

  Abstract: “Way-finding” is the term that modern islanders use to describe their craft and the craft of their ancestors in piloting their voyaging canoes around the Great Ocean, the Pacific, and the Sea of Islands. They prefer to call themselves way-finders rather than navigators. Navigation is a more universal science of instruments and the application of systems of time and space as broad as the cosmos itself. Way-finding is a more interpretive craft closer to the signs the systems of the cosmos imprint on the environment. No navigators would distance themselves from the myriad of signs in sea and sky, wind<br>

  Book Title: Freud's Moses-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: In
      Freud's
            Mosesa distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

  Book Title: The Idea of Wilderness-From Prehistory to the Age of Ecology<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OELSCHLAEGER MAX<br>
  Abstract: Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, and idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the unprecedented concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to "modernism" arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America's two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.<br>

                  Modernism—understood as a historical movement that begins with the Renaissance and extends to the present—is in this sense analogous to alchemy, for through science, technology, and liberal democracy modern people hoped to transform a base and worthless wilderness into industrialized, democratic civilization.

Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to "modernism" arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America's two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  The Alchemy of Modernism: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cc2krg">The Idea of Wilderness</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout the middle ages human beings dreamed of transmuting common metal into precious gold through alchemy. Although this aspiration led to a handsome living for many an alchemist, employed by those who desired the proverbial something for nothing, the hope was never realized.
                  Modernism—understood as a historical movement that begins with the Renaissance and extends to the present—is in this sense analogous to alchemy, for through science, technology, and liberal democracy modern people hoped to transform a base and worthless wilderness into industrialized, democratic civilization. Modernism, like the classicism of antiquity, thus continued the humanization of wild nature<br>

  Abstract: Since the publication of Descartcs’s
                  Discourse on Method(1637) andMeditations(1641) and Newton’sPrincipia Mathematica(1687), the mechanistic model has dominated natural science, The Cartesian-Newtonian paradigm enjoys cognitive hegemony in the modern world, displacing any aesthetic, religious, or philosophical claim to insight or knowledge. And long before the social sciences emerged, such thinkers as Thomas Hobbes and Adam Smith were modeling their treatises on the structure of political and economic society on the mechanistic paradigm, attempting to capture in human affairs what was being achieved in natural science: theoretical elegance and precision leading to predictive knowledge and causal control.<br>

  Book Title: In the Fellowship of His Suffering-A Theological Interpretation of Mental Illness — A Focus on "Schizophrenia"<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Swinton John<br>
  Abstract: Schizophrenia is often considered one of the most destructive forms of mental illness. Elahe Hessamfar’s personal experience with her daughter’s illness has led her to ask some pressing and significant questions about the cause and nature of schizophrenia and the Church’s role in its treatment. With a candid and revealing look at the history of mental illness, In the Fellowship of His Suffering describes schizophrenia as a variation of human expression. Hessamfar uses a deeply theological rather than pathological approach to interpret the schizophrenic experience and the effect it has on both the patients and their families. Effectively drawing on the Bible as a source of knowledge for understanding mental illness, she offers a reflective yet innovative view of whether the Church could or should intervene in such encounters and what such an intervention might look like. Hessamfar’s comprehensive work will provoke powerful responses from anyone interested in the prominent social issue of mental illness. Her portrayal of the raging debate between treating “insanity" either pastorally or medically will enthral readers, be they Christians, medical students or those in the field of psychiatry and social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we evaluated the burgeoning psychiatric research to get a handle on the medical framing of madness. Our evaluation left us wanting. We realized that science with all its claims has yet to conquer the stunning complexities of this phenomenon. I argued, based on a variety of research findings, that “schizophrenia” should be regarded as a variation of human expression, rather than as pathology.² To unravel the mystery of madness as a human phenomenon, I suggest that we need to shift our paradigm of understanding and appeal to biblical revelation for illumination.

  Abstract: In the last chapter, I argued that illnesses are not purely meaningless biological phenomena. Particularly, with regards to mental illness (an area where medical science has been severely challenged to offer satisfactory explanations of the experience), the voice of illness ought to be heard in the context of the sufferer’s community. In reference to a psychotic experience Aderhold et al., remind us that, “It is not the psychosis—whatever this might be—that is being treated, but a human being in the midst of an altered experience” who should be “supported and accompanied, realizing that each individual is very different<br>

  Abstract: The ruined churches of

The death of personhood is closely connected to evil: wherever Being stops and Non-Being starts, there is space for negation and fear. The collapse of the house of religion in the West and the absence of a personal God contribute to a metaphysical void that is claimed by Satan who is the denier of any existence. The postmodern Satan appears without the attributes, both physical and behavioral<br>

  Book Title: Why Resurrection?-An Introduction to the Belief in the Afterlife in Judaism and Christianity<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Blanco Carlos<br>
  Abstract: Few questions exert such a great fascination on human conscience as those related to the meaning of life, history, and death. The belief in the resurrection of the dead constitutes an answer to a real challenge: What is the meaning of life and history in the midst of a world in which evil, injustice, and ultimately death exist? Resurrection is an instrument serving a broader, more encompassing reality: the Kingdom of God. Such a utopian Kingdom gathers the final response to the problem of theodicy and to the enigma of history. <CR><CR> This book seeks to understand the idea of resurrection not only as a theological but also as a philosophical category (as expression of the collective aspirations of humanity), combining historical, theological, and philosophical analyses in dialogue with some of the principal streams of contemporary Western thought.<br>

Obviously the nountheologyis itself problematic in terms of what it means to speak of a “God word” or a “word about God.” Nonetheless, its constant usage, though in diverse ways, in the arenas of church and theological science makes it a familiar term used with confidence and regularity.

In order to understand MacDonald’s view of Scripture, especially as related to the “parabolic” and the role Scripture plays in his understanding of revelation and spiritual transformation, it is important to locate him in his historical context.

  Abstract: A cross different academic disciplines, we are witnessing a fundamental and perhaps paradigmatic shift away from individuality towards relationality. Both natural sciences and humanities are seeing the emergence of different relational models that attempt to theorize the widespread recognition that reality cannot be reduced to self-generating, individual beings and that the outcome of interactions between various entities is more than the sum of parts (whether these be more atomistic or more collectivist). For instance, in particle physics it has been suggested that there are “things” such as quarks (subatomic particles) which cannot be measured individually because they are confined by<br>

  Book Title: Radical Embodiment-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nikkel David H.<br>
  Abstract: "Radical embodiment" refers to an anthropology and an epistemology fundamentally rooted in our bodies as always in correlation with our natural and social worlds. All human rationality, meaning, and value arise not only instrumentally but also substantively from this embodiment in the world. Radical embodiment reacts against Enlightenment mind-body dualism, as well as its monistic offshoots, including the physicalism that reduces everything to component matter-energy at the expense of subjectivity and meaning. It also rejects certain forms of postmodernism that reinscribe modern dualisms. David H. Nikkel develops the perspective of "radical embodiment" by examining varieties of modern and postmodern theology, and the nature and role of tradition-in terms of linguistic and non-linguistic experience, the religion and science dialogue on the nature of consciousness, and the immanent and transcendent aspects of God.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Howell Brian C.<br>
  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. In this new work, Howell shows that instances of divine action should not automatically be reduced simply to theological categories such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, etc., nor to criteria such as personhood, life, and approachability. Rather, he introduced readers to two unique approaches to “anthropomorphic expressions".<br>

Delhaye, qui n’avait pas obtenu de poste à Louvain et qui, de ce fait, avait dû s’expatrier à Lille et à Montréal, enseignait alors à temps partiel au nouvel Institut de sciences religieuses à l’Université de Montréal.

Plusieurs stratégies littéraires peuvent servir à mettre l’acte de lecture en évidence, c’est-à-dire à faire prendre conscience au lecteur du fait qu’il est en train de lire : l’inscription de personnages écrivains ou lecteurs, l’enchâssement de textes à un second degré, la mise en abyme du texte, entre autres.

  Book Title: Husserl and the Sciences-Selected Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): FEIST RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) is one of the previous century's most important thinkers. Often regarded as the "Father of phenomenology," this collection of essays reveals that he is indeed much more than that. The breadth of Husserl's thought is considerable and much remains unexplored. An underlying theme of this volume is that Husserl is constantly returning to origins, revising his thought in the light of new knowledge offered by the sciences.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from:

  Author(s) Feist Richard<br>
  Abstract: The founder of the phenomenological movement, Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), lived through a dynamic time for the sciences.¹ Not only were there major developments in mathematics and physics, but some of the greatest practitioners of these disciplines were pursuing foundational questions with an unprecedented depth and rigour. Although Husserl did not directly contribute to these developments, it is not correct to say that he simply sat on the sidelines. He personally knew and corresponded with several of the finest scientific and mathematical minds of the time. It is, therefore, not surprising that the relationship between Husserl’s philosophy and the sciences is<br>

  Abstract: Husserl, a trained mathematician, just like Frege and Bolzano, and student of two of the most notable scholars of that field, Kronecker and Weierstrass, had first-hand knowledge of his contemporaries’ scientific work. Although his contribution to mathematics as such remains modest, one would be wrong to minimize the importance of formal and natural sciences within Husserl’s philosophical itinerary. For instance, his project of a universal
                  mathesisand the articulation of his doctrine of definite manifolds were Husserl’s response to mathematical problems, namely, those of imaginary numbers, and are among the few ideas to which Husserl remained faithful until the end<br>

  Author(s) Kerszberg Pierre<br>
  Abstract: Ever since the rise of the modern exact sciences, it has become more and more clear that the scientific mind is not bound by an exhaustive understanding of its own doings. The fact is that, while discovering the inner structure or the nexus of relations pertaining to an object, science ignores the paths that led to this structure or these relations; but these paths lie precisely at the basis of the ontological ground of the object. Husserl reflected on this legacy of the scientific revolution when he argued that “it is not always natural science that speaks when natural scientists<br>

  Book Title: Du corps des femmes-Contrôles, surveillances et résistances<br>

  Author(s): KÉRISIT MICHÈLE<br>
  Abstract: Peint et chanté, voilé ou dévoilé, usé et abusé, le corps féminin est depuis toujours au centre de la création artistique occidentale. Qu'en est-il, cependant, de sa place dans les sciences sociales ? Comment le corps des femmes a-t-il été pensé et représenté en sociologie, en criminologie, en travail social ou en gérontologie, par exemple ? Cet ouvrage collectif a pour premier objectif d'amorcer ce travail critique en débusquant les logiques patriarcales qui dominent les discours savants développés dans les différentes disciplines des sciences sociales et mettant en scène le corps des femmes. Ce faisant, il montre également comment se sont historiquement construites, et se construisent encore, des représentations de corps de femmes illégitimes ou transgresseurs ou dangereux. Le second objectif de cet ouvrage est de repenser cette image en mettant en lumière les multiples façons que les femmes peuvent utiliser pour subvertir ces représentations dominantes et pour se poser comme sujets tant dans l'élaboration des savoirs que dans la sphère du politique.<br>

  Abstract: The nature of time has been an irresistible mystery for philosophers for thousands of years. The same is no less true today, although questions of time have changed dramatically under the influence of physicists such as Newton and Einstein, and the hegemony of the natural sciences. For instance, most no longer think of time in terms of the Ancient Greeks’ cyclical time, modelled on the periodical rhythms of nature, or Christian eschatological time (rectilinear historical time), with its actual though postponed Kingdom in the present age (both fulfilled and fulfilling). While elements of both persist—such as the association of<br>

Plus encore, la conception de la plupart des phénoménologues varie tout au long de leur recherche, se modifi ant aux tournants de leurs chemins de pensée. Aussi est-il impossible de donner une défi nition univoque de la phénoménologie et d’assigner au mouvement phénoménologique une quelconque unité doctrinale. En effet, comme l’a montré Claude Piché¹, depuis Lambert, le concept de phénoménologie n’a cessé d’évoluer. Au départ science de l’apparence, la phénoménologie a fini par devenir, chez Heidegger, la science de ce qui n’apparaît pas à première<br>

  Book Title: Northrop Frye-New Directions from Old<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

Les chercheurs ne sont concernés que par les effets physiques des traitements mis en oeuvre.

While he always maintained a respect for many of the contributions of Western science, he relied especially in his own work on scientists who tested new waters and were often only tentatively accepted by the established scientific community. He considered these scientists to give credibility to the counter-Enlightenment traditions that he upheld. His overriding interest remained cultural; therefore, his questions for science were concerned with the cultural assumptions and effects of<br>

Similarly, astronomers can run their calculations backwards in time and verify whether eclipses recorded in ancient texts really did occur at the time described.

  Abstract: Despite the monster’s pervasive presence within the medium, academics writing about zombies in popular culture can have a somewhat smug attitude toward video games. There is often something slightly elitist in the attitude of theorists in their treatment of the video-game zombie as a lesser creature, a monstrous aberration in comparison to the true undead of cinema. Kyle Bishop’s disparaging description of the first
                  Resident Evilfilm as “an action-packed science fiction movie that is more video game than narrative” (2009, 19) resonates with Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska’s observation that, within the cultural hierarchy, comparing films to games represents<br>

  Abstract: Derrida is evidently a Blanchotian philosopher. While continuing to affirm Heidegger’s influence, he radicalizes, through Levinas, the thought of
                  differencein order to methodologically establish the condition for a “science of the singular.” Here, the thinking of the event and its challenge to modern existence must first of all takes the shape of a concrete and dramaticperformanceof writing: to write in the limits and in the margins of thinking so that the making of the work itself testifies to the subversive powers at play when the grounds of thinking come under question.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d9nm18">Ethos and Narrative Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: As has been amply observed, the current proliferation of narratologies did not exactly increase disciplinary consensus on terms and procedures. Concepts that involve ethos attribution, such as those of the implied author or the (un)reliability of narrators, play a central role in rhetorical, ethical, and other forms of critically engaged narratologies, yet there is not much agreement about even these core concepts. This should not come as a surprise, since such concepts bring into the open fundamental divergences of opinion and uncertainties about what narratology is or should be.¹ The appeal to cognitive sciences has not really solved this problem,<br>

  Author(s) LAMONT MARK<br>
  Abstract: In Europe, social anthropology is a major social science that can now boast thousands of participants. This was not the case in the 1920s and 1930s, when the number of professional, university-trained anthropologists was limited to a few dozen individuals (Goody 1995; Kuper 1983). The subject is not taught in high schools, yet university recruitment remains robust, even in recent decades when government cutbacks threaten even some of the oldest, most established fields in the humanities and social sciences. It would seem, on the surface, that anthropology has something to offer. While the reasons individuals would choose to study anthropology<br>

  Book Title: Artifacts and Illuminations-Critical Essays on Loren Eiseley<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska Paperback<br>
  Author(s): MAHER SUSAN N.<br>
  Abstract: As a writer who bridged the sciences and the humanities, Eiseley is a challenge for scholars locked into rigid disciplinary boundaries.
      Artifacts and Illuminations, the first full-length collection of critical essays on the writing of Eiseley, situates his work in the genres of creative nonfiction and nature writing. The contributing scholars apply a variety of critical approaches, including ecocriticism and place-oriented studies ranging across prairie, urban, and international contexts. Contributors explore such diverse topics as Eiseley's use of anthropomorphism and Jungian concepts and examine how his work was informed by synecdoche. Long overdue, this collection demonstrates Eiseley's continuing relevance as both a skilled literary craftsman and a profound thinker about the human place in the natural world.<br>

  Author(s) LYNCH TOM<br>
  Abstract: Loren Eiseley’s literary reputation today rests almost exclusively on the significance of his nonfiction nature essays, which deservedly stand as influential exemplars of creative nonfiction science and nature writing. However, in his early years as an undergraduate at the University of Nebraska, Eiseley had the reputation as an important and promising poet, and he published poetry in a range of literary journals. Most notably, his work appeared in the earliest editions of
                  Prairie Schooner, whose editorial staff he joined in 1927, the year after it began publication. And, not limited to his own school’s journal, he published in a variety<br>

  13  Eiseley and Jung: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d9nqjg">Artifacts and Illuminations</a><br>
  Author(s) NIZALOWSKI JOHN<br>
  Abstract: In his essay “Loren Eiseley’s
                     Immense Journey,” Andrew J. Angyal celebrates the revered nature writer’s unconventional public stance: “As Eiseley warns his readers repeatedly, he is not a spokesman for conventional science. Instead, he is a poet-shaman, a wizard-alchemist who adopts the disguise of a changeling” (70). The roots of this unorthodox self-definition are found in the depth psychology of Carl Jung. There are two central tenets of Jung’s philosophical system that range throughout Eiseley’s writing: the importance of the collective unconscious in shaping the structures of human intelligence and the essential dualism of human culture and experience.<br>

  Abstract: Nous pouvons observer un certain décalage entre la capacité de transformation sociale de l’innovation sociale et son traitement dans l’actualité politique. En effet, au sein de cette actualité, les innovations sociales ne sont pas traitées en tant qu’éléments clés de la construction d’un nouveau compromis. Pour élucider ce décalage de perceptions, nous ferons un détour du côté politique sans pour autant nous éloigner du champ scientifique.Nous pouvons citer à ce propos Paul Ricoeur selon lequel il n’y a que deux façons de faire des sciences sociales, soit en déniant ses présupposés normatifs et en les réintroduisant de manière subreptice, soit<br>

  Author(s): COLOMB VALÉRIE<br>
  Abstract: Qu’ils soient urbains, technologiques, environnementaux, sociaux, territoriaux, éducatifs, touristiques ou miniers, les grands projets produisent, portent, apportent, accompagnent ou subissent de nombreux changements. En réunissant des textes qui juxtaposent et entremêlent gestion de projet, sciences politiques, management, urbanisme, communication, tourisme, technologies de l’information, sciences de la Terre, gestion des connaissances et ingénierie, cet ouvrage propose un panorama de ces changements. Chercheurs et praticiens, tous passionnés par les défis de changement que représente la nouvelle ère de l’économie des idées, qui viendrait déjà, si vite, remplacer celle de l’économie du savoir, ont fait le choix d’investiguer, d’analyser et d’expliciter en quoi les grands projets sont synonymes de changements, comment les grands changements environnementaux, technologiques et sociaux frappent les grands projets ou encore quelles pratiques de gestion de projet ont changé sur le terrain. La première partie du livre aborde les changements d’environnements et leurs implications pour les grands projets ; la deuxième partie traite des changements de pratiques et de métiers pour les grands projets ; la troisième partie concerne les changements de perspectives théoriques ou intuitives ; la quatrième partie illustre les complexités inattendues ou indomptables que représentent les grands projets de changement. L’ensemble des textes invite à imaginer l’être-ensemble et le vivre-ensemble de demain, que l’on soit ici ou là, leader politique ou étudiant, urbain ou rural, gestionnaire ou consultant.<br>

  Book Title: Identité et multiplicité en ligne-  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): Perraton Charles<br>
  Abstract: On pourrait croire à tort que les internautes sont libres de se construire n’importe quelle identité, parce qu’ils n’auraient aucune contrainte physique dans le cyberespace. L’identité serait ainsi sortie de ses frontières pour permettre à chacun de créer et multiplier à sa guise autant d’identités qu’il le souhaite. Il ne faudrait toutefois pas conforter la croyance dans le sujet et dans l’idéologie de la représentation de laquelle il relève en centrant le questionnement sur l’identité. Sujet et identité vont en effet de pair avec une surestimation de la conscience et une conception idéaliste de la volonté qui pourrait être préjudiciable à la compréhension des grands enjeux liés à l’expérience de l’univers numérique. On le sait, la notion d’identité est d’une grande utilité pour caractériser et responsabiliser les individus dans les sociétés de contrôle. Elle permet aux autorités et aux gestionnaires de toutes sortes d’administrer les corps à distance ; elle permet aux organisations de profiter du numérique pour développer de nouveaux outils de profilage. Elle pourrait faire écran à la compréhension des véritables enjeux de l’expérience du cyberespace si on oublie de porter l’analyse sur les différents agencements auxquels ouvre l’expérience des mondes virtuels où se trouvent mobilisés les corps et les objets dans l’exploration de nouveaux territoires et l’invention de nouvelles formes de vie.<br>

  Abstract: Si la science politique s’est peu attardée à la notion de responsabilité, la philosophie quant à elle s’en préoccupe depuis plus de deux millénaires. La responsabilité demeure néanmoins difficile à cerner, puisqu’elle renvoie aux relations que les individus et les collectivités entretiennent avec les codes sociaux et moraux. Elle touche à la fois au droit, aux normes et à l’hésitation durable entre volonté individuelle et déterminisme socioculturel. L’objectif du présent chapitre est d’interroger la notion de responsabilité dans un cadre spécifique, soit celui de la violence envers les femmes.

  Book Title: L'écriture réflexive-Objet de recherche et de professionnalisation<br>
  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): CROS FRANÇOISE<br>
  Abstract: L’écriture réflexive comme outil de professionnalisation est un objet de recherche encore peu exploré. Pourtant, au vu de la pluralisation des écrits en milieux professionnels, considérés de plus en plus comme des moyens de penser et d’agir, l’analyse des particularités de cette écriture recèle des enjeux considérables. Quelles méthodes et quels outils conceptuels utiliser pour produire des connaissances sur l’écriture professionnelle ? Rares sont les chercheurs et chercheures qui analysent leurs propres orientations méthodologiques et théoriques et mettent en évidence leurs démarches de recherche. C’est pourtant le défi qui est relevé dans cet ouvrage. Fruit d’un travail collectif, les contributions, articulées à une synthèse théorique, visent à approfondir la notion de réflexivité. Elles présentent des applications de démarches de recherche dans le champ de la formation qui se sont déroulées en Belgique, au Québec, en France et en Suisse. La diversité et la rigueur des approches qui sont exposées, à la fois sur les plans théorique et méthodologique, conduisent à une métaanalyse des conditions de production par la recherche de savoirs nouveaux sur un objet. Ces nouvelles perspectives et ces réflexions élargies susciteront l’intérêt des chercheurs et chercheures ainsi que des étudiants et étudiantes en sciences humaines et sociales, qui y trouveront matière à alimenter leurs pratiques et leurs recherches.<br>

Taylor tells us that ‘from the beginning, the number one problem of modern social science has been modernity itself: that historically unprecedented amalgam of new practices and institutional forms (science, technology, industrial production, urbanization), of new ways of living (individualism, secularization, instrumental rationality); and of new forms of malaise (alienation, meaninglessness,<br>

  Chapter 2  THE SOCIOLOGICAL CHALLENGE OF REFLEXIVITY IN BOURDIEUSIAN THOUGHT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ffjq3f">The Anthem Companion to Pierre Bourdieu</a><br>
  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: The main purpose of this chapter is to examine Pierre Bourdieu’s conception of reflexivity. The concept of reflexivity plays a pivotal role in Bourdieu’s attempt to develop a ‘critical sociology’ (
                  sociologie critique), often referred to as ‘reflexive sociology’ in the Anglophone literature. Based on a thorough textual analysis of his key works, the chapter aims to demonstrate that the following twelve elements are particularly important to Bourdieu’s conception of reflexivity: (1) ‘science’, (2) ‘vigilance’, (3) ‘consciousness’, (4) ‘self-awareness’, (5) ‘critique’, (6) ‘self-objectification’, (7) ‘distance-taking’ (8) ‘rupture’, (9) ‘epistemology’, (10) ‘historicization’, (11) ‘understanding’ and (12) ‘emancipation’.

The co-authors proceeded to quote from Karl Marx and Max Weber to suggest that there was an epistemological principle articulated in the Saussurean statement that unified social science practice in spite of ideological differences, one that involves seeing science as ‘an instrument for breaking with naive realism’ ([1968], 1991, 33).

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kn1q">Transcendence and the Concrete</a><br>
  Author(s) Baugh Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Jean Wahl’s 1929 book,
                  Le malheur de la conscience dans la philosophie de Hegel, marked a turning point in French Hegel studies and profoundly influenced subsequent philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Hyppolite, Gilles Deleuze, and Jacques Derrida. Wahl’s was the first major French study of Hegel’sPhenomenology of Spirit(1807), marking a turn away from Hegel’s Science of Logic to the affective and experiential basis of Hegel’s dialectical method. For Wahl, the key chapter in thePhenomenologyis the section on “the Unhappy Consciousness,” rather than the earlier section on “master and slave,” which was the central focus of<br>

Its author was Alexandre Koyré. Although now principally known as a philosopher and historian of science, Koyré’s initial work was in the philosophy of religion; his thesis, on René Descartes’s proofs for the existence of God, was completed in 1922—two years after Jean Wahl’s own thesis on Descartes—and in 1929 he received hisdoctorat d’ état for La philosophie de Jakob Boehme(The philosophy<br>

  Abstract: God has died, at least in science and philosophy. He is agonizing in religious study, perhaps even in some divinity schools. Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

True, archaeology has come rather late in this field, which had already dominated the social sciences, anthropology, and feminist studies (Csordas 1994a){Csordas, 1994 #8978}{Csordas, 1994 #9578}{Csordas, 1994 #9578}.

  Abstract: Psychoanalysis may be viewed (following suggestions by Paul Ricoeur [1970] in
                     Freud and Philosophy) as a hermeneutics, specifically as a hermeneutics of desire. it traces or tracks the imprint of desire first in the dream and then in a variety of behavioral symptoms (jokes, slips of the tongue, as well as bodily symptoms). This hermeneutics is, however, never simple since desire is constitutionally conflicted, divided, deflected, and disguised. Thus desire is never only or primarily what it seems. it is constitutionally enigmatic. it is this that necessitates something like a science of desire, an analytics of desire.<br>

  Book Title: Science Fiction Double Feature-The Science Fiction Film as Cult Text<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUCHOVNAY GERALD<br>
  Abstract: Critical discussion of cult cinema has often noted its tendency to straddle or ignore boundaries, to pull together different sets of conventions, narrative formulas, or character types for the almost surreal pleasure to be found in their sudden juxtapositions or narrative combination. With its own boundary-blurring nature—as both science and fiction, reality and fantasy—science fiction has played a key role in such cinematic cult formation. This volume examines that largely unexplored relationship, looking at how the sf film’s own double nature neatly matches up with a persistent double vision common to the cult film. It does so by bringing together an international array of scholars to address key questions about the intersections of sf and cult cinema: how different genre elements, directors, and stars contribute to cult formation; what role fan activities, including “con" participation, play in cult development; and how the occulted or “bad" sf cult film works. The volume pursues these questions by addressing a variety of such sf cult works, including Robot Monster (1953), Zardoz (1974), A Boy and His Dog (1975), Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989), Space Truckers (1996), Ghost in the Shell 2 (2004), and Iron Sky (2012). What these essays afford is a revealing vision of both the sf aspects of much cult film activity and the cultish aspects of the whole sf genre.<br>

Perhaps we might better ask: can an animated film for adults, created within Japan for a Japanese audience, be considered anythingbutcult when it circulates in a non-Japanese context?¹ This essay will explore these questions en route to a consideration of the connections between the “cult” elements of the film and the science fiction-esque<br>

  Abstract: It is Jürgen Habermas (1981) himself who quite some time ago had challenged us that now we need a new philosophy of science which is not scientistic. It is worth asking Habermas, and all of us sociologists for whom sociological engagement is nothing more than an elaboration of the agenda of modernity, whether we need an understanding of and relationship with modernity which is not modernistic. This inquiry is at the core of understanding paths of civil society and experiments with modernities, not only in India but also in Europe, East Asia, Africa, Latin America and around the world.

  Abstract: The 1980s witnessed a remarkable change in the social sciences, a significant renewal of sociological theory. In France it was an occasion to discover and appreciate, albeit with significant delay, the contribution of Anglo-Saxon sociological currents which had earlier been dismissed or underestimated, such as symbolic interactionism, ethno-methodology, and phenomenological sociology. Through the 1960s and 1970s, French sociology was limited mainly to four major currents, which Alain Touraine proposed to call ‘the four corners of sociology’, represented by Raymond Boudon, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Crozier, and Alain Touraine himself.

Anyone who is not, or barely, familiar with Boltanski’s key contributions to the contemporary social sciences will find this chapter useful.

  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: In the contemporary sociological literature, not only in the Francophone² world but also in Germanophone³ and Anglophone⁴ contexts, the work of Luc Boltanski is widely recognized as a major contribution to the social sciences. The value and influence of Boltanski’s writings manifest themselves in the emergence of a new paradigm: the
                  sociology of critiqueor, as it has been recently characterized not only by sympathetic and unsympathetic critics alike but also by the author himself, thepragmatic sociology of critique.⁵ It is true that the concept of critique plays a pivotal role in most of Boltanski’s writings.⁶ His recent book<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpcqw">The Spirit of Luc Boltanski</a><br>
  Author(s) Nachi Mohamed<br>
  Abstract: The 1980s witnessed a remarkable change in the social sciences, a significant renewal of sociological theory. In France it was an occasion to discover and appreciate, albeit with significant delay, the contribution of Anglo-Saxon sociological currents which had earlier been dismissed or underestimated, such as symbolic interactionism, ethno-methodology, and phenomenological sociology. Through the 1960s and 1970s, French sociology was limited mainly to four major currents, which Alain Touraine proposed to call ‘the four corners of sociology’, represented by Raymond Boudon, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Crozier, and Alain Touraine himself. The debates in the social sciences during this period significantly turned around<br>

  Abstract: All scientific work starts with some simplification of basic concepts. Once these have been defined and established, we begin to pile up empirical variations. During this process, the simplifying notions are modified and, eventually, they may disappear. For example, economics assumes scarcity, and hence the need to rationalize and economize; politics presupposes the existence of struggles to maximize power; and sociology insists upon the necessity of social solidarity. Taking our cue from the etymology of socius , sociology is the science of companionship or friendship. For social science as a whole, civil society is the space in which these somewhat<br>

  Author(s) Turner Bryan S.<br>
  Abstract: All scientific work starts with some simplification of basic concepts. Once these have been defined and established, we begin to pile up empirical variations. During this process, the simplifying notions are modified and, eventually, they may disappear. For example, economics assumes scarcity, and hence the need to rationalize and economize; politics presupposes the existence of struggles to maximize power; and sociology insists upon the necessity of social solidarity. Taking our cue from the etymology of socius , sociology is the science of companionship or friendship. For social science as a whole, civil society is the space in which these somewhat<br>

  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: In the contemporary sociological literature, not only in the Francophone² world but also in Germanophone³ and Anglophone⁴ contexts, the work of Luc Boltanski is widely recognized as a major contribution to the social sciences. The value and influence of Boltanski’s writings manifest themselves in the emergence of a new paradigm: the
                  sociology of critiqueor, as it has been recently characterized not only by sympathetic and unsympathetic critics alike but also by the author himself, thepragmatic sociology of critique.⁵ It is true that the concept of critique plays a pivotal role in most of Boltanski’s writings.⁶ His recent book<br>

  Author(s) Nachi Mohamed<br>
  Abstract: The 1980s witnessed a remarkable change in the social sciences, a significant renewal of sociological theory. In France it was an occasion to discover and appreciate, albeit with significant delay, the contribution of Anglo-Saxon sociological currents which had earlier been dismissed or underestimated, such as symbolic interactionism, ethno-methodology, and phenomenological sociology. Through the 1960s and 1970s, French sociology was limited mainly to four major currents, which Alain Touraine proposed to call ‘the four corners of sociology’, represented by Raymond Boudon, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Crozier, and Alain Touraine himself. The debates in the social sciences during this period significantly turned around<br>

I am interested in how this relationship has changed, particularly over the last thirty years; I think that there may have been a significant change in this relationship. Before this period, there was the idea that social theory, or sociology, was somehow taking over questions of political philosophy and that political philosophy was even being superseded by approaches informed by the social sciences.

  Abstract: For lack of being able to offer here a systematic comparison between Bourdieu’s sociology and the thought of Durkheim – which would require an historicalanalytic monograph capable of reconstituting the double chain, social and intellectual, of the ramifying causations that link them to each other and to their respective milieu – I would like, by way of selective soundings, to bring out four of the pillars that support their common base: namely, (1) the fierce attachment to rationalism, (2) the refusal of pure theory and the stubborn defence of the undividedness of social science, (3) the relation to the historical<br>

  Author(s) Frère Bruno<br>
  Abstract: For nearly thirty years now, the critical sociology of Pierre Bourdieu has been used in an increasingly large number of studies in the social sciences. It is remarkable, however, that it has had a rather weak impact on my own field of research: the study of new social movements. This chapter argues that the reason for this anomaly lies with Bourdieu’s theory of habitus (a central element of Bourdieusian thought) and the particular problems that this theory poses for researchers of new social movements. As original and powerful as it can be, the theory of habitus is, first and foremost,<br>

  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

Ces approches accordent toutes une place centrale à l’analyse des pathologies sociales, que ce soit les inégalités économiques, les phénomènes de domination coloniale ou postcoloniale, la privation des droits politiques, le mépris à l’endroit des minorités culturelles, les maux du travail, les rapports de pouvoir de genre ou la surveillance de masse. Elles sont abordées ici par une quinzaine d’auteurs comme autant de ressources conceptuelles pour appréhender des objets de recherche communicationnels comme le journalisme, la propagande politique, la publicité politique, les médias sociaux, les industries culturelles ou les relations publiques. De quoi parle le théoricien critique ? Quelles sont les finalités des perspectives critiques ? Quels phénomènes sociaux, culturels, politiques ou économiques retiennent l’attention des chercheurs critiques ? Quelles sont les limites de ces approches ? Quelles formes prennent-elles ? Résolument pédagogique, cet ouvrage se donne pour triple objectif de contextualiser des constructions conceptuelles a priori peu accessibles, de les exposer clairement afin d’en faciliter l’appropriation, mais aussi de démontrer leur pertinence pour la réalisation de recherches empiriques dans le domaine de la communication.<br>

He notes that the eighteenth century was the century of psychology, the empirical science that enables “knowing oneself.”¹ He argues that the “science of the soul” grows out of the Aristotelian-Galenic tradition of the Renaissance, evidenced by the introduction of the termpsychologiaby Protestant Scholastics in the later sixteenth century. On the one hand, the Aristotelian tradition maintains that body and soul are a unity, whereas the Galenic emphasizes the importance of anatomy for understanding physiology, on the other.<br>

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new. Keywords in this volume include: Aboriginal, Accumulation, Addiction, Affect, America, Animal, Anthropocene, Architecture, Arctic, Automobile, Boom, Canada, Catastrophe, Change, Charcoal, China, Coal, Community, Corporation, Crisis, Dams, Demand, Detritus, Disaster, Ecology, Electricity, Embodiment, Ethics, Evolution, Exhaust, Fallout, Fiction, Fracking, Future, Gender, Green, Grids, Guilt, Identity, Image, Infrastructure, Innervation, Kerosene, Lebenskraft, Limits, Media, Metabolism, Middle East, Nature, Necessity, Networks, Nigeria, Nuclear, Petroviolence, Photography, Pipelines, Plastics, Renewable, Resilience, Risk, Roads, Rubber, Rural, Russia, Servers, Shame, Solar, Spill, Spiritual, Statistics, Surveillance, Sustainability, Tallow, Texas, Textiles, Utopia, Venezuela, Whaling, Wood, Work For a full list of keywords in and contributors to this volume, please go to: http://ow.ly/4mZZxV<br>

  Abstract: The world of British science fiction writer J. G. Ballard is one of motorways and cars; highways and automobiles emblematize changing technological landscapes and emergent postmodern geographies, betokening capitalism and Americanization. At the beginning of the 1970s, when the environmental effects of automobiles came under increasing scrutiny, another aspect of the car garnered attention: exhaust. A UTOMOBILE exhaust is a secondarily produced waste resulting from energetic depletion. Think of the car as a system: gasoline in the form of fuel drives the system and is required for it to function, but this energetic imperative and the burning of fuel transforms<br>

                  New York Timesarticle by Eduardo Porter about the possibility of FUTURE food shortages caused by climate destabilization. The opening question, “Might Thomas Malthus be vindicated in the end?,” invoked Malthus’sAn Essay on the Principle of Population, a treatise so bleak that it earned economics the nickname “the dismal science” (Porter 2014; Malthus 1993 [1798]; see also T. Carlyle 1889; Groenwegen 2001; Marglin 2010). Malthus’s premise was simple: because population increases exponentially, DEMAND for nourishment would outpace the supply of food, which grows only arithmetically.<br>

  Author(s) Kuzniar Alice<br>
  Abstract: In considering contemporary cultural discourse about ENERGY, we should not forget a different discursive usage in late-eighteenth-and early-nineteenth-century Germany, when the concept of
                  Kraft(power, energy, force) was current in the life sciences, referring to organic generative and regenerative processes.KraftandLebenskraft—a vital life force—accrued a range of meanings whose ultimate demise coincided with the technologization and instrumentalization of so-called natural resources—COAL and oil—used in powering life. It was as if the formerly inner, organic propulsion of life became exteriorized in the shift to fossil fuels: energy was generated from outside rather than from within<br>

  ONE  Transcendental Truth and Cultural Relativism: from:

  Abstract: That marvelous venture in cross-cultural study,
                  Eranos, devoted its 1951 meeting to the theme “Man and Time.”¹ When the papers given at this meeting were translated and published in English, they were introduced by a short essay, “The Time of Eranos,” by Henry Corbin.² In a few pages Corbin launched a frontal assault on some of the most cherished assumptions of the history profession—indeed, on the very idea of “explanation” as it occurs across the sciences today. His analysis seems to me so correct and freighted with such significance that I would like to devote this chapter to explaining,<br>

  SIX  The Middle Ages in the History of Toleration: from:

  Abstract: Though the Whig grand narrative of history on which most of us were brought up has been under attack for some time—witness the writings of Herbert Butterfield (1900–1979)—it continues to permeate our culture. Essentially at first a narrative to explain the gloriousness of the Glorious Revolution of 1688—that is, the triumph of Protestantism and parliamentarianism over Catholicism and monarchy—the narrative has been quite adaptive and has been a carrier of a tale of progress built around the desirability of commerce, money-making, science, technology, and democracy.

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: James O’Donnell has characterized Book 10 of the

The whole character of Augustine’s ethics as presented in this book is put in question for O’Donnell by the sudden transition from the luminous to the meticulous.

  Abstract: The Italian biotechnological sector has become a battlefield between the Catholic Church and the various actors who disagree with its positions. They represent various power and knowledge subsystems in a society which has become complex. The conflict also grows out of the paradox of a society – like the Italian – which is partly secularized but can still portray itself as majority Catholic. From the social point of view, Catholicism continues to be the
                  basso continuoof collective conscience, although among the Italian population many attitudes and behaviours in the field of faith and religious practice have deviated – either discreetly or decisively<br>

  Book Title: Sémiotique et vécu musical-Du sens à l'expérience, de l'expérience au sens<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reybrouck Mark<br>
  Abstract: Nouvelles perspectives en sémiotique. Tout est musique, et la musique nous accompagne partout : ces lieux communs n’ont jamais été si vrais qu’aujourd’hui, au temps de l’arrosage musical continuel. Cette ubiquité, loin d’être simplement une mode, nous oblige à repenser sémiotiquement la fonction et le fonctionnement de la musique. Les essais composant Sémiotique et vécu musical montrent dans quelle direction se dirigent les recherches de nos jours. L’analyse de l’expérience musicale, par exemple, détermine la réception affective, peut provoquer l’ébranlement intérieur, transformer le temps vécu, changer et déterminer les structures de l’expérience ainsi que l’expérientialité. L’expérience musicale est profondément liée à l’incarnation et à la corporalité. Elle peut redéfinir l’horizon de compréhension, moduler les attentes, déterminer et délimiter les contenus phénoménaux. Elle est fondamentalement conditionnée par l’interaction physique avec un instrument ou encore modelée par le studio d’enregistrement. L’intelligence artificielle et l’usage de robots dans des spectacles commencent à remettre en cause nos conceptions de l’expérience musicale. Ces nouvelles perspectives développées en sémiotique s’ouvrent nécessairement et impérativement aux sciences cognitives, aux nouvelles approches de la musicologie, à la transdisciplinarité et au transmédial. Le caractère innovant du présent ouvrage qui touche la théorie, la méthodologie et l’empirisme, témoigne de la vivacité, de l’inventivité et du dynamisme qui caractérisent la sémiotique toujours jeune, curieuse et surprenante.

  [Première partie Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jkts7v">Sémiotique et vécu musical</a><br>
  Abstract: Michel Imberty interroge le concept de narrativité qui fait fureur dans les sciences humaines, y compris en musicologie et en sémiotique musicale. Plutôt que de se mettre en ligne avec la tradition narratologique, il souligne le pouvoir heuristique des idées que ce concept subsume, en s’inspirant de l’analogie entre l’oeuvre musicale et le mythe. L’une comme l’autre développe chez l’auditeur ou le lecteur le même genre d’émotions et de sentiments, ce qui nous fait reconnaître que leur narrativité commune réside d’abord dans leur mode de progression dans le temps, relevant des mécanismes généraux de l’esprit et non de la syntaxe<br>

Nattiez et réactualisée de façon admirable par son ouvrage récent,La musique, les images et les mots(2010).

L’analyse de l’expérience musicale, par exemple, détermine la réception affective, peut provoquer l’ébranlement intérieur, transformer le temps vécu, changer et déterminer les structures de l’expérience ainsi que l’expérientialité. L’expérience musicale est profondément liée à l’incarnation et à la corporalité. Elle peut redéfinir l’horizon de compréhension, moduler les attentes, déterminer et délimiter les contenus phénoménaux. Elle est fondamentalement conditionnée par l’interaction physique avec un instrument ou encore modelée par le studio d’enregistrement.

  Abstract: Social science disciplines such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, education, and so on have long had an interest in narrative as a human cognitive and discursive device for sense-making and for ordering one’s life experiences. The underlying assumption is that narratives are “
                  social productsproduced by people within the context of specific social, historical and cultural locations. They are related to the experience that people have of their lives, but they are not transparent carriers of that experience. Rather, they are interpretive devices, through which people represent themselves, both to themselves and to others” (Lawler 2002: 242; emphasis in original). These<br>

  Abstract: In his 1925 book
                  Trois réformateurs(Three Reformers: Luther, Descartes, Rousseau), in the section devoted to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jacques Maritain denounced the modern fiction writer’s “shameless” claim to provide the reader with knowledge of the secret and innermost interiority of a human being’s “heart,” in the biblical sense of the term. Such knowledge of another’s heart, writes Maritain, is “hidden from the angels, and open only to the priestly knowledge [la science sacerdotale] of Christ.” Maritain continues: “A Freud to-day attempts to violate [these secrets] by psychological tricks. Christ looked into the eyes of the adulterous woman and pierced to<br>

  Abstract: Depuis bien des années, il m’est arrivé de m’arrêter réfléchir sur le rôle de l’incohérence en littérature, de manière discontinue et sans grande profondeur, comme si j’étais accompagné par une ombre qui m’était familière et dont j’avais conscience, mais une connaissance réduite. À chaque nouvelle lecture d’un roman, je revenais sur la question qui, en réalité, se posait à l’époque non comme une incohérence, mais positivement comme l’« évaluation esthétique de la cohérence ». Cette « perception de l’ombre » se manifestait sous forme d’un rappel obscur et désagréable : il me semblait que quelque chose d’essentiel m’avait échappé dans<br>

  Book Title: Le chercheur face aux défis méthodologiques de la recherche-Freins et leviers<br>
  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): VAN DER MAREN JEAN-MARIE<br>
  Abstract: Les chercheurs, qu’ils soient séniors ou à leurs premières armes en recherche, font face à de nombreux défis. De nature réflexive, le pré­sent ouvrage veut les outiller en explorant des freins et des leviers rencontrés par des chercheurs de formations et disciplines diverses, en sciences humaines et sociales. Compte tenu de la variété d’angles présentés pour aborder certains défis et de la diversité des expériences vécues par les auteurs, il offre un éclairage original sur des défis à prendre en considération durant la réalisation d’une recherche. Cet ouvrage constitue une importante source d’information et de réflexion sur le vaste domaine du processus rigoureux de la re­cherche. Il s’adresse autant aux étudiants et au corps professoral qu’à toutes les personnes préoccupées par la question des choix méthodologiques.<br>

  Abstract: Tout chercheur est appelé à relever constamment le défi de l’objectivité de sa démarche. Dans le champ qui nous occupe, soit celui des sciences de l’éducation, ce défi donne matière à réflexion : quels en sont les fondements ? Comment le chercheur doit-il l’aborder ? Quelles sont les stratégies possibles pour le surmonter ? L’objectivité peut-elle prendre différentes formes ?<br>

  Abstract: Partant d’une recherche commanditée sur le thème de la persévérance scolaire, ce chapitre souhaite faire prendre conscience au lecteur des défis qui le guettent dès le début d’une étude. En les connaissant, il pourra les éviter le mieux possible, voire les relever, pour faciliter la bonne marche du processus empirique. Afin d’offrir au lecteur le panorama le plus complet possible, une démarche en quatre temps est proposée. Dans un premier temps, à partir de deux ouvrages et d’un travail de recherche, les défis typiques relatifs à une étude seront mis en évidence. Suivra la description même de la recherche (Gendron<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1mf6z2q">Le chercheur face aux défis méthodologiques de la recherche</a><br>
  Author(s) Grégoire Pascal<br>
  Abstract: Les méthodes de recherche mixtes sont de plus en plus connues et utilisées dans la recherche en sciences humaines, sociales et de la santé (Briand et Larivière, 2014). Ces méthodes s’inscrivent dans un troisième paradigme de recherche, qui allie composants qualitatifs et quantitatifs au sein d’une même étude (Creswell et Plano Clark, 2011). Les méthodes de recherche mixtes découlent de l’idée de la triangulation des résultats de recherche, par laquelle on combine différents résultats d’expérimentation afin de mieux cerner un phénomène et d’assurer la validité des conclusions (Briand et Larivière, 2014). Ce chapitre vise, d’une part, à définir trois types<br>

  4  Romanticism with the Machine (1): from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1mtz81z">New Romantic Cyborgs</a><br>
  Abstract: Romanticism is not necessarily hostile to science and technology. In chapter 2 I mentioned Novalis’s ideas about “magic science”—the view that Romantic philosophy aspired to a synthesis rather than a rejection of science and technology—and of course Gothic literature such as Mary Shelley’s, which was informed by and commented on science and technology and should not be reduced to a simple rejection of technology. In chapter 3 I also suggested that romanticism is not necessarily opposed to technology. In this chapter, I develop this line of thought and engage with histories of science to show how Romanticism is<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npfbd">The Enlightenment and the Intellectual Foundations of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: The success of the physical and mathematical sciences inspired a demand for a science of human nature. Not only would a systematic knowledge of the person round out the circle of sciences, but, as Hume understood it, such a knowledge would place all other sciences on a secure basis. “It is evident that all the sciences have a relation, greater or less, to human nature; and that, however wide any of them may seem to run from it, they still return by one passage or another.

  Book Title: Simplexity-Simplifying Principles for a Complex World'<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Giselle<br>
  Abstract: In a sense, the history of living organisms may be summed up by their remarkable ability to find solutions that avoid the world's complexity by imposing on it their own rules and functions. Evolution has resolved the problem of complexity not by simplifying but by finding solutions whose processes-though they can sometimes be complex-allow us to act in the midst of complexity and of uncertainty. Nature can inspire us by making us realize that simplification is never simple and requires instead that we choose, refuse, connect, and imagine, in order to act in the best possible manner. Such solutions are already being applied in design and engineering and are significant in biology, medicine, economics, and the behavioral sciences.<br>

  Abstract: Our analysis of simplexity is guided by the central idea that not only action but also the
                  act(a much broader concept, which I have discussed in several previous books) must be at the center of all analysis of the functioning of living organisms. To act, the perceiving brain relies on simplifying principles. Psychology and the neurosciences have now established profound links between perception and action. For this reason, I have introduced the termpercactionin my courses at the Collège de France. The simplifying principles, too, link perception to action.

  Abstract: Examining the concept of simplexity applied to life reveals an exceptional wealth of simplex mechanisms that have appeared over the course of evolution. We have proposed a number of principles as the basis of a theory of simplexity: the fundamental role of inhibition, specialization and modularity, anticipation, detours, cooperation, and redundancy. We suspect there are others. However, it is clear that we have only begun to glimpse the fundamental biological mechanisms that enabled simplexity to emerge in life. Those are for future science to decipher. Our investigation leads to a compelling conclusion. We can understand nothing about life if we<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Ways In and Out of the Hermeneutic Circle from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npkg4">Theory of Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: Despite the intimidating sound of the word, “hermeneutics” is easily defined as the science of interpretation. You would think hermeneutics had always been a matter of interest, but in fact it’s of continuous interest only fairly recently. Aristotle did write a treatise called
                     De Interpretatione, and the Middle Ages were much concerned with interpretation, so I suppose what I’m saying in part is that the word “hermeneutics” wasn’t then available; but it’s also true that at many times the idea that there ought to be a systematic study of how we interpret things wasn’t a matter of pressing concern.<br>

  3  TEXT AND INTERPRETATION INFINITIES IN KABBALAH from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn1r">Absorbing Perfections</a><br>
  Abstract: The suppression of some conceptual elements and forms of discourse already found in ancient Jewish circles is characteristic of the rather homogeneous type of rabbinic discourse. Though allowing divergences of opinion and, one may even claim, encouraging, preserving, and studying them for generations, the ancient rabbis nevertheless controlled the nature of the topics on which divergences are allowed. No allegorical or symbolic interpretations of the Bible, abundant as they were in Alexandrian Judaism (especially Philo), were given access to the exegetical methods characteristic of rabbinic literature. Alchemy, astrology, philosophy, and physical sciences remained at the margin of rabbinic discourse. A<br>

  Book Title: The Good, the True, and the Beautiful-A Neuronal Approach<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garey Laurence<br>
  Abstract: Changeux's book draws on Plato's notion that the Good, the True, and the Beautiful are celestial essences or ideas, independent but so intertwined as to be inseparable. Placing these essences within the characteristic features of the human brain's neuronal organization, the author addresses unsolved questions in neuroscience today. With imagination and deep insight, Changeux illuminates the evolution of the brain and deciphers what new developments in neuroscience may portend for the future of humanity.<br>

  II  The Good: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn3q">The Good, the True, and the Beautiful</a><br>
  Abstract: Since David Hume (1711–1776), philosophy, as well as common sense, has differentiated science from morality. Science establishes facts (“what is”), whereas morality decides “what should be,” but many admit that we cannot distinguish what should be from what is. I shall consider whether it is plausible to take an opposite, although perhaps rather surprising, approach and ask whether we can favor what should be from our knowledge about what is. In fact, such a question belongs to a long philosophical tradition, including Hume, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, and contemporary ethologists. My idea is to<br>

  IV  The Molecular Biology of the Brain from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn3q">The Good, the True, and the Beautiful</a><br>
  Abstract: Before science developed, humans elaborated mythical reflections to give some meaning to events and experiences they encountered and to establish classifications that were “superior to chaos,” as Claude Lévi-Strauss said. Theories included creation by gods and spontaneous generation. Common concepts included great floods to punish sins and re-create the world, and creation of life in a primeval ocean by successive steps. In the West the myth of dualism of body and soul emerged. The dualist, creationist view was opposed from ancient Greece onward by more materialist concepts, some of which emphasized that diverse elements could be combined randomly to form<br>

  VII  Epilogue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn3q">The Good, the True, and the Beautiful</a><br>
  Abstract: Recent progress in neuroscience and its integration in dynamic evolutionary processes, which include culture and its history, prompt us to rethink certain central philosophical questions, such as the significance of death. Death is an essential biological phenomenon directly related to the evolution of species. It has taken on a special dimension in the history of humanity. Buff on rightly said that “death is as natural as life.” Many philosophical and religious fundamentals, which emphasize the sacred character of life, maintain the balance by doing the same for its interruption by death. I feel it is opportune today more than ever<br>

  Abstract: 1.

  5  Constitution of the Spiritual World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npzng">Edmund Husserl's Freiburg Years</a><br>
  Abstract: Mind (or what Husserl calls
                     Seele) is, according to him, very different from spirit (orGeist). This distinction between mind and spirit—we have to keep in mind that mind is a part of Nature—corresponds to the distinction between natural sciences and sciences of spirit (Geisteswissenschaften, also translated as human sciences or humanities). Whereas scientific psychology studies the mind as a part of nature, the sciences of spirit would include a doctrine of personality or “egology” and a theory of society.<br>

For example, slavery in the United States is said to have left a “stain” upon our hands that still awaits “cleansing.” To speak in this fashion is to assume that sin is much more than a violation of a moral norm and that the effects of sin are more extensive than a guilty conscience. A verbal declaration of regret may be fine, but the way a culture grapples with the enduring legacy of sin is another<br>

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

  Abstract: In his book

This tension betweentheoryandpracticewas also evident when the new interest in practical wisdom (phronesis), which occurred in the carnival-like scientific atmosphere of the sixteenth century, with its focus on concrete, practical life and time-bound local practices, was supplanted around 1630 by an abstract and universalistic scientific paradigm, which instead took as its point of departure theoretical understanding (episteme).<br>

  Abstract: Last night i watched—mesmerized, despite its near three-hour length—Andrei Tarkovsky’s film
                     Stalker, a minimalist science fiction epic set in a dreary, bombed-out industrial wasteland. The title does not derive from the contemporary connotation of the sexual predator, but goes back to the sort of guide who leads hunters to where game can be found. In fact, the script deliberately associates its stalker with the James Fenimore Cooper character Natty Bumppo, who is known as “Deerstalker.”<br>

  Book Title: The Cruft of Fiction-Mega-Novels and the Science of Paying Attention<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): LETZLER DAVID<br>
  Abstract: What is the strange appeal of big books? The mega-novel, a genre of erudite tomes with encyclopedic scope, has attracted wildly varied responses, from fanatical devotion to trenchant criticism. Looking at intimidating mega-novel masterpieces from
         The Making of Americansto2666, David Letzler explores reader responses to all the seemingly random, irrelevant, pointless, and derailing elements that comprise these mega-novels, elements that he labels "cruft" after the computer science term for junk code. InThe Cruft of Fiction, Letzler suggests that these books are useful tools to help us understand the relationship between reading and attention.<br>

  Abstract: Having in the last chapter treated “information” in its technical sense, this chapter will treat the more colloquial use of the word by examining a mega-novel subgenre drawing on a different type of reference work, the encyclopedic novel. That term has been frequently used over the past six decades to refer to mega-novels that incorporate substantial specialized information from the sciences, the arts, and history.¹ Most famously Edward Mendelson defined encyclopedic narratives as those that “attempt to render the full range of knowledge and beliefs of a national culture,” echoing Northrop Frye’s earlier claim that encyclopedic fiction presents “a total<br>

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects. Contributors include Raymond Bellour (École des hautes études en sciences sociales), Monika Kin Gagnon (Concordia University), Beate Ochsner (University of Mannheim -Universität Mannheim), Claudette Lauzon (McGill University), David Tomas (Université du Québec à Montréal), Slavoj Zizek (Ljubljiana University and University of London), Marie Fraser (Université du Québec à Montréal), Alice Ming Wai Jim (Concordia University), Julie Lavigne (Université du Québec à Montréal), Amelia Jones (University of Manchester), Eric Michaud (École des hautes études en sciences sociales), Hélène Samson (McCord Museum), and Thierry Bardini (Université de Montréal).<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt43v">The Priority of Injustice</a><br>
  Abstract: What is theory good for? Theories are things we argue with. They provide the resources for making validity claims, for drawing inferences, and for constructing generalizations. Arguing with the help of theory is a means of engaging in reasoned debate. And theories are things we use to score points in the midst of an argument. But theories are also things we argue with in another sense, insofar as argument entails passionate, sometimes unreasonable disagreement. Theories can make us angry and invite criticism, if not outright dismissal, because they unsettle our most cherished thoughts. In the social sciences and humanities, arguments<br>

  Abstract: The goals of medicine have become a focus for debate in the world of medicine today. But thorough reflection on recent developments in health care and medicine is necessary to understand the significance of this discussion. Many changes have taken place in recent years. For example, the demographics of disease have changed markedly with advances in biomedical science and public health. Remarkable progress has been made in medical technology. In developed countries, chronic and degenerative diseases and aging have become major problems threatening people’s health. Consequently, they are experiencing a continuous rise in the cost of health care which results<br>

  Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has much in common with other forms of so-called traditional medicine, but it is also unique. It has its own theoretical system and terminology. It can also guide clinical practice effectively. The development of modern science and technology is the primary cause for the evolution from ancient Greco-Roman forms of traditional medicine to modern medicine. Most traditional medicine could not accommodate science and technology, and were largely overcome by it. Only TCM met this challenge, arming itself to prove its efficacy and the validity of its philosophy.¹ Over time, hundreds of modern doctors and professors who<br>

  Author(s) Lolas Fernando<br>
  Abstract: Defining medicine as a discipline and as a profession, requires a recognition that it comprises theory, and not merely practice.¹ The conceptualization of suffering and disease in secular terms, for example, has been one of the most pervasive theoretical aims of medicine throughout history. In addition, as a proto-paradigmatic discipline, medicine has been influenced by the science of the positivistic era, which may be said to have the inherent goal of reproducing itself and achieving autonomy as a techno-scientific enterprise. Therefore, as a scientific discipline, modern medicine shares with the sciences the goals of innovation and invention, aside from its<br>

  Abstract: La presente Tesis estudia las relaciones entre la ciencia y la poesía. Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought. The hypotheses of investigation rest on two levels of Lorand Gaspar’s writing: the epistemological dimension and the cognitive value of the poetic discourse. Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation. Three theoretical chapters organize the investigation of some of the processes of the poetical thought: Perception, Emotion and Metaphor. This research takes place in an argumentation that favors transdisciplinarity by means of literary analysis strategies, which integrate several considerations of interdisciplinary nature.Cette Thèse s’articule autour des relations entre la poésie et la science.

Based on the popular books, the

It was exported to Brussels at the same time, and acknowledged by the EU in 1994 (the poverty programme being renamed Programme Against Exclusion).

  Book Title: Biographical methods and professional practice-An international perspective<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Apitzsch Ursula<br>
  Abstract: The turn to biographical methods in social science is invigorating the relationship between policy and practice. This book shows how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the development of professionals, and promote more meaningful practitioner - service user relationships.This book uses a range of interpretive approaches to reveal the dynamics of service users' and professionals' individual experiences and life-worlds. From their research the contributors show how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the learning and development of professionals, and promote more meaningful and creative practitioner - service user relationships. The book: · reviews applications of biographical methods in both policy and practice in a range of professional contexts, from health and social care to education and employment; · explores the impact of social change in three main arenas - transformation from Eastern to Western types of society in Europe, major shifts in social and welfare principles, experiences of immigration and of new cultural diversities - on professional practice; · critically evaluates subjective and reflexive processes in interactions between researchers, practitioners and users of services; · considers the institutional arrangements and cultural contexts which support effective and sensitive interventions; · draws on actual projects and tracks reflection, progress and outcomes. With contributions from leading international experts, it provides a valuable comparative perspective. Researchers, policy analysts and practitioners, postgraduate students, teachers and trainers will find this book a stimulating read.<br>

  Abstract: What this volume demonstrates, as did
                  The turn to biographical methods in social science(Chamberlayne et al, 2000), is that there are undoubted benefits in research with people who are different to you in terms of widening perspectives and horizons. When language is a barrier to communication, many researchers and service providers employ translators and interpreters to try to harvest these benefits. However, ensuring that perspectives other than that of the researcher can be heard is not a straightforward task. In this chapter, I am interested in the implications, when translating, of Spivak’s (1993, p 189) call to “discriminate on<br>

  Book Title: Antropologia-  Publisher: John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Faculty of Philosophy<br>
  Author(s): JANECZEK Ks. Stanisław<br>
  Abstract: Antropologia [Anthropology] is a gateway to the series of volumes devoted to particular disciplines of philosophy, taking into account their relationship with the Christian worldview and recognizing the need to include the philosophical and ideological diversity of contemporary culture. Antropologia covers Thomist tradition, enriching its achievements with other perspectives, especially Karol Wojtyla's personalism. Increasing influence of "third culture thinking", where the humanities are carried out in the context of the natural sciences, justifies the need to take up the difficult task of demonstrating complex problems of philosophical and natural anthropology. Anthropological considerations force us to realize the multifaceted nature of classical discussions on the nature of man, including theirs scientific and ideological facets, and to demonstrate them in a well-balanced manner. In this context, it enables readers to gain guidance in the debate on the philosophy of mind, providing ways of understanding and assessing the problem of the human soul (concerning the mind-body problem).<br>

  Abstract: While studying Vietnamese intellectuals of the colonial era, I was struck by what an extraordinarily dynamic period it was, not only in terms of art and literature (fairly well documented already) but also in the intellectual and scientific spheres. My thesis (titled “The Beginnings of Anthropology in Vietnam: A Study of First-Generation Authors”) therefore sought to answer the following question: Under which conditions and with what results did the science of anthropology enter Vietnam? It was far from self-evident that this science, still in its infancy, should be of interest to Vietnamese thinkers, considering the Institut d’Ethnologie (at the Sorbonne<br>

  Book Title: Ethnographica Moralia-Experiments in Interpretive Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marcus George E.<br>
  Abstract: Panourgia and Marcus bring together anthropologists working in various parts of the world (Greece, Bali, Taiwan, the United States) with classicists, historians, and scholars in cultural studies. The volume takes into account global realities such as 9/11 and the opening of the Cypriot Green Line and explores the different ways in which Geertz’s anthropology has shaped the pedagogy of their disciplines and enabled discussions among them. Focusing on place and time, locations and temporalities, the essays in this volume interrogate the fixity of interpretation and open new spaces of inquiry. The volume addresses a wide audience from the humanities and the social sciences—anyone interested in the development of a new humanism that will relocate the human as a subject of social action.<br>

  Abstract: From the
                  Logical Investigationsto theCartesian Meditations, Husserl always saw in phenomenology a new “critique of reason,” giving himself the task of “the elucidation of knowledge”¹—the title of the sixthInvestigation—redefining it later, in the transcendental perspective developed in theParis Lecturesin 1929, as a “theory of knowledge.”² Beyond this essential definition of phenomenology as phenomenology of knowledge, the permanence of the theme of the foundation (Fundierung) of the formal sciences must be underlined, as we see it throughout Husserl’s entire itinerary, from thePhilosophy of Arithmetic to Experience and Judgment via the Logical Investigationsand<br>

                  Ideas I, Husserl defines phenomenology as “the science of beginnings”—that is, as the resumption of the original idea of philosophy, found in Plato, as a “universal science.”¹ The idea of philosophy for Husserl is, and will be to the end, the idea of a rigorous science, as indicated by the title of the famous 1911 article “Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft” (Philosophy as Rigorous Science).² As a “universal science” and a “rigorous science,” philosophy is radically distinct from every positive science and, as Husserl already said inThe Idea of Phenomenology<br>

  Abstract: Genetic epistemology, as I have argued, is not some kind of cleverly disguised genetic psychology. It is precisely what its name indicates-an epistemology oriented towards the genesis and development of knowledge. But as we have seen, it has a complex domain, including the growth of knowledge both in the individual person and in the history of science. As such, it is not merely an epistemology but also a philosophy of science. For, after all, if the philosophy of science is taken to be the epistemology of science-an assumption widely accepted-and if genetic epistemology is concerned with the epistemology of scientific<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Further Antinomies of Dreams, Dreaming, and Dream Research from:

  Abstract: Having set out the superordinate dimensions of our analysiscognitive science versus organismic—holistic cognition, Freud versus Jung, representational versus presentational symbolism, and causal process versus meaning—we complete our review of the literature by considering the more specific antinomies of current dream research. Each side of these contrasting dimensions is supported by important research findings and consistent theory. This in itself may illustrate the actual multiplicity of the processes of dreaming. It is equally important to locate whatever syntheses are afforded by this material and to understand them as necessarily provisional and temporary-both because of the open-ended and indeterminate nature<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sfz">The Multiplicity of Dreams</a><br>
  Abstract: It is fascinating how often ostensibly empirical debates in the human sciences actually rest on largely unarticulated philosophical antinomies. So it is that within cognitive approaches to dreaming we find intimations of a hidden and very old agenda. Does an empirically based account of dreaming require a theory of constructive imagination—with its roots in the idealist/romanticist tradition of Western thought? Or rather does it afford yet another opportunity to demonstrate that all imagination is really just a complex form of memory and learning-an extension of the rationalist and reductionist attempt, now computerized, to understand the complex in terms of<br>

  CHAPTER 13  Dreaming: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sfz">The Multiplicity of Dreams</a><br>
  Abstract: In beginning an overview of dreaming we could do worse than return to the nineteenth-century dream phenomenologists—who at least knew what later laboratory researchers and clinicians I I have forgotten, that description and classification are primary in science. DuPrel, Schemer, and Saint-Denys anticipated recent rating systems of dream bizarreness by calling attention to the positive and negative sides of dreaming. Dreaming tends always toward a delirium syndrome, but the corresponding impairment of verbal-reflective thinking allows a positive release of visual-spatial metaphor and intuition, the frames or modules of mind that are based on a relative simultaneity of expression.

  Abstract: It is fascinating how often ostensibly empirical debates in the human sciences actually rest on largely unarticulated philosophical antinomies. So it is that within cognitive approaches to dreaming we find intimations of a hidden and very old agenda. Does an empirically based account of dreaming require a theory of constructive imagination—with its roots in the idealist/romanticist tradition of Western thought?

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remained in the USA.<br>

  Abstract: In der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus wurden 130.000 bis 150.000 ÖsterreicherInnen aus „rassischen“ oder politischen Gründen zur Emigration gezwungen, die überwiegende Mehrheit davon Juden (Stadler, „Emigration“ 17). Schon lange vor der Machtübernahme des Nationalsozialismus hatten viele junge ForscherInnen jüdischer Herkunft und/oder linker politischer Gesinnung Österreich verlassen, da ihnen seit Anfang der 1920er Jahre Berufslaufbahnen an den Universitäten zusehends verwehrt wurden (Feichtinger, „Braindrain“ 286-98; Taschwer 99-132). Auswanderung und Vertreibung zerstörten nicht nur die lebendige Wissenschaftskultur Österreichs zur Jahrhundertwende, sie hinterließen auch eine gravierende personelle Lücke in der Zweiten Republik: „A noticeable characteristic of Austrian science is the great shortage of scientific workers<br>

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

  Abstract: Anna’s night journey to St. Petersburg (part 1, chapter 29) is one of the great transitional moments in her drama. Her experience dramatizes a state of intense moral and psychological conflict in which a powerful passion crashes through a barrier of will and conscience. Tolstoy’s account of this internal experience is remarkable for its representation of Anna’s epic crisis. The battle engages her entire being, physical, psychological, moral, and spiritual, drawing in her immediate surroundings and nature in the broadest sense of the term.<br>

A prior school has to be razed and then a new one erected on the same spot, with the “school board” quickly forgetting the attractions and the still usable space of the now nonexistent building.

  Abstract: SINCE THE FALL of the Iron Curtain in the late 1980s, the movement of people is a central topic of concern, among the citizenry, among politicians, and among scholars in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union. The intense debate about people’s ability to move and the transfer of goods and ideas and about ways to deal with unregulated migration reflects a complex web of movements and their assigned meanings.

  Book Title: Music and Embodied Cognition-Listening, Moving, Feeling, and Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): COX ARNIE<br>
  Abstract: Taking a cognitive approach to musical meaning, Arnie Cox explores embodied experiences of hearing music as those that move us both consciously and unconsciously. In this pioneering study that draws on neuroscience and music theory, phenomenology and cognitive science, Cox advances his theory of the "mimetic hypothesis," the notion that a large part of our experience and understanding of music involves an embodied imitation in the listener of bodily motions and exertions that are involved in producing music. Through an often unconscious imitation of action and sound, we feel the music as it moves and grows. With applications to tonal and post-tonal Western classical music, to Western vernacular music, and to non-Western music, Cox's work stands to expand the range of phenomena that can be explained by the role of sensory, motor, and affective aspects of human experience and cognition.<br>

  Abstract: Observers of American popular culture may recognize Genesis 1-3 as a text hotly defended by scientific creationists who want the “biblical account of creation” to be taught alongside evolutionary theories in the public schools. Long before Genesis 1-3 sparked debates about the teaching of science, however, interpreters were turning to—and arguing about—other foundational issues raised by the text. For centuries, the biblical account of creation has prompted readers to propose very different notions about what it means to be a man or to be a woman.<br>

  Abstract: There is a strong feeling that the multitudinous traditional ways of making and creativity are slowly being absorbed into one dominant way of making and thinking. This process of homogenization is not new, but it has reached unprecedented levels today. To see the difference, it is enough to recall the nature and the depth of discussions, in the early decades of the present century, about creativity in different domains of culture, about the relation between art and science or technology, about the nature and status of the applied arts, industrial design, and so on – in such movements, for example,<br>

  Book Title: Desi Divas-Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Desi Divas: Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performancesis the product of five years of field research with progressive activists associated with the School for Indian Languages and Cultures (SILC), South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), the feminist dance collective Post Natyam, and the grassroots feminist political organization South Asian Sisters. Christine L. Garlough explores how traditional cultural forms may be critically appropriated by marginalized groups and used as rhetorical tools to promote deliberation and debate, spur understanding and connection, broaden political engagement, and advance particular social identities. Within this framework she examines how these performance activists advocate a political commitment to both justice and care, to both deliberative discussion and deeper understanding. To consider how this might happen in diasporic performance contexts, Garlough weaves together two lines of thinking. One grows from feminist theory and draws upon a core literature concerning the ethics of care. The other comes from rhetoric, philosophy, and political science literature on recognition and acknowledgment. This dual approach is used to reflect upon South Asian American women's performances that address pressing social problems related to gender inequality, immigration rights, ethnic stereotyping, hate crimes, and religious violence.<br>

We can think of Cardinal Newman’s eloquent essay on the “Idea of a University” (1852) in which he drew the line between a purely professional education and a “universitary” one, that is, a “gentlemanly” and gratuitous formation of the mind by the synthesis of values and fundamental knowledge, a mind that could in turn be used everywhere and anyhow.¹ Three quarters of a century later Friedrich Gundolf explained wittily how Shakespeare’s

  Abstract: We shall now describe the humanistic disciplines, beginning with language. “If language is the essential thing that makes us human beings, linguistics ought to be considered, to an eminent degree, as a science of man, and, therefore, as a humanistic discipline, perhaps the most genuine of them all.”¹ These words by the Swedish linguist Bertil Malmberg present a thesis, but his defensive tone (“ought to be considered”) indicates that the idea is not universally shared. Linguistics is indeed a humanistic discipline, but not all branches of linguistics use the humanistic discourse. On the basis of the distinction between the nucleus<br>

  IV  Man: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x5t">The Humanities in the Age of Technology</a><br>
  Abstract: All disciplines are founded on a basic one, the theory of knowledge, which is in turn founded on a primordial root: the human being who lives and dies, and investigates how to live and what he can expect after death. Man is an abbreviated world, a physical body like the stone, vegetative like the pine tree, sensitive like the animals, and on top of all this, endowed with reason. Man can be studied from all of these perspectives: his biochemistry, heritage, genome, and behavior. When the natural sciences, especially biology, study man, they approach him as another natural being, not<br>

  V  The Crisis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x5t">The Humanities in the Age of Technology</a><br>
  Abstract: The crisis of the humanities has two basic aspects, one that is specific to the humanistic disciplines, and a second one that extends to a general crisis of values, culture, and education. In the specific area, the humanities were never the most important branch in the European university. Until the eighteenth century they were grouped together with the sciences in the Faculty of Arts, which was the equivalent of modern high school, where the student obtained the basic preparation for the lucrative schools: theology, law, and medicine. In all of Europe schools of engineering and of technical studies were founded<br>

  1  The Resilience Perspective from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: At every level of society, particular situations make or break the lives of children, adolescents, and adults—situations of violence, loss, indifference, and hatred. Some human beings cope well when faced with them, and others do not. Specialists call this capacity to do well in adversity “resilience.” Psychosocial research has documented three types of resilience phenomena: good outcomes in the midst of high risk (coping), sustained competence under stress (constancy), and recovery from trauma (constructing).² In order to track these resilience phenomena, researchers have changed their perspectives and methods.³ Moral theologians can benefit from these sciences’ insights into how humans<br>

  Abstract: The existential bridge that allows us to relate the psychosocial sciences and St. Thomas’s virtue theory is not only the reality of difficulty, but also the resourcefulness needed to overcome it, that is, the individual and social capacities to cope with difficulty, to resist destruction under hardship, and to construct something positive out of an otherwise negative situation. Both the virtue of fortitude (with its associated virtues of initiative and endurance) and resilience (as concept, phenomenon, and practice) relate to difficulty. Both fortitude and resilience contribute to a fundamentally positive perspective that counters an excessive focus on brokenness, vice, and<br>

We could throw darts at A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man for evidence. Throughout chapter 3, and after, Stephen’s young conscience is haunted and enchanted by a preacher’s description of Satan’s sin: “an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect” (A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, 133), “the sin of pride, the sinful thought conceived in an instant: non serviam” (P, 117).

  Abstract: The nature of nationalist movements and how to address them became key issues of world politics with the end of the cold war in the three-year period 1989 to 1991, and have remained so through the 1990s and into the new century. They are important issues both for social science theory and for practical politics. Among the variety of themes encompassed by the term

  Abstract: Given his preoccupation with logic in the 
                  Critique of Pure Reason, it is an understandable hope that Kant might use the term “logic” in a clear-cut, univocal fashion throughout the text. Unfortunately, such a hope is mere fantasy; Kant uses the term in a bewildering variety of ways, at times making it close to impossible to determine whether he is referring to (among others) general logic, transcendental logic, transcendental analytic, a “special” logic relative to a specific science, a “natural” logic, a logic intended for the “learned” (Gelehrter), some hybrid of these logics, or even some still more abstract notion<br>

  Book Title: Negotiating the Sacred-Blasphemy and Sacrilege in a Multicultural Society<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): WHITE KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism. The book will appeal to both those actively involved in religious negotiation and to scholars and students of religion in history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and political science.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbjs3">Origins, Ancestry and Alliance</a><br>
  Author(s) Sather Clifford<br>
  Abstract: The characterization of societies as ʺegalitarianʺ — in Borneo as elsewhere in the non-Western world — has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years (Boehm 1993; Flanagan and Rayner 1988; Flanagan 1989; Woodburn 1982). Even so, despite this newfound interest, compared to ʺhierarchyʺ, notions of equality have been far less explored in the anthropological literature. Part of the reason is almost certainly as Flanagan (1989:261) suggests: that equality tends to be ʺnaturalizedʺ in the social sciences and so regarded as the proto-cultural condition out of which structures of inequality are presumed to have developed by evolutionary differentiation (cf. Fried 1967).<br>

  Abstract: In the late summer and early autumn of 1936, Harvard University celebrated its tercentenary.¹ The timing could hardly have been more inauspicious. Americans were mired in an unprecedented economic downturn; a fascist coup against the democratic government in Spain threatened to spark an international conflagration; Nazi Germany stood emboldened by its seizure of the Rhineland; and the grim show trials of Stalin’s political opponents were opening in Moscow.

Neither Rudolf Carnap’s program of the Logic of Science nor Otto Neurath’s grandiose attempts to orchestrate a working alliance of the sciences registered strongly at Depression-era Harvard. Nevertheless, as S. S. Stevens’s organization of the Science of Science Discussion Group made clear, members of Harvard’s interstitial academy were deeply concerned with matters of cross-disciplinary communication and coordination. This was evident from Quine’s conviction that logic, natural science, and philosophy had important things to say to one another. The problem of interdisciplinary understanding<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

His landmark science fiction film does not attempt to free us somehow from our five senses, certainly. In fact, the film tends to enhance an appreciation of our perceptual faculties, particularly those of vision and hearing, as well as to encourage reflection on what we have experienced through our senses while watching the film. But Kubrick’s masterwork leads us beyond the borders of our conventional world<br>

  Abstract: A defining feature of science fiction is that such works of imaginative realism (a potent stylistic brew of perhaps irreconcilable elements) speculate about some future age or alternative, extraterrestrial world. That imagined place and time is characterized essentially by “advancements” in science that plausibly explore the consequences of what is now known and actively researched (in such areas as artificial intelligence, genetic manipulation, space travel, pharmacology, and so forth).

  Abstract: Jean-Luc Godard’s
                  Alphaville, une étrange aventure de Lemmy Caution(1965) appears on first viewing to be a typical variation of a classic science fiction film in which humanity has been invaded and is threatened with complete colonization by an alien force—in this case an alien computer, Alpha 60, which rules in the name of scientific logic. Indeed, Godard’s film even features a deranged scientist-villain, Leonard Von Braun (Howard Vernon), as the chief human agent of this alien colonization who has himself been converted into the apparently perfect scientific-technocratic man without a trace of human emotion. However, the deeper theme<br>

  Abstract: Hermeneutical theology is a distinct approach to theology. Hermeneutics itself is the science of interpretation.¹ Since Christianity is a textually based religion shaped by and oriented around a particular set of symbols, Christian theology needs to reinterpret its significant doctrines, texts,² and symbols for each new generation and within each new culture in which it emerges. Such interpretation is necessary for several reasons: on anthropological grounds, in light of the principle of analogy, because of the nature of foundational documents themselves, and, finally, in light of the hermeneutics of suspicion.³<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt43w">In Search of the Whole</a><br>
  Author(s) Byrne Patrick H.<br>
  Abstract: For as long as I can remember, I have loved science. Even before I knew that science was the category, I loved learning about the universe and just about everything within it. I think I was probably born with this love, but I was also fortunate to come of age in the late 1950s and 1960s, when science permeated the cultural atmosphere around me. The United States was then engaged in a great romance with science, and there was a rich and steady flow of scientific writing to stimulate my passion for learning about the natural world. Scientists were constantly<br>

  CHAPTER 8  Arriving at a Christocentric Universe from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt43w">In Search of the Whole</a><br>
  Author(s) Delio Ilia<br>
  Abstract: From where does a theological vision begin? What gives rise to theological insight and, in particular, to my insight? I ask these questions not only as a matter of self-reflection but out of wondrous surprise that I am a theologian because, truth be told, I never intended to be one. Unlike the typical theology student finely tuned in philosophy, theology, and classical languages, I was a hard-core student of science who took only the necessary courses in theology and philosophy to meet the requirements of my undergraduate institution. As a science major I believed that science held the key to<br>

  Abstract: In 1988 pope john paul ii put the following questions to the participants of a conference held in Rome to study the relationships between evolution and religion: “Does an evolutionary perspective bring any light to bear upon theological anthropology, the meaning of the human person as the 
                  imago Dei, the problem of Christology—and even upon the development of doctrine itself?” The pope was obviously aware that pursuing these and similar questions raised by the development of evolutionary science could stir the depths of Christian theology and required serious dialogue between theology and science.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I offered a response to a question that Pope John Paul II once addressed to evolutionary science, whether an evolutionary perspective would throw any light on Christian beliefs, specifically on the significance of the human person as created in the image of God. In answer, I proposed that human altruism, which puzzles many evolutionary scientists, can provide a theological link between God and his human creature in that altruism originates in the life of the divine Trinity of persons as they interact in self-donation to each other and are operative in the work of creation, and<br>

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Offering a critical view of all the texts in which Wittgenstein mentions Freud, Bouveresse immerses us in the intellectual climate of Vienna in the early part of the twentieth century. Although we come to see why Wittgenstein did not view psychoanalysis as a science proper, we are nonetheless made to feel the philosopher's sense of wonder and respect for the cultural task Freud took on as he found new ways meaningfully to discuss human concerns. Intertwined in this story of Wittgenstein's grappling with the theory of the unconscious is the story of how he came to question the authority of science and of philosophy itself. While aiming primarily at the clarification of Wittgenstein's opinion of Freud, Bouveresse's book can be read as a challenge to the French psychoanalytic school of Lacan and as a provocative commentary on cultural authority.<br>

  Foreword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt8cj">Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious</a><br>
  Author(s) DESCOMBES VINCENT<br>
  Abstract: In its original version, Jacques Bouveresse’s essay on Wittgenstein and psychoanalysis bears both a title and a subtitle, each of them unusually explicit:
                  Philosophy, Mythology, and Pseudo-Science: Wittgenstein Reads Freud. The subtitle,Wittgenstein Reads Freud, defines the book’s subject—namely, Wittgenstein’s judgments on Freud and, more generally, his attitude toward the man and his enterprise. The title,Philosophy, Mythology, and Pseudo-Science, announces the ultimate thrust of the entire discussion by introducing three intellectual categories: a new idea can come from eitherphilosophy,mythology, orscience. We can see that among these three registers, which share responsibility for intellectual invention, science<br>

  CHAPTER III  The “Generalizing Impulse,” or the Philosopher in Spite of Himself from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt8cj">Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious</a><br>
  Abstract: We have adopted the hypothesis of a psychical apparatus extended in space, appropriately constructed, developed by the exigencies of life, which gives rise to the phenomena of consciousness only at one particular point and under certain conditions. This hypothesis has put us in a position to establish psychology upon foundations similar to those of any other science, such as physics. In our science the problem is the<br>

  CHAPTER V  The Mechanics of the Mind from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt8cj">Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud’s colossal prejudices, in Wittgenstein’s view, all stem from three underlying assumptions of Freudian theory which he implicitly or explicitly contests. The first of these is psychic determinism, which Freud himself regularly presented as a constitutive preconception that could not be questioned. As Sulloway writes: “Freud’s entire life’s work in science was characterized by an abiding faith in the notion that all vital phenomena, including psychical ones, are rigidly and lawfully determined by the principle of cause and effect” (
                  Freud, Biologist of the Mind, p. 94). In thePsychopathology of Everyday Life, Freud explains what distinguishes his basic convictions from<br>

  8.  A Secular Age? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tv6pd">Being in the World</a><br>
  Abstract: At least in the Western context, our age is commonly referred to as that of “modernity”—a term sometimes qualified as “late modernity” or “post-modernity.” Taken by itself, the term is nondescript; in its literal sense, it simply means a time of novelty or innovation. Hence, something needs to be added to capture the kind of novelty involved. To pinpoint this innovation, modernity is also referred to as the “age of reason” or the age of enlightenment and science—in order to demarcate the period from a prior age presumably characterized by unreason, metaphysical speculation, and intellectual obscurantism or darkness.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b22q">Reading John with St. Thomas Aquinas</a><br>
  Author(s) Brown Stephen F.<br>
  Abstract: Many modern studies on the nature of theology according to St. Thomas Aquinas have been centered on his claim for a scientific study of divine revelation. This stress perhaps to a great extent is due to our modern concentration on the opening question of the 
                  Summa theologiae, where the second article asks: “Whether sacred doctrine is a science?” The immediate context is the preceding article: “ Whether besides the philosophical disciplines any further doctrine is required?” By placing sacred doctrine in contrast to the teachings of the philosophical disciplines, Aquinas invites us to compare the kind of science that each<br>

  Abstract: The utopian idea that progress in human affairs is automatic and unbroken was perhaps the biggest mistake made by early modern proponents of progress, according to Bernard Lonergan.¹ In his view these theorists failed to account for slowdowns and breakdowns, particularly those caused by sin and evil. Accompanying the many positive contributions of modernity to the natural and human sciences came an arrogance that believed that human intelligence at the service of personal egoism was the sufficient engine for progress, and human sin was what transforms an ordinary, unimportant person into a unique, free-thinking individual.² Modern liberals thus were aware<br>

  Abstract: This volume is a record of the proceedings of the ninth Building Bridges seminar for Christian and Muslim scholars, convened by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, and held at Georgetown University, Washington, DC, from May 25–27, 2010. The focus of this seminar on Christian and Muslim approaches to the relationship between tradition and modernity was a natural continuation of discussions at earlier Building Bridges seminars, notably on the interface between science and religion in 2009. Following an established pattern, after an opening day of public lectures, the second and third days were spent in private sessions discussing<br>

  Religious Authority and the Challenges of Modernity from:

  Author(s) JENKINS PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: Societies live by their myths. If asked about the modern history of religious authority, many Americans at least would turn to the legendary 1925 Scopes trial, the bitter confrontation between supporters and critics of Darwinian evolution, as mediated through the film 
                  Inherit the Wind (1960). Here, we think, reason and science ran rings around obscurantism and faith, and that victory marked the end of the Bible’s credibility as an infallible source of divine wisdom. While obviously this did not mark the end of religion, it set strict limits to the scope of religion’s claims, particularly in the public sphere. Religion,<br>

  Author(s) CORNELL VINCENT J.<br>
  Abstract: Chronologically the earliest of the Muslim reformers to be discussed in this volume, Muḥammad ʿAbduh is the most ambiguous in terms of understanding the full extent of his legacy in the century since his death. With the possible exception of his teacher and political mentor Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī (1838–97), he is arguably the most overinterpreted figure in modern Islamic thought. Indeed, it may be useful to think of ʿAbduh as the “Illustrated Man” of contemporary Sunnī Islam. Much as with the figure that is the frame device for Ray Bradbury’s classic work of science fiction,¹ the stories that are<br>

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

  Author(s) NGUYEN VINH-KIM<br>
  Abstract: I trained under Margaret Lock in the years after she published her seminal work
                  Encounters with Aging(1993). After three years of practising full-time as an emergency and HIV physician, the grind of medical practice had left me longing for an approach that went beyond the clinical or epidemiological sciences. Neither helped me make sense of what I saw in the clinic. As I began working in West Africa as a community organizer with HIV groups, most of the anthropological work I encountered viewed the epidemic through the lens of either culture or political economy.

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b8xg">Configuring Community</a><br>
  Abstract: No doubt it would be worthwhile to attempt a base definition of ‘community’ as currently in use, so as to establish a clear starting point for this research project. However, it is important to bear in mind that the term ‘community’ has long defied explicit definition in modern usage and a clear starting point thereby becomes problematic in itself. For this very reason, and because the commonly-shared premodern connotations of the term endow it with a solid sense of location whereby it has often provided a firm field of research in the social sciences, it has long been the focus<br>

For what distinguishes Jungius—and not just in the eyes of Leibniz, who entered into genuine partnership with this great pathbreaker of seventeenth-century science—is a decisive departure from dialectical and hermeneutic modes of proceeding and a turn toward empiricism and demonstrative logic (albeit purged of slavish devotion to Aristotle).

  Author(s) Sprinker Michael<br>
  Abstract: What is a consequent marxist view of the history and philosophy of science? Reference to Marx’s and Engels’s (or even Lenin’s) work will not yield a satisfactory answer, although certain signposts are evident. For example, there is the famous observation on method in the introduction to the
                  Grundrisse, which argues that, contrary to the procedures adopted in classical economy, where the starting point for investigation is apparently concrete phenomena from which abstract theoretical descriptions are then derived, “the method of rising from the abstract to the concrete is the only way in which thought appropriates the concrete, reproduces it as<br>

  Abstract: In 1982 Maxine Hairston wrote an essay that suggested the field of rhetoric and composition studies was undergoing a revolutionary change the likes of which Thomas Kuhn noticed occurring in the natural sciences (Hairston, “Winds of Change” 76–77). That essay is less notable for its assertion that composition studies was undergoing vast change than it is for its invocation of Kuhn. Three years earlier, Patricia Bizzell had written an article noting a similar shift in English studies, one closer to the spirit of Kuhnian paradigm shifts, suggesting that without foundations, students run the risk of thinking that all knowledge<br>

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: My purpose in this book is to inquire into the condition of the human sciences — accomplishments, weaknesses, and possibilities. I deal with the questions What sort of knowledge do the human sciences claim to be offering? To what extent can that knowledge be called scientific? and What do we mean by “scientific” in such a context? I also seek to contribute, however modestly, to changing the way we think about the subject.<br>

  1  The Problem of the Human Sciences from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bf4m">The Uncertain Sciences</a><br>
  Abstract: The natural sciences allow us to attain relatively certain understanding of, and predictive control and manipulative power over, natural processes — or so it is widely assumed. This view holds, assuredly among scientists, even in the face of postmodernism and the social constructionism of science. Many believe that the natural sciences may, and perhaps should, serve as a model for any attempt at comparable human sciences. Indeed, at the time of the Enlightenment it was widely held that nothing seriously stood in the way of the extension of scientific method to human matters, although there was disagreement over how to carry<br>

  Abstract: Culture is the key concept in much (though not all) of human science. Yet it is more useful to think of humans first as symbolic animals, rather than cultural animals, for symbolic abilities underlie the existence of both cultures and societies. The species, at the same time that its brain physically evolved, adding a cerebral cortex to its limbic core, increasingly replaced immediate, instinctual responses with delayed, thoughtful actions, mediated through symbols. We need not examine in detail the familiar findings of recent research that tell us of the development of symbolic language, with denotative and connotative characteristics, especially as<br>

  Abstract: Since its emergence in the seventeenth century, the word
                  hermeneuticshas referred to the science or art of interpretation. Until the end of the nineteenth century, it usually took the form of a theory that promised to lay out the rules governing the discipline of interpretation. Its purpose was predominantly normative, even technical. Hermeneutics limited itself to giving methodological directions to the specifically interpretive sciences, with the end of avoiding arbitrariness in interpretation as far as possible. Virtually unknown to outsiders, it long maintained the status of an “auxiliary discipline” within the established disciplines that concerned themselves with interpreting texts<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpmh">Interpreting Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: Like other disciplines in our universities, psychoanalysis has lately been reinterpreted as a hermeneutic discipline. Indeed, many traditional hermeneuts have singled out psychoanalysis, among the human sciences, as the exemplar of a hermeneutic discipline, and many psychoanalysts proclaim themselves converts to the hermeneutic reading of their discipline. An equally large number of psychoanalysts, however, repudiate that reading and reaffirm traditional understandings. The arguments for their repudiation are many, but in this book I am concerned with one in particular: the idea that, if patients were informed of the true nature of psychoanalysis on the hermeneutic reading, they would reject psychoanalysis<br>

  Abstract: The humanities may be defined as those disciplines primarily devoted to the study of texts. As the physical sciences concentrate on the study of natural phenomena, and the social sciences on the behavior of sentient creatures, the humanities are connected by their common interest in communicative objects, or texts. Human beings are text-producing animals, and those disciplines called “humanities” are primarily engaged in the analysis, interpretation, evaluation, and production of texts. Where there are texts, of course, there are rules governing text production and interpretation. These sets of rules or customs, with their physical or cultural constraints—variously described as<br>

  Abstract: If consciousness is always enacted behaviorally in a world and neuronal connectivity instantiates consciousness but does not necessarily explain it, there is every reason to hope that we might come to understand both self-referential consciousness and the primary sentience it reorganizes by studying their likely points of evolutionary emergence. Any attempt, however, to infer forms and levels of consciousness in the activities and sensitive attunements of organisms simpler than ourselves runs immediately into one of the most fundamental debates of modern science. The issue of animal consciousness clearly pits the basic criteria of theoretical parsimony and availability of methodological verification<br>

After all, it was the initial attempts at empirical laboratory research on visual imagery that were heralded as a “return of the ostracized” (Holt, 1962) — the beginning of modern psychology’s renewed interest in consciousness. Holt, among many others, hoped for a cognitive theory that would include the full range of phenomenological and clinical studies of imagistic states along with a laboratory science of imagery.

  12  Consciousness as Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: We have begun to consider consciousness in terms of its “with” — as the socially shared forms of awareness in self-referential symbolic beings. In addition, since symbolic cognition reuses the here-there, whence-whither dimensions of the array, this human “with” extends into the envelope of flow shared by all sentient motile beings. It remains to turn our attention back toward the “in” of consciousness. Human consciousness is inseparable from a being-in-the-world. The life worlds of sentient creatures are also “in” the physical universe as understood by modern physical science. Accordingly, we would expect the being of sentient creatures to be broadly<br>

  Abstract: Increasingly sophisticated research methods promise results from systematic investigations that are more psychoanalytically significant than those of past investigations. However, systematic investigation in psychoanalysis is unfortunately associated in many analysts’ minds, and also in the minds of many friends and foes of psychoanalysis, with a long history of fault finding. This attitude is epitomized in the criticisms of Eysenck (1952, 1966), Hook (1959), Grünbaum (1984, 1994), and Crews and colleagues (1995). Each of these authors asserts a rigidly positivistic view of science and shows that psychoanalysis<br>

  Book Title: The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Sneed Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: Scholars attempt to resolve the problem of the book of Ecclesiastes’ heterodox character in one of two ways, either explaining away the book’s disturbing qualities or radicalizing and championing it as a precursor of modern existentialism. This volume offers an interpretation of Ecclesiastes that both acknowledges the unorthodox nature of Qoheleth’s words and accounts for its acceptance among the canonical books of the Hebrew Bible. It argues that, instead of being the most secular and modern of biblical books, Ecclesiastes is perhaps one of the most religious and primitive. Bringing a Weberian approach to Ecclesiastes, it represents a paradigm of the application of a social-science methodology.<br>

  Author(s) Cohen Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century there was nearly universal consensus that Jews in the Islamic Middle Ages—taking al-Andalus, or Muslim Spain, as the model—lived in a “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim harmony,¹ an interfaith utopia of tolerance and
                  convivencia.² It was thought that Jews mingled freely and comfortably with Muslims, immersed in Arabic-Islamic culture, including the language, poetry, philosophy, science, medicine, and the study of Scripture—a society, furthermore, in which Jews could and many did ascend to the pinnacles of political power in Muslim government. This idealized picture went beyond Spain to encompass the entire Muslim world, from Baghdad<br>

  Jewish and Muslim Philosophy: from:

  Author(s) Harvey Steven<br>
  Abstract: Muslim and Jewish philosophers not only studied, interpreted, and commented upon the writings of Aristotle, but also played an important, indeed crucial, role in transferring his philosophy and science to the Christian West. Indeed, the emergence of Aristotle as the philosopher in thirteenth-century Scholastic philosophy is due in great measure to the Latin translations from Arabic of the writings of Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, and others. The Middle Ages was the golden age for both Muslim and Jewish philosophy. It was a period of significant contributions in science, as well as in the development of a rational explication of revealed religion.<br>

  1  Avicenna and Islamic Allegory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhz90">Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)</a><br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory represents a vast body of literature. It encompasses diverse genres—romance, “visionary recital,” exegesis, debate (
                  munâẓara), and fable. And its encoded “messages” stem from such varied disciplines as philosophy, mysticism, theology, political theory, and social and political satire. Despite this diversity in form and content, Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition. Writers of allegories belonged to a cosmopolitan class of Muslim elites who shared a common, often multilingual, educational background in the religious, intellectual, and literary sciences. One has only to note the frequency and ease with which individual scholars or writers moved throughout<br>

  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: The preference for an anthropological reflection upon identity processes as a means to overcome the micro-macro dichotomy that has hampered the development of the social sciences (Calhoun 1996) immediately faces a number of obstacles. A strategy of total subjective and relative social research, reduced to micro-dimensions (limited to the construction of the self and interaction), may impede an analysis of the relationships between socio-historical groups. Similarly, a strategy of conceptual and theoretical babelisation of the concept of identity (and its derivatives) may lead to the loss of its analytical function in understanding historical dynamics.<br>

  Abstract: At the turn of the 20th century, cinema emerged in a context marked by the vast expansion of interest in bodily movement, at the crossroads of aesthetic and scientific preoccupations. Already developed by Enlightenment philosophers and Romantic poets, the quest for the origins of nonverbal language and mime permeated the discussion of disciplines such as psychology or anthropology,¹ which were in the process of being institutionalized. Furthermore, new images of the body were created and distributed via experimental sciences, which considered the mechanism of physical movement as stemming from circulation and energy consumption.

  Book Title: The Making of the Humanities-Volume 1- Early Modern Europe<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weststeijn Thijs<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first step towards the development of a comparative history of the humanities. Specialists in philology, musicology, art history, linguistics, literary theory, and other disciplines highlight the intertwining of the various fields and their impact on the sciences. This first volume in the series The Making of the Humanities focuses on the early modern period. Different perspectives reveal how the humanities developed from the 'liberal arts', via the curriculum of humanistic schools, to modern disciplines. The authors show in particular how discoveries in the humanities contributed to a secular world view, pointing up connections with the scientific revolution. The main themes are: the humanities versus the sciences; the visual arts as liberal arts; humanism and heresy; language and poetics; linguists and logicians; philology and philosophy; the history of history. Contributions come from a selection of internationally renowned European and American scholars, including Floris Cohen, David Cram, and Ingrid Rowland. The book offers a wealth of insights for specialists, students, and those interested in the humanities in a broad sense. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  Author(s) Leezenberg Michiel<br>
  Abstract: The history of the humanities, or
                  Geisteswissenschaften, lags far behind the historiography of the exact or natural sciences. Therefore, one may fruitfully look for models or examples in the history of the natural sciences in order to avoid reinventing the wheel, or running into difficulties that have already been encountered elsewhere, and perhaps even solved. There are also more principled reasons, however, for thematizing the rise of a strict disciplinary opposition between the humanities and the natural sciences, an opposition which is more recent and less stable than one might think. A strict distinction between them (e.g. as concerned with<br>

  Abstract: The topic and goals of this conference are admirable ones: to initiate an ongoing investigation of the history of the humane sciences not unlike that of the history of the physical and natural sciences conceived of and promoted by George Sarton at Harvard in the first half of the twentieth century. Of course there has long been a field of the history of scholarship,² but this promises to be more accessible than that, in its implicit nod in the direction of pedagogy through the humanities curriculum, already studied for the Renaissance by such eminent scholars as Eugenio Garin, Paul Oskar<br>

  Author(s) Bos Jacques<br>
  Abstract: Most disciplines in the humanities are not very concerned with their own history. Although the dialogue between contemporary scholars and their predecessors might extend into a somewhat further past than in the natural and social sciences, the various fields of the humanities tend to reflect just as little on their own history as, for instance, chemistry or psychology. Historians seem to be the main exception to this tendency: unlike most other disciplines, history has a long tradition of examining its own past. In many university programmes the history of historical writing is a compulsory course, and there is a wide<br>

  Abstract: Childhood studies, a field designed to dismantle inaccurate and often destructive definitions of childhood, has yet to come up with a consensus on what we mean when we say “child” in the first place. If the child is socially constructed, as Philippe Ariès has argued, and as many of our contributors take as a given, how can we possibly hope to work through those constructions to extract an authentic person? As the conversation moves between the humanities and the social sciences, between archivists and activists, childhood studies struggles with the question of how to bridge the relationship between the rhetorical<br>

Our first two contributions by Sarah Chinn and Susan Honeyman pick up the theme of educational control ably introduced in section 2 and explore the work of disciplining children’s habits of love and attachment. They do so by focusing on heteronormative control over children’s gender and sexuality or, to be more precise, the social insistence that children cannot<br>

  Abstract: There is a significant difference between a person being considered to be ʹprofessionalʹ in their approach to conducting business, whatever that business may be, and a person being part of a profession and therefore considered to be a professional. This difference has created enormous misunderstanding and confusion within the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, and hampered its progress towards being recognised as a profession. Being part of a profession is a vocation requiring knowledge of some department of learning or science, for example, medicine, law, engineering, architecture, accountancy and, more recently, ICT.<br>

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

                  2001: A Space Odyssey(1968). HAL, arguably the film’s principal antagonist, is an advanced AI that oversees and manages every operational aspect of theDiscoveryspacecraft. AsDiscoverymakes its way to Jupiter, HAL begins to manifest what appears to be mistakes or errors, despite that fact that, as HAL is quick to point out, no 9000 computer has ever made a mistake.

  Abstract: How might we reconsider the topic of “scriptures” in the midst of what the African historian Steven Feierman has called the “general epistemological crisis affecting all the social sciences and humanities”?¹ We find ourselves at sea in this crisis every time we write, not just when explicitly describing the other, and can only navigate its politics successfully if we recognize the dangers of what Emmanuel Levinas termed an ontological imperialism where otherness vanishes as part of the same of modernity.²<br>

Or in the lived experiences of a still-active mind trying to express a voice, to perform an action, but unable to find the means to do so? How do seemingly disparate bits and pieces of pathology, clinical history, social relationships, and specialist training come together? How do these fractured components form interpretable constellations that help us better understand the science; the sufferers; the relationships between dementia, data, and the diagnostic process?<br>

  Abstract: In the human and social sciences, the modern academic study of memory is generally acknowledged to have been initiated by the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs (1925; 1992). Virtually effaced from scholarly consciousness, he received academic acceptance only decades following his death in Buchenwald. His omnipresence in current memory studies owes much to the work of Jan Assmann, himself the author of a classic work on memory theory. In part dependent on Halbwachs and in part quite separately, memory has recently emerged as a pivotal concept in cultural studies and as a principal topic of research in the humanities and social sciences.<br>

Negatively speaking what is at stake is a challenge to what Foley has called “the textualist bias of our scholarship, with its easy assimilation of all forms of verbal art to the literary-textual model” (1995, 87). This text-centered perspective has involved a sense of textual autonomy, textualization as an end in itself, texts’ localization in intertextual networks, and a dominantly textual hermeneutics—all notions closely allied with the historical and literary paradigm.<br>

In part dependent on Halbwachs and in part quite separately, memory has recently emerged as a pivotal concept in cultural studies and as a principal topic of research in the humanities and social sciences.<br>

  12  Orality and Biblical Scholarship: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjh34">Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: In keeping with developments in the human and social sciences, we have for some time now experienced a recovery and reconsideration of the oral factor in biblical studies. Negatively speaking what is at stake is a challenge to what Foley has called “the textualist bias of our scholarship, with its easy assimilation of all forms of verbal art to the literary-textual model” (1995, 87). This text-centered perspective has involved a sense of textual autonomy, textualization as an end in itself, texts’ localization in intertextual networks, and a dominantly textual hermeneutics—all notions closely allied with the historical and literary paradigm.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjh34">Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: Three interrelated features may be said to characterize the work of Edith Wyschogrod. There is first an interdisciplinary drive to rise above institutionally sanctioned boundaries and to retrieve intellectual categories from their disciplinary captivity so as to reconfigure them in novel contexts. It is this desire and the ability to bring widely differing genres, discourses, and traditionally separate intellectual orbits into productive coalitions that has increasingly distinguished her writings. This interfacing of philosophy and theology, psychoanalysis and science, literary criticism and linguistics, architecture and the arts, media studies and above all ethics is carried off with a high degree of<br>

  Book Title: Political Creativity-Reconfiguring Institutional Order and Change<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Hattam Victoria<br>
  Abstract: Political Creativityintervenes in the lively debate currently underway in the social sciences on institutional change. Editors Gerald Berk, Dennis C. Galvan, and Victoria Hattam, along with the contributors to the volume, show how institutions inevitably combine order and change, because formal rules and roles are always available for reconfiguration. Creative action is not the exception but the very process through which all political formations are built, promulgated and changed.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Abstract: The game’s afoot in institutionalist research. As institutionalists grapple with change, diversity, innovation, indeterminacy, creativity, and surprising assemblages of institutional artifacts, some have come to question the implicit structuralist foundations of their research and turned elsewhere for help. The catalog is big and growing. Among other traditions, institutionalists have turned to social studies of science, action theory, ecology, narrative knowing, poststructuralism, constructivism, postcolonialism, pragmatism, theories of entrepreneurship, religious studies, and economic anthropology. This volume assembles a group of political scientists, whose only obvious commonality is their restlessness with structuralism and their commitment to alternative intellectual traditions to animate their research.<br>

  Abstract: The federal government’s rescue of General Motors and Chrysler in 2008–2009 was a dramatic reminder that a liberal state can exert plenary powers to stem a public crisis by controlling the primary agents. Yet federal action came at a moment when social science debates about how institutions shape change had reached a point where government intervention is less significant than the ways that agents are able to innovate from institutional routines.¹ The successful auto bailout raised questions about the evolution of government-market relationships and the capacity of government to improve on market outcomes.

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: THIS BOOK is intended for the practicing social scientist or social science student. It is concerned with actual research, and focuses on three main questions: (1) What are the actual goals of the various current research methods? Call the goals “truth” or “knowledge”; then what characteristics does achieved truth have in the various methods? (2) What social, cognitive, and personality processes occur or should occur during research, and how do they contribute to the outcome? (3) What persistent weaknesses and dangers appear in research, and what can we do about them?<br>

  1  Logical Empiricism, 1922–1970 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: LOGICAL EMPIRICISM was the dominant movement in twentieth-century philosophy of science until about 1965. During its prime in the 1950s it dominated the field so totally that philosophers regarded it as identical with philosophy of science itself. Its basic definitions and distinctions were regarded as self-evident, and anyone who questioned them was contemptuously ignored as simply not a philosopher of science. After about 1958, it was increasingly on the defensive against newer movements, and by 1970 all the innovation was occurring in the newer movements. By 1980 it had almost completely disappeared from philosophy of science convention programs in the<br>

  2  Popper and His Followers from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: FOR THE LOGICAL empiricists, Popper was simply one of the Vienna Circle, a member who made valuable contributions to analytic philosophy of science. He was a dissenting member who had pointed out some of the difficulties that led to early revisions of doctrine. His most valuable contribution was to emphasize that testing could involve falsification as well as verification. The two kinds of testing are symmetrical (Hempel, 1965, pp. 39–40). An existential statement like “Some ravens in western Manitoba have green heads” could be conclusively verified by going there and finding two or three of them, but could never<br>

  3  Kuhn and Stegmüller from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: KUHN’S THEORY of scientific revolutions swept through the social sciences in the early 1970s with enormous effect. One theorist after another announced that the social sciences were in crisis, that the old paradigm was collapsing under the weight of its anomalies, and that the new paradigm had just appeared. If we are to believe all these announcements, the social sciences experienced a revolution every six months, on the average, in those years. In each case, all the social sciences were included in the old paradigm except for a few anticipations and predecessors of the theorist making the announcement. His work,<br>

  6  Macrosociology of Social Science from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: THE MODERN macrosociology of science begins with the work of Robert Merton in the 1930s. The evidence for the above statement consists of citation counts of journal articles (Cole and Zuckerman, 1975), reports of informants (Storer, 1973, esp. p. xi), and acknowledgments and tracing of ideas in leading works such as Hagstrom (1965). Many sociologists of science since 1960 were Merton’s students or students of students (Cole and Zuckerman, 1975, p. 155), and others took up and developed some of his ideas, for instance, Blissett (1972) and Mitroff (1974a).

  8  Science Politics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjpmm">How Does Social Science Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: FOR THE MERTONIANS, social science is an autonomous subsystem of society unified by its own institutionalized values. The values have to be maintained by socialization and by rewards handed out by elite scientists for conformity. However, Mertonian empirical investigations have complicated this scheme by suggesting that all or nearly all norms are accompanied by equally valid counternorms. The resulting normative ambivalence produces conflict as well as unity, since scientists can urge norms on others while they themselves follow counternorms. Shared values thus can serve as rhetorical devices in disputes, rather than as unifying forces. Consequently, the unity-disunity balance must be<br>

  3  Thickening Ambiguity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjq68">Dancing Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: If existence is indeterminate, open-ended and not predictable, then we dance as unfinished metaphysical artifacts in much the same way as phenomenology and evolutionary science explain how life is ongoing.
                     We are works in progress, in other words, and like works of art we live between content and process. Our living metaphysical reality does not mount to heaven, but spreads into our everyday dances—of auspicious being and indeterminate becoming.<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen, there are many explanations for why and how illness memoirs evolved into a thriving genre in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. When science developed better explanations for disease and more effective treatments, personal stories of illness were displaced from clinical settings in the United States and surfaced elsewhere. With the growth of the publishing industry, changed attitudes toward personal disclosure, patient activism about women’s health and AIDS, and the rise of the Internet, more people turned to the

  CHAPTER 13  Postcolonial Anthropology in the French-speaking World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjgn6">Postcolonial Thought in the French Speaking World</a><br>
  Author(s) Richards David<br>
  Abstract: It is a foolish commentator indeed who would attempt to claim a precise moment in history when anthropology in the French-speaking world
                  becamepostcolonial – that point in time when predominantly French anthropological thought turned on its own history of involvement in the imperial enterprise and began to challenge anthropological theories and practices grounded in the discourses and assumptions of colonialism. That anthropology was one of the handmaidens of colonialism, a science of empire, is indisputable and well documented. For many, the postcolonial turn has yet to occur and anthropology is still irredeemably and fatally tainted by its colonial origins.<br>

  CHAPTER 24  From Colonial to Postcolonial: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjgn6">Postcolonial Thought in the French Speaking World</a><br>
  Author(s) Blanchard Pascal<br>
  Abstract: Over the past two decades, postcolonial studies – or postcolonial theory – has firmly established itself within the Anglophone academy. In France, however, the perception of this critical body of thought labours under a certain number of misconceptions that have rendered the development of an equivalent ‘hexagonal’ movement deeply problematic, and have given rise instead to a determined opposition in the general ‘intellectual field’. By ‘intellectual field’ we mean the broad domain constituted by publications and debates in the social sciences, particularly sociology, history, political sciences and, more marginally, anthropology. This ‘intellectual field’ includes academic publications, but also essays by<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Latin American Varieties of Modernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjmbn">Varieties of World Making</a><br>
  Author(s) Larrain Jorge<br>
  Abstract: Following Castoriadis, I shall understand by ‘modernity’ the conjunction of two key significations: autonomy and control. Autonomy refers to the freedom of a society to make its own laws; control has to do with the expansion of rational mastery over the world of things, including the development of science and technology and their application to production and the control of nature (Castoriadis 1990: 15–17). Peter Wagner has developed this idea more precisely into an ‘interpretative approach’, which focuses on the responses that human beings give to certain basic

  CHAPTER 5  Islam Online: from:

  Author(s) Siapera Eugenia<br>
  Abstract: The historico-political developments following September 11 2001 have raised the profile of Islam and its political relevance. From a secular and liberal perspective, religious/transcendental struggles should be confined to the private domain and should concern individual consciences. However, the forceful entry of Islam as a topic into the public domain post-9/11 represents a questioning of the secular/liberal world. This raises broader questions about the links between religion and politics and the relevance of religious interpretations for our life in common and in the commons, that is, in the public domain. At stake here are the common elements and bonds necessary<br>

  Book Title: Artists, Intellectuals, and World War II-The Pontigny Encounters at Mount Holyoke College, 19421944<br>
  Publisher: University of Massachusetts Press<br>
  Author(s): Remmler Karen<br>
  Abstract: Sixty years ago, at the height of World War II, an extraordinary series of gatherings took place at Mount Holyoke College in western Massachusetts. During the summers of 1942–1944, leading Europeanﬁgures in the arts and sciences met at the college with their American counterparts for urgent conversations about the future of human civilization in a precarious world. Two Sorbonne professors, the distinguished medievalist Gustave Cohen and the existentialist philosopher Jean Wahl, organized these “Pontigny” sessions, named after an abbey in Burgundy where similar symposia had been held in the decades before the war. Among the participants—many of whom were Jewish or had Jewish backgrounds—were the philosophers Hannah Arendt and Rachel Bespaloff, the poets Marianne Moore and Wallace Stevens, the anthropologist Claude LéviStrauss and the linguist Roman Jakobson, and the painters Marc Chagall and Robert Motherwell. In this collection of original essays, Stanley Cavell and Jacques Derrida lead an international group of scholars—including Jed Perl, Mary Ann Caws, Jeffrey Mehlman, and Elisabeth YoungBruehl—in assessing the lasting impact and contemporary signiﬁcance of Pontignyen Amérique. Rachel Bespaloff, a tragicﬁgure who wrote a major work on the Iliad, is restored to her rightful place beside Arendt and Simone Weil. Anyone interested in the “intellectual resistance” of Francophone intellectuals and artists, and the inspiring support from such Americanﬁgures as Stevens and Moore, will want to read this pioneering work of scholarship and historical recreation.<br>

  Author(s) Leighton Denys P.<br>
  Abstract: Many humanities and social science scholars today are committed to, or at any rate, pay lip service to ideals of interdisciplinarity and methodological cross-fertilization. In light of this fact, it is remarkable that there should be so little dialogue between historians of philosophy (including those who study political and religious philosophy) and intellectual historians, particularly with respect to study of ‘non-Western’ thought systems or world views. A common tendency among intellectual historians today is to reduce history of philosophy to a minor province of philosophical hermeneutics. The increasingly ahistorical philosophical hermeneuticists, in turn, usually prioritize exposition and internal analysis of<br>

  Abstract: Often, when people think of research, they think of the tradition of the natural sciences that began during the Enlightenment: an attempt to go beyond the word of God, tradition, folklore, and other nonempirical sources of knowledge. Scientific research is based on an assumption that the world is a predictable place, if only we can determine the laws by which it operates.

  Book Title: Mindscapes-Philosophy, Science, and the Mind<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Machamer Peter K.<br>
  Abstract: Leading scholars in the fields of philosophy and the sciences of the mind have contributed to this newest volume in the prestigious Pittsburgh-Konstanz series. Among the problem areas discussed are folk psychology, meanings as conceptual structures, functional and qualitative properties of colors, the role of conscious mental states, representation and mental content, the impact of connectionism on the philosophy of the mind, and supervenience, emergence, and realization. Most of the essays are followed by commentaries that reflect ongoing debates in the philosophy of the mind and often develop a counterpoint to the claims of the essayists.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkgzz">Mindscapes</a><br>
  Author(s) Machamer Peter<br>
  Abstract: One of the chief characteristics of contemporary philosophy of mind consists in the orientation toward the sciences of the mind. This feature stands in marked contrast to traditional philosophy of mind whose primary allegiance was to philosophy of language. Linguistic analysis was supposed to clarify what could sensibly be meant by the ascription of mental states. The issue was what sort of talk about the mental has a clear meaning and what, by contrast, is to be considered meaningless. This type of philosophical approach to the mind has now gone out of fashion. It was replaced by a science-based approach<br>

  Abstract: Philosophical debate has focused on two sets of issues, both of which were raised by Churchland’s article. The first, which has received the most attention, concerns the status of folk psychology. Is folk psychology false? Could it ever be replaced by scientific psychology or by neuroscience? The second, which has recently gained considerable momentum, concerns what I shall call the “form” of folk psychology: Is folk psychology really a<br>

  Abstract: In the following comment, I intend to discuss critically one central claim, perhaps the central thesis, of Martine Nida-Rümelin’s paper.

  Author(s) Lahav Ran<br>
  Abstract: Until recently, the issue of the nature of consciousness was almost exclusively in the hands of philosophers. As the various sciences of the mind progress and accumulate new data, more empirical light is being shed on the phenomenon of consciousness (see, for example, Velmans 1991; Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992; Lahav 1993; Marcel and Bisiach 1988). Although we are still at a very early stage of the scientific understanding of the human mind, I think that the attempt to examine what current scientific knowledge can tell us about that phenomenon is worthwhile.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkgzz">Mindscapes</a><br>
  Author(s) Allen Colin<br>
  Abstract: Psychology, according to a standard dictionary definition, is the science of mind and behavior. For a major part of the twentieth century, (nonhuman) animal psychology was on a behavioristic track that explicitly denied the possibility of a science of animal mind. While many comparative psychologists remain wedded to behavioristic methods, they have more recently adopted a cognitive, information-processing approach that does not adhere to the strictures of stimulus-response explanations of animal behavior. Cognitive ethologists are typically willing to go much further than comparative psychologists by adopting folk-psychological terms to explain the behavior of nonhuman animals.<br>

  Author(s) van Gelder Tim<br>
  Abstract: After connectionism burst into prominence in cognitive science in mid-1980s, one of the most popular questions among philosophers of cognitive science was: what implications does it have for the philosophy of mind? (See, e.g., Horgan and Tienson 1991; Ramsey, Stich, and Rumelhart, 1991). Ten years later, it seems that the verdict is in. If we suppose that the term
                  connectionismrefers to some reasonably coherent research program standing as an alternative to mainstream computational cognitive science, then connectionism hasnointeresting implications for cognitive science. This is because there is, in fact,no suchthing. There are lots of connectionist<br>

  Author(s) Grünbaum Adolf<br>
  Abstract: In 1975, I was engaged in a systematic scrutiny of Karl Popper’s falsificationist conception of scientific rationality. The purported unfalsifiability of psychoanalytic theory by any potential empirical evidence was the avowed centerpiece of his case against the ‘inductivist’ tradition in the philosophy of science. Prompted by my strong hunch that Popper’s appraisal of psychoanalysis was simplistic, I began to study the very large Freudian corpus systematically from scratch in 1975.<br>

  Book Title: The Religion and Science Debate-Why Does It Continue?<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wuthnow Robert<br>
  Abstract: Why does the tension between science and religion continue? How have those tensions changed during the past one hundred years? How have those tensions impacted the public debate about so-called "intelligent design" as a scientific alternative to evolution? With wit and wisdom the authors address the conflict from its philosophical roots to its manifestations within American culture. In doing so, they take an important step toward creating a society that reconciles scientific inquiry with the human spirit. This book, which marks the one hundredth anniversary of The Terry Lecture Series, offers a unique perspective for anyone interested in the debate between science and religion in America.<br>

  Author(s) THOMSON KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Science and religion, science versus religion: the subject was argued by the ancient Greeks and scholars of the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment. In choosing this subject for its centennial occasion, the Committee for the Terry Lectures has highlighted an issue that is both ancient and modern, exquisitely complex and painfully simple. The one certainty that we share with our intellectual forebears in this matter is the need for well-considered dialogue. For both Cicero and David Hume (

  Author(s) NUMBERS RONALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Talk of the relations between “science” and “religion” first became audible in the early 1800s, about the time that students of nature began referring to their work as science rather than natural philosophy (or natural history). Because natural philosophy allowed its practitioners, in the words of Isaac Newton, to discourse about God “from the appearances of things,” one searches almost in vain for references to “natural philosophy and religion.” Some writers expressed concern about tension between faith and reason, but they never pitted religion against science.¹<br>

  Author(s) MILLER KENNETH R.<br>
  Abstract: To many within academia, the notion of a “religion and science debate” seems to be the stuff of history.¹ It conjures up visions of papal courts and forbidden books, of nineteenth-century confrontations between reason and superstition in the halls of royal societies, of a world in which the value of science had yet to prove itself, even in the minds of the most learned members of society. It comes as somewhat of a shock, therefore, to realize that this debate is as contemporary as the last election, as far-reaching as the global village itself, and as important to the future<br>

Many Christians have the vague impression that science is somehow unfriendly to religious belief; for other Christians it is less a vague impression than a settled conviction. Similarly, many scientists and science enthusiasts argue that there is opposition between serious religious belief and science; indeed, some claim that religious belief constitutes a clear and present danger to science.¹ Still others see religious belief as steadily dwindling in the face of scientific advance. Our question is: Why does this debate continue?<br>

  Abstract: Signs of Science: Literature, Science, and spa Modernity since 1868 traces how spa culture represented scientific activity from the mid-nineteenth century onward. The book combines the global perspective afforded by historical narrative with detailed rhetorical analyses of images of science in specific literary and scientific texts. As literary criticism it seeks to illuminate similarities and differences in how science and scientists are pictured; as cultural history it follows the course of a centuries-long dialogue about Spain and science.<br>

  Abstract: In the literary mind, science can either work alongside the Muses or attempt to replace them. As the previous chapter shows, the realists relegated discussions of the most radical scientific theory of the nineteenth century—organic evolution—to the periphery of their texts. Despite their hesitancy on that particular subject, they nevertheless grappled with many questions about the place of modem science in society. The realists’ most important discoveries—as evidenced by their increased skepticism toward positivism—incorporate two different perspectives on scientific discourse. Friedrich Nietzsche argued that the “real world” studied by scientists was pitifully bleak and bereft of<br>

The “tragic feeling of life” results from the most difficult question ever to face philosophy: how to justify its pursuit of reason as a worthy facet of a life well lived. For Unamuno, reason alone can provide only intellectual, not emotive or spiritual, fulfillment: “el más trágico problema de la filosofía es el de conciliar las necesidades intelectuales con las necesidades afectivas y con las volitivas”

This historical narrative arises from detailed rhetorical analysis of the themes and poetics that make up literary images of science. It finds its inspiration in the intellectual preoccupations of the period it encompasses. The irony implicit in a study of multifarious images is that its own imaging of real processes in nineteenth-and twentieth-century Spanish culture remains unavoidably incomplete.

  Author(s) Vasvári Louise O.<br>
  Abstract: The editors of
                  Comparative Central European Holocaust Studiesand the authors of the volume's articles subscribe to the proposition that the study of the Holocaust is of immanent social relevance and responsibility in scholarship and public discourse. In turn, the notion of the social relevance of humanities and social sciences scholarship is a tenet of the theoretical and methodological framework of comparative cultural studies (McClennen and Morello, McClennen and Fitz; Tötösy de Zepetnek,Comparative Literature, "From Comparative Literature," "Comparative Cultural," "The New Humanities").

  Author(s) Kōshirō Tamaki<br>
  Abstract: Tamaki Kōshirō graduated in 1940 from what was then the Tokyo Imperial University and taught there from 1959 until his retirement in 1976, after which he taught at Tōhoku University and Nihon University. Along with Hisamatsu Shin’ichi* and Nishitani Keiji*, Tamaki is one of the finest representatives of Japanese Buddhist philosophy. A specialist in early Buddhism, he also lectured in subjects as varied as modern Indian thought, German idealism, Jungian psychology, and contemporary philosophy of science. Not only did he have detailed knowledge of modern Buddhist scholarship, he pressed for greater attention to religious experience and philosophical thought. Already as<br>

  Author(s) Sōhō Takuan<br>
  Abstract: Beginning as a nine-year-old novice monk of poor farmer-warrior origins, by the age of thirty-six Takuan Sōhō had risen to become abbot of Daitoku-ji, the imperial Rinzai Zen monastic complex in Kyoto. Takuan’s Zen was extraordinarily wide-reaching. It covered monastic theory and practice (extensive literary ⌜kōan⌝ practice, dharma talks, popular sermons, temple regulations), literature (poetry, literary criticism, travel diaries, essays, extensive correspondence), martial and cultural arts (swordsmanship, tea ceremony, calligraphy, ink-wash painting, Nō drama criticism), ethics (Daoist and Confucian), Chinese science (metaphysical reflections on the

  Author(s) Hajime Tanabe<br>
  Abstract: Tanabe Hajime was first drawn to philosophy through his study of mathematics and the natural sciences. His early work on the philosophy of science brought him into contact with the neo-Kantians, which inspired him to rethink Kant’s transcendental logic in the light of Husserl’s phenomenology, Bergson’s vitalism, and the original philosophy of Nishida Kitaro*. After Nishida invited him to join the faculty at Kyoto University, he was able to fulfill his dream of studying in Europe. Although quickly disillusioned with Husserl, he was befriended by the young Heidegger.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqg76">Japanese Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Ever since Socrates accepted the Delphic oracle’s challenge to “know thyself,” the issue of personal identity has been part of the western philosophical repertoire. That issue typically broke down into two fundamental questions. The first was one of individual identity: who am I? The second was one of universal identity: what characterizes our humanity? Only in recent history has the West added questions of cultural, linguistic, and ethnic identity: for example, what does it mean to be French Canadian? Three circumstances have supported this rather new enterprise. The first is the rise of the social sciences, especially cultural anthropology, sociology,<br>

  Abstract: As Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762) indicates at the beginning of his treatise
                  Aesthetica, “Aesthetics (theory of the liberal arts, doctrine of inferior knowledge, art of beautiful thinking, art of analogous reasoning) is the science of sensible knowledge” (1750, 17). This is the opening statement of a work that is considered to be the genealogical moment in the creation of aesthetics as an autonomous philosophical field—a creation prompted by the need to rescue the senses from the primacy of reason. The association of feelings (aisthesis) with the fallacious world of experience has a long history that goes back to<br>

  Author(s) ABÉ RYŪICHI<br>
  Abstract: There was an epistemic shift in the production of Japanese Buddhist texts in the early Heian period, a shift that enabled Buddhists to incorporate the elements of meditation, ritual, and religious practice in general within the science of scriptural exegesis. Until the early ninth century, the exegetic texts written by Japanese Buddhist scholars were concerned entirely with doctrinal issues. By contrast, by the mid-tenth century, the great majority of Buddhist commentarial texts had their focus on ritual practices, especially on the rituals of esoteric Buddhism, the ritual practices that became integral within the management of the Heian court and the<br>

  Book Title: Interpretation-Ways of Thinking about the Sciences and the Arts<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolters Gereon<br>
  Abstract: The act of interpretation occurs in nearly every area of the arts and sciences. That ubiquity serves as the inspiration for the fourteen essays of this volume, covering many of the domains in which interpretive practices are found. Individual topics include: the general nature of interpretation and its forms; comparing and contrasting interpretation and hermeneutics; culture as interpretation seen through Hegel's aesthetics; interpreting philosophical texts; methodologies for interpreting human action; interpretation in medical practice focusing on manifestations as indicators of disease; the brain and its interpretative, structured, learning and storage processes; interpreting hybrid wines and cognitive preconceptions of novel objects; and the importance of sensory perception as means of interpreting in the case of dry German Rieslings.In an interesting turn, Nicholas Rescher writes on the interpretation of philosophical texts. Then Catherine Wilson and Andreas Blank explicate and critique Rescher's theories through analysis of the mill passage from Leibniz's
      Monadology.<br>

  2  The Logic of Interpretation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrd67">Interpretation</a><br>
  Author(s) Lorand Ruth<br>
  Abstract: It is traditionally held that interpretation is the method of the humanities, while explanation is the method of the sciences. At the same time, it is widely accepted that interpretation is an all-embracing activity and thus all cognitions are modes of interpretation, and moreover, as Gadamer declared, “Alles Verstehen ist Auslegen” [All understanding is interpretation] (Gadamer 1965, 366). It is clear that both views cannot coexist. If explanation is distinct from interpretation, and thereby distinguishes the sciences from the humanities, interpretation cannot be the umbrella concept that covers all understanding.<br>

  Abstract: Generally, we use the term

In this second meaning, hermeneutics embraces various epistemological, ontological, and, broadly speaking, philosophical problems that stretch well beyond questions of the unity of the scientific method, the contrast betweenunderstandingandexplanation,and the distinction betweenGeistenwissenschaften… andNaturwissenschaften. In Heidegger’s hands, hermeneutics became a general philosophical theory of Being, truth, and objectivity and Hans-Georg Gadamer states that the ontological-hermeneutical approach gives an answer to the question of foundation not only in human sciences but also in<br>

  Abstract: So long as ecocritics are trapped in the “two cultures” ideology that polarizes literature from science and human society from nonhuman nature, we will find it difficult to define a middle ground from which literature and science can be seen as partners, and humans and nonhumans as agents, all cooperating to form the world we share. To locate this middle ground we need to think not of a monolithic “Science” but of the various practices and disciplines of the sciences, and in this quest our natural allies will be our colleagues in science studies.

His thinking manifests a lifelong engagement with modern science, which he saw in a necessary complementarity with philosophy.

  Abstract: In this essay I explore an ecocritical theory of cultural, and thus also literary, creativity from a biosemiotic point of view. While what follows might be thought broadly to fall within what is sometimes called the “post” humanities, in fact biosemiotics is a thoroughly interdisciplinary proto-discipline; it seeks not only to change how humanists think about culture, the arts, and the biological sciences but also to change how scientists and social scientists think about biological science and the arts and humanities.<br>

  Book Title: Essays from the Edge-Parerga and Paralipomena<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): JAY MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Over his distinguished career as a European intellectual historian and cultural critic, Martin Jay has explored a variety of major themes: the Frankfurt School, the exile of German intellectuals in America during the Nazi era, Western Marxism, the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought, the discourse of experience in modern Europe and America, and lying in politics.
         Essays from the Edgeassembles Jay's writings from the intersections of this intellectual journey. Several essays focus on methodological debates in the humanities and social sciences: the limits of interdisciplinarity, the issue of national or universal philosophy, cultural relativism and visuality, and the implications of periodization in historical narrative. Others examine the concept of "scopic regime" and the metaphors of revolution and the gardening impulse. Among the theorists treated at length are Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The essays also include several of Jay'sSalmagundicolumns, dealing with subjects as varied as the new Museum of Modern Art in New York, the impact of Colin Wilson's The Outsider, and the demise of thePartisan Review.<br>

  Abstract: One must study the totality of Corbin’s published work to understand that this great Islamicist was something other than an Islamicist.¹ He wrote what he came to call “prophetic philosophy,” a kind of esoteric science complemented by the acceptable apparatus of footnotes.² Influences on this elaborate conception, however, have not yet been traced in full, though many of them are by now well known. Corbin’s esoterism blended medieval philosophy, occultism, History of Religions, Lutheran theology, Shi‘ite ideology, into a brilliantly polished, absolutely authentic, and utterly irreproducible mixture.

But his relative obscurity today should not lead us to gloss over the importance he has had for pivotal thinkers in a number of periods.

The invasion of those sciences by alien and inappropriate modes of thought has conduced toward the destruction of their distinctiveness, their autonomy, their effectiveness, and their relevance.<br>

Since it got truly launched as a discipline and a profession in the last half of the nineteenth century, mainly by Germans, the self-proclaimed “science of the mind” has not just been troubled with a proliferation of theories, methods, arguments, and techniques.

  Book Title: Essays on Giordano Bruno-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): GATTI HILARY<br>
  Abstract: The book is divided into sections that address three broad subjects: the relationship between Bruno and the new science, the history of his reception in English culture, and the principal characteristics of his natural philosophy. A final essay examines why this advocate of a "tranquil universal philosophy" ended up being burned at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition. While the essays take many different approaches, they are united by a number of assumptions: that, although well versed in magic, Bruno cannot be defined primarily as a Renaissance Magus; that his aim was to articulate a new philosophy of nature; and that his thought, while based on ancient and medieval sources, represented a radical rupture with the philosophical schools of the past, helping forge a path toward a new modernity.<br>

  Abstract: The new science that begins to emerge at the end of the sixteenth century can be seen as a search for the order that underlies the vicissitudes of the natural world. This immediately raises the problem of the language, or languages, most appropriate for grasping and following the logic of that order. The great scientific names of the end of the sixteenth century, Galileo, Kepler, Tycho Brahe, had no doubts about the answer to that question: God wrote the universe in the language of mathematics, and the new science must learn that language in order to discover the order that<br>

  Abstract: In this passage from the ninth earl of Northumberland’s
                  Instructionsto his son, written in the Tower of London, where he was imprisoned in the early years of the seventeenth century, we find the expression of a deeply ambiguous attitude toward alchemy.¹ In the context of the impetuous developments in the new sciences that characterize the early seventeenth century, alchemy was rapidly assuming the role of an outworn discipline, pervaded by ritualistic and linguistic practices of antique origin. Furthermore, it appeared surrounded by mystery due to its obscure and occult symbolism, partly derived from magical and Hermetical influences, and partly<br>

Bruno’s lifetime in the second half of the sixteenth century thus covers a vital if often turbulent moment of cultural transition, which would radically affect the history of both science and the humanities. This chapter will primarily be concerned with his thinking about language, and especially with his thoughts about metaphor, thus aligning itself with an interpretative model of early<br>

  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud’s concept—whereby “man lives with his unconscious, not by it” (Meissner 2003, 214)—has vexed critics since its inception. That humans possess a vast reservoir of memories, perceptions, and forms of judgment cannot be denied. Indeed, Freud has been credited with an important role in setting the research agenda for contemporary cognitive psychology (e.g., Pribram and Gill 1976; Erdelyi 1985; Modell 2006; Westen, Weinberger, and Bradley 2007) and many aspects of cognitive science (e.g., Bilder and Lefever 1998; Smith 1999a; Wilson 2002).

  Chapter One  The Challenge (and Stigma) of Philosophy from:

  Abstract: What are the philosophical antecedents of Freud’s attempt to establish a science of the mind? As already briefly mentioned, during his early university days Freud explicitly rejected philosophy, because of its “speculative” character. He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science. That move heralded the series of clinical studies that would eventually emerge in the therapeutic system of psychoanalysis, a psychiatry he would consistently call a “science.” Freud never abandoned his commitment to scientific knowledge and perhaps more importantly, scientific reason.

  Abstract: When the comet Hale-Bopp made its graceful way across our skies in 1998, most informed people were impressed by its beauty and curious about the science. But a few people were driven by religious fanatics to various tragic episodes of mass-suicide. They read the comet as a message, which they interpreted in the conventional way as a sign of the Apocalypse. The contrast between these two kinds of reaction to astronomical phenomena is discernible already in the seventeenth century.

  Abstract: One of the more intractable problems in the social sciences is the problem of explaining human agency, or what is often termed the structure/action debate. The problem seems to crop up anew with each generation of practitioners, who have generated a small library on this problem alone. The very triumph of sociology, anthropology, and political science as disciplinary specialties has, however, been marked by a loss of certain categories of thought and by an ever increasing difficulty in expressing human existence in the world in terms of words and concepts that had, in a presociological era, stood at the core<br>

  Eight  The Biology of Traumatic Memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7swhj">The Harmony of Illusions</a><br>
  Abstract: The birth of PTSD followed a historical transformation in psychiatric knowledge making. Out of these changes emerged an invigorated psychiatric science that identified progress with the accumulation of facts by means of testable hypotheses: “Hypotheses prove themselves superior … by surviving strenuous attempts at disconfirmation. Science advances by the replacement of falsified theories by yet to be falsified ones” (Wallace 1988:140). Psychiatric writers associate “testability” with Karl Popper’s epistemology of falsificationism (Faust and Miner 1986). There are important differences between Popperian falsificationism and knowledge making in psychiatric science, though, and I will use the term “fallibilism” when I refer to<br>

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

  Abstract: Mathematics has been and still is commonly viewed as independent, at least essentially or constitutively independent, of narrative or other purportedly literary or rhetorical elements, such as metaphor.¹ Indeed, this independence has been deemed to be especially characteristic of mathematics as against other sciences or philosophy, which also aspire and claim to be able, sometimes on the model of mathematics, to dispense with the constitutive role of such elements. Their auxiliary, such as pedagogical, role has always been acknowledged and, more recently, investigated in historical and sociological studies of mathematics and science, for example, in considering how narrative is used<br>

Announcing a major “inversion of Platonism” in Western philosophy, they claimed that reality lies in the immediate flux of sensory appearances and not in a rational order beyond it. Our conceptual systems, they argued, are not copies of eternal forms underlying the sensory flux; they are instrumental constructs that overlie an experiential stream irreducible to rational formulation.

The common thread of the essays in this volume is a sensitivity to the pressing need to place Darwin in the context of Victorian science. The organization of the work reflects the goal of building bridges between the study of an individual and his place in scientific culture.

  Abstract: As a cognitive psychologist, my forays into the history of science have as their ultimate aim to contribute something to the psychology of thinking and the psychology of creativity. I hoped to learn from historical studies, and enrich my own rather crabbed, often Philistine field. In the course of this effort, my students and I found ourselves developing what we now call, quite provisionally, an “evolving systems approach to creative work” (Gruber 1980a, b).<br>

  8  Darwin’s Principle of Divergence as Internal Dialogue from:

  Author(s) Kohn David<br>
  Abstract: However strongly we may see scientific ideas as socially and culturally contingent in their origin and expression, we must acknowledge that they are also the products of individuals. Hence even if we all consider scientific activity to be the reworking of prior scientific activity, the dynamics by which individual scientists develop their theories is a subject integral to the history of science. If we accept the proposition that knowledge grows by public and critical dialogue, we should not ignore the fact that important phases of the dialogue may occur within an individual. Such is the case for Charles Darwin, who<br>

  Abstract: It is a fact familiar to all historians of science that Darwin was extremely slow to put his most important ideas into print. Having become a convinced transmutationist in 1837, he made such rapid progress over the next few years that he soon foresaw the prospect of writing a work that would revolutionize natural history. Yet it was not until 1844 that he produced an essay that was suitable for publication by his family in the event of his death; and fourteen years later, the unexpected arrival of Wallace’s short paper “On the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from<br>

  Abstract: In an obituary notice of 1882 examining the causes of Darwin’s success and the importance of Darwin’s works, the Genevan botanist and pioneer of the history of science Alphonse de Candolle identified two characteristics in particular that had made Darwin such an exceptional thinker. One was Darwin’s ability to occupy himself simultaneously with both the smallest details and the broadest theoretical considerations. The other was the extraordinary
                     rangeof Darwin’s researches and the way that each of Darwin’s separate studies, however specialized, contributed to the whole of Darwin’soeuvre(Candolle 1882).<br>

  Abstract: This note is a brief comment on Herbert’s interpretation of Darwin’s first chosen field of serious scientific research, the field in which he first earned respect as a highly competent “gentleman of science”. Herbert takes as her text a published comment of mine about what I termed the “dominant cognitive goal” of geologists at the period when Darwin joined their company (1979, pp. 10–11). I want to explain why this did not in fact imply a “narrow definition” of geology, and why there is therefore no paradox in identifying Darwin (and of course his older mentor Lyell) as central<br>

  Author(s) Young Robert M.<br>
  Abstract: It strikes me that there should be little need for this paper. Only positivists believe that scientific facts and theories are separate from human meanings and values, and even they, inconsistently, set out to extrapolate human and social conclusions from putatively decontextualized facts. Only religious fundamentalists believe that a belief in God cannot be reconciled with science, and that true religion is based on the literal truth of Scripture. This is a sort of religious positivism, as is the notion of creation science, which the ultra-right is currently deploying in opposition to a vulnerable, neo-Darwinian scientific orthodoxy, as part of<br>

  Abstract: Certain images spring immediately to mind whenever the scientific reaction to Darwinism is mentioned. For many, Thomas Henry Huxley’s response to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce at the Oxford BAAS meeting in 1860 symbolizes the scientists’ refusal to bow to outside pressure. Huxley’s debate with Richard Owen over man’s relationship to the apes illustrates the clash between the radical and conservative responses within science, as do the efforts of Asa Gray and William Barton Rogers to defend Darwinism against the attacks of Louis Agassiz in the United States. Many laymen no doubt assume that once the initial opposition was overcome, Darwinism soon<br>

More case studies on Germany have appeared; Professor Yvette Conry has published her large volume on French non-reactions to Darwin; and a new generation of Italian historians of science has undertaken to explore the immense and immensely under-researched territory of Italian reactions to Darwin. Yet at present, as in 1972, the task of offering a balanced comparative assessment of Darwinian debates within the major European countries proves daunting. For the most part,<br>

  Abstract: A theory of genre that will produce certainty about the real nature of literary works must await an answer to the question, “How is language possible?” Current theories that treat language “scientifically” in the narrow sense, as an object among other objects, must fail to deal adequately with the consciousness of meaning in the speaking and understanding subject. Precisely where the structuralist enterprise attempts to usurp the task of hermeneutics, as Paul Ricoeur points out, it oversteps its limits as a science.¹ On the other hand, philosophies of language that begin from the thinking subject and postulate a prelinguistic consciousness<br>

  Losing the Edge from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: The self forms at the edge of desire, and a science of self arises in the effort to leave that self behind. But more than one response is possible to the acute awareness of self that ensues from the reach of desire. Neville conceives it as a “contraction” of the self upon itself and finds it merely strange. “How curiously one is changed,” he muses. He does not appear to hate the change, nor to relish it. Nietzsche, on the other hand, is delighted: “One seems to oneself transfigured, stronger, richer, more complete; one

The ambition of science to realize itself in the notations of mathematics reflects a suspicion of the treacherous ambiguities of language dating from the seventeenth century. Exponents of the power of poetry have always made a virtue of the equivocations of its language. Meaning is a portentous term against which the literary sensibility has always had a certain prejudice. It connotes gravity and immobility, conditions inimical to imaginative freedom.

  Book Title: What's Happened to the Humanities?-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kernan Alvin<br>
  Abstract: This volume of specially commissioned original essays presents the thoughts of some of the most distinguished commentators within the American academy on the fundamental changes that have taken place in the humanities in the latter part of the twentieth century. In the transformation of American higher education from the university to the "demoversity," the humanities have become a less and less important part of education, a matter established by a statistical appendix and elaborated on in several of the essays. The individual essays offer close observations into how the humanities have been affected by declining academic status, by demographic shifts, by reductions in financial support, and by changing communication technology. They also explore the effect of these forces on books, libraries, and the phenomenology of reading in the age of images. When basic conditions change, theory follows, and several essays trace the appearance and effect of new relativistic epistemologies in the humanities. Social institutions change as well in such circumstances, and the volume concludes with studies of the new social arrangements that have developed in the humanities in recent years: the attack on professionalism and the effort to transform the humanities into the social conscience of academia and even of the nation as a whole.<br>

  Author(s) KERNAN ALVIN<br>
  Abstract: Institutionally, in the standard academic table of organization, the university catalogue—the knowledge tree of contemporary western culture—the humanities are the subjects regularly listed under that heading: literature, philosophy, art history, music, religion, languages, and sometimes history. This branch of knowledge is separated from the branch of the social sciences and from the branch of the biological and physical sciences. These three branches together form the arts and sciences, or the liberal arts, as they are sometimes known, which are as a group separated in turn from the professional disciplines—such as medicine, education, business, and law—which, at<br>

  Author(s) Avramides Anita<br>
  Abstract: Persons are subjects of thought and action; they live in a world that science has so successfully managed to understand. As subjects, persons have a very particular perspective on the world and their actions in it: call it the subjective perspective. Persons are also capable of transcending this subjective perspective and of thinking about the world and their behaviour in a detached manner. They are capable of viewing the world not just from
                  here, and from the point of view of humanity, but also of viewing itfrom nowhere in particular. The View From Nowhereis a philosophical exploration of<br>

  Abstract: The notion of a possible world is familiar from Leibniz's philosophy, especially the idea - parodied by Voltaire in
                  Candide- that the world we inhabit, theactualworld, is the best of all possible worlds. But it was primarily in the latter half of the twentieth century that possible worlds became a mainstay of philosophical theorizing. In areas as diverse as philosophy of language, philosophy of science, epistemology, logic, ethics and, of course, metaphysics itself, philosophers helped themselves to possible worlds in order to provide analyses of key concepts from their respective domains.

  Book Title: Modernist Anthropology-From Fieldwork to Text<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Manganaro Marc<br>
  Abstract: Recent insights into the nature of representation and power relations have signaled an important shift in perspective on anthropology: from a fieldwork-based "science" of culture to an interpretive activity bound to the discursive and ideological process called "text-making." This collection of essays reflects the ongoing cross-fertilization between literary criticism and anthropology. Focusing on texts written or influenced by anthropologists between 1900 and 1945, the work relates current perspectives on anthropology's discursive nature to the literary period known as "Modernism.".<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvt1j">Modernist Anthropology</a><br>
  Author(s) WEBSTER STEVEN<br>
  Abstract: Form has become important in some contemporary ethnographic writing. However, the social theory implicit in the writing cannot be easily distinguished from its form. History is obscured in this merger, which is itself historic. In the social sciences, the long-established distinction between aesthetic criticism and social science, although often questioned, seems to have become blurred in practice and problematic in theory since about the 1960s. In aesthetics and literary criticism, on the other hand, the apparent convergence has long been implicit in the conceptual framework of modernism. Since the 1970s the perhaps related processes in some of the social sciences<br>

  Abstract: The first thing that comes to mind when I hear the term “transdisciplinarity” is problem-centered investigations in contrast to “discipline-centered investigations.” Disciplines provide methods of investigation and therotical frameworks that inform the methods of inquiry. The questions asked are based on what has been accomplished in the past. Natural science is largely incremental. We build on prior work. The lattice of concepts and theories is self-reinforcing. It is only during periods of major paradigm shifts or scientific revolutions when one experiences the collapse of the entire structure. That may mean the theory has been replaced, but it doesn’t necessarily implied<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

  Abstract: When historians begin talking about political culture real social scientists are inclined to wince. To take a political culture approach even to modern politics is full of problems; to attempt a historical account of the evolution of a particular polity’s culture is fraught with so many serious methodological questions that it seems wiser, and certainly safer, to avoid the challenge altogether. In his 1983 survey of the discipline of political science, Dennis Kavanagh, of the University of Nottingham, sets out the dilemma well. Kavanagh provides a minimalist definition of political culture, first devised by Talcott Parsons and Edward Shils in<br>

  The Comparative Study of Clientelism and the Realities of Patronage in Modern Societies: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt806sg">Democracy with Justice/La juste democratie</a><br>
  Author(s) Roniger Luis<br>
  Abstract: The study of patronage and clientelism — which has burgeoned in the social sciences since the late 1960s — can be considered part of a broader reaction against evolutionary assumptions about the presumed generalized move of modern society towards Western liberal forms of political development and bureaucratic-universalism. From different vantage points, these assumptions were seriously questioned by the research of scholars who analyzed the actual operation of modern institutions. Thus, over and above their concrete contribution, works by Khayyam Paltiel on the financing of modern parties and studies on political machines by J. Scott, René Lemarchand and Keith Legg — among others —have<br>

  A Political Economy Approach to Interest Representation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt806sg">Democracy with Justice/La juste democratie</a><br>
  Author(s) Jenson Jane<br>
  Abstract: Thinking about modes of interest representation has undergone several permutations in recent years, as major alterations in post-war electoral coalitions mark the emergence of new political actors, partisan strategies, and forms of state/society and global relations. The diversity of literatures analyzing neo-corporatism, new social movements, New Left and post-modern politics indicates that the theoretical perspectives on liberal democracy which dominated political science and sociology after 1945 required reconceptualization. Moreover, since the political events provoking new theory occurred in conjunction with a profound crisis and restructuring of economic relations, even political economy approaches began to reassess representation.<br>

  Fragmentation, Improvisation, and Urban Quality: from:

  Author(s) Reeh Henrik<br>
  Abstract: Towards the end of the second millennium, the issue of whether fragmentation is part of modernity is no longer in dispute. In many spheres of human endeavour and perception, phenomena linked with fragmentation express a general diversification in social and cultural life. One only has to think of the social division of labour which has distanced architecture from engineering, and both of these professions from urban studies in the social sciences as well as in the humanities. Furthermore, fragmentation has had profound spatial consequences, since privately owned parcels of space are used for construction rather independently of one another. In<br>

  From Modernity to Postmodernity from:

  Author(s) ILCAN SUZAN<br>
  Abstract: It is not a coincidence that postmodernism and postcolonialism have materialized at the same time as objects of study in the human sciences: the one is a function of the other. The collapse of the
                  grands récitsof the Enlightenment that Jean-François Lyotard (1986) identifies as the signifying mark of postmodernity is contingent upon the end of the great European nation-state empires and of capitalism grounded in nation-states.

  Book Title: Ethics of Catholicism and the Consecration of the Intellectual-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): BÉLANGER ANDRÉ J.<br>
  Abstract: Using France as the most representative case of a Catholic context, Bélanger argues that as French society became more secularized intellectuals replaced the clergy as arbitrators of justice and enlightenment. Catholic morality was consolidated by the scholastic tradition and confirmed by the Counter-Reformation, providing the foundation that allowed the establishment of a lay elite. Bélanger describes the progressive takeover of positions of influence by the new elite in Catholic society and examines arguments used by thinkers from the seventeenth to the twentieth century to legitimize their positions. In contrast, the Anglo-Saxon Protestant tradition, due to its emphasis on the priesthood of all believers, led to recognition of the individual's conscience as the sole judge of her or his deeds and failed to provide intellectuals with the basis for any claim to serve as moral leaders in political affairs.<br>

  Abstract: “Ontology” is not a widely used word or concept in contemporary philosophy. The dominance of the perspectives of formal logic and linguistic analysis in the schools of philosophy in the academic scene has largely relegated traditional metaphysics and its interest in ontology to a purely historical account of the past. But some scientists and philosophers of science have not been satisfied with the reduction of truth to matters of formal methodology and abstractions expressed in mathematical formulae.

                  objectivistpicture of the world (including even our own bodies) as existing entirely independent of ourselves and interacting with our experience in a merely causal fashion. There is nothing wrong with this picture in its own context; if we are to study the world scientifically, then we need to set aside<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

  Abstract: Contemporary physical cosmology is a well-established and vast enterprise that includes astronomical observations, space programs, research institutions, and funding strategies. Cosmology develops fast: numerous conferences, workshops, and public lectures are held constantly, resulting in further publications of collective volumes, and numerous new studies, academic and popular, appear daily on the Internet and in bookstores. Apart from physical scientists, cosmology attracts historians and philosophers of science, as well as millions of those who adore science and trust its final word on the nature of things.

  Abstract: It is a matter of common understanding nowadays that with all respect to the grandiose achievements of modern science and cosmology in particular, scientific discourse in general, being efficient in interpreting the most nonhuman aspects of reality, feels helpless in advancing the understanding of the mystery of human persons who are those agencies that make the universe palpable and act as its voice. This hidden predicament lies in the fact that cosmology is being constructed from within the

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0sq9">The Sense of the Universe</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the tasks of the dialogue between theology and science is to elucidate in the modern scientific and philosophical context the sense of what is meant by creation of the world out of nothing (
                  creatio ex nihilo). As is often argued in current discussions on the theme, the adequate theological appropriation of the scientific approach to the study of the natural universe is possible only if nature and the universe are treated not as an “environment” for physical and biological existence, but as creation. This implies not only a dispassionate study of the universe which is contingent upon God,<br>

  Abstract: The most common reading of the parable of the Friend at Midnight (Luke 11:1-10) holds that it is about generosity, the requirement to give to those who ask, and the trust that God will supply one’s own needs. Social-science commentary, as exemplified by Bruce Malina and Richard Rohrbaugh, adds the further dimensions of patronage and hospitality in the context of honor and shame: “Thus the petitioner threatens to expose the potential shamelessness of the sleeper. By morning the entire village would know of his refusal to provide hospitality. He thus gives in to avoid public exposure as a shameless person.”¹<br>

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

  Abstract: In the years since Ian Barbour’s first set of Gifford Lectures titled
                  Religion in an Age of Science,¹ the contemporary literature on the topic of religion and science has expanded exponentially. While this extended conversation between theologians and scientists has opened up many new avenues for fruitful exchange of views on controversial issues, other “doors,” so to speak, remain closed. For example, scientific materialists consciously or unconsciously seem to be proposing the equivalent of a secular religion, that is, a belief-system opposed to the belief-systems of the various theistic religions; but their own secular belief-system can no more be proven<br>

A scientist can no longer stand apart from and objectively analyze the empirical data as was generally assumed to be the case in early modern natural science. The scientist, with his choice of experiment and equipment for accurate measurement of the data, is an integral part of the experiment and the results thereby achieved. She also has to take into account her own finite powers of perception and understanding. As<br>

I use the word “reframe” precisely because of its Heideggerian echoes. As Arendt’s extraordinarily abstruse fable “Heidegger the Fox” suggests and as much scholarship has<br>

  Book Title: Human Nature as Capacity-Transcending Discourse and Classification<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rapport Nigel<br>
  Abstract: What is it to be human? What are our specifically human attributes, our capacities and liabilities?Such questions gave birth to anthropology as an Enlightenment science. This book argues that it is again appropriate to bring "the human" to the fore, to reclaim the singularity of the word as central to the anthropological endeavor, not on the basis of thesubstanceof a human nature - "To be human is to act like this and react like this, to feel this and want this" - but in terms of species-widecapacities: capabilities for action and imagination, liabilities for suffering and cruelty. The contributors approach "the human" with an awareness of these complexities and particularities, rendering this volume unique in its ability to build on anthropology's ethnographic expertise.<br>

  Author(s) Rapport Nigel<br>
  Abstract: The issue of human nature, what it is to be human, has been the central enterprise of an ‘anthropological’ science – nominally, at least – since Immanuel Kant’s (1996) first, modern formulation of the disciplinary endeavour in the late 1700s. At the same time it has been argued that in ‘human nature’ anthropology conjures with a concept compromised beyond redemption by its essentialistic, hierarchical and exclusionary history: its role in an imperialism of male over female, adult over child, advanced over primitive, Occidental over Oriental, rational over emotional, and conscientious over brutish, as representative of the essentially human.

  Abstract: As a social science, it is characteristic of anthropology to examine the particularities of human cultures through detailed and nuanced ethnographic investigation (Crapanzano 2004; Abu Lughod 1993). In so doing, a choice is made by anthropologists as to whether or not to deploy etic distinctions between culture and nature and between human and animal – the former with the capacity ‘to produce’ in order to live (Godelier 1986) – or to work from emic constructions of like divisions and the ways in which people locally live by them, or to challenge and contest all such divisions as anthropocentric (Bateson 1999;<br>

  Abstract: One feature¹ of a museum is the performative naturalisation of ‘objective’ relations between a state² and ‘its’ culture or master narrative of descent, through changing, and sometimes deceptively diffuse and decentralised means (Duncan and Wallach 1980, Hooper Greenhill 1992).³ A museum’s task is to construct a shifting multiplicity of tableaux vivants as facets or dimensions of the state.⁴ The Israel Museum in Jerusalem is exemplary:⁵ science and evolution validate the narrative of descent and warrant the cultural-historical blue-print. The cradle of civilisation is presented through archaeology, sacred texts⁶, history, contemporary art, and prestigious travelling exhibitions.⁷ Exhibits convey a sense of<br>

  Abstract: Between 1988 and 1990 I carried out ethnographic fieldwork in the Science Museum, London – Britain’s national museum of science and industry, generally acknowledged to be one of the world’s major science museums. Looking back, I can still feel the tremor of excitement I felt on first being permitted to go ‘backstage’ with my own key to use doors – half-hidden by displays – at the back of galleries leading to what seemed initially like a maze of footfall-echoey spiral staircases and further mysterious doors, behind the scenes. The world which I was exploring as an ethnographer was quite literally divided into ‘back<br>

  Book Title: Between Educationalization and Appropriation-Selected Writings on the History of Modern Educational Systems<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vervenne Marc<br>
  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: The long list of questions issued by the organizers of this seminar is, we assume, primarily heuristic in intent. Rather than formulating a response to them all, therefore, we have concentrated on a single theme. It takes its relevance from the point of view of the discipline in which we as researchers have profiled ourselves, namely educational historiography. This contemporary variant of what was previously often termed “the history of pedagogy” still may be institutionally associated with the “educational sciences” but does not necessarily coincide with it as part of fundamental research².

  Author(s) Depaepe M.<br>
  Abstract: One of Jürgen Oelkers’ many merits is to have studied – as a generalist – the complex relationship between pedagogy, politics and practice in great detail, especially in relation to ›reform pedagogy‹ (or New Education) and its potential contribution to educational innovations (see, e.g., Oelkers 1991; Oelkers/Osterwalder 1999; Oelkers ³1996). Based on such a position, the ›relevance‹ of historical research in educational sciences, at first glance, does not seem very problematic. Scientific knowledge that is based on empirical analytical research as well as on philosophically and historically acquired insights is, from this point of view, essential for formulating the future<br>

  Abstract: As we’ve often said in the past, historical research presents certain problems for the behavioural sciences. When we think about the history of education, can it, as the title of this book seems to suggest, be conceived of simply as a subdivision of educational research? And does the argumentative structure that is developed in this domain of knowledge automatically give rise to the construction of ‘one’, let alone, ‘the’ language of education? In our opinion, the history of education, if it wants to be valid, must in any event bear the stamp of what Michel de Certeau once called the<br>

  Book Title: Origins and Ends of the Mind-Philosophical Essays on Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis claims that the individual human mind is structured by its childhood relationships with its parents. But the theory of attachment, evolutionary psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind have all recently re-introduced new dimensions of innateness into mental development and pathology. If attachment is an instinct, then what is the psychological status of the child's relation to the mother? If the mind is in part a product of evolution, then how far down do the inhibitory mechanisms of the mind go? If the mind of the child is shaped by their encounter with a set of prohibitions, how, in the light of contemporary 'cognitive science' and philosophy of mind, can the child be conceived as 'taking on' a rule? How is the construction of the mind related to the normative ends of cognitive experience? Today, it is Lacanian psychoanalysis which most vigorously defends psychoanalytic theory and practice from the encroachment of the biological and 'cognitive' sciences. But a paradigm shift nevertheless appears to be underway, in which the classical psychoanalytic theories about the Oedipus complex, primary and secondary repression, sexual difference and psychosexuality, the role of symbols,etc, are being dismantled and reintegrated into a new synthesis of biological and psychological theories. In this collection of theoretical essays by philosophers and psychoanalysts, encounters are brought about between Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis on the one hand, and attachment theory, evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind on the other.<br>

  Book Title: Subversion, Conversion, Development-Cross-Cultural Knowledge Exchange and the Politics of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Lee<br>
  Abstract: This book explores alternative cultural encounters with and around information technologies. These encounters are alternative because they counter dominant, Western-oriented notions of media consumption; they include media practices as forms of cultural resistance and subversion, "DIY cultures," and other nonmainstream models of technology production. The contributors -- leading thinkers in science and technology studies, anthropology, and software design -- pay special attention to the specific inflections that different cultures and communities give to the value of knowledge. The richly detailed accounts presented here challenge the dominant view of knowledge as a neutral good -- information available for representation and encoding but separated from all social relations. The chapters examine specific cases in which the forms of knowledge and cross-cultural encounters are shaping technology use and development. They consider design, use, and reuse of technological tools, including databases, GPS devices, books, and computers, in locations that range from Australia and New Guinea to Germany and the United States.ContributorsPoline Bala, Alan Blackwell, Wade Chambers, Michael Christie, Hildegard Diemberger, Stephen Hugh-Jones, James Leach, Jerome Lewis, Dawn Nafus, Gregers Petersen, Marilyn Strathern, David Turnbull, Helen Verran, Laura Watts, Lee Wilson<br>

Shakespeare’s Prospero pondered it, as did Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and H. G. Wells’s Dr. Moreau. But the gap between fantasy and actual technological capacity is closing, so that now the morality of power must speak to the governance of power; ethics must inform public policy.

  Abstract: Modern American jurisprudential studies began when the dean of Harvard University Law School, Christopher Columbus Langdell, published the first modern law school casebook, Selection of Cases on the Law of Contracts, in 1871. Langdell’s casebook ushered in the modern era because it offered a new methodology and pedagogy for law study that was nothing more than an expression of faith in the scientific method.

One fact remains clear: this movement coincided with the rise of interdisciplinary legal studies and the growing disenchantment with the legal process and fundamental rights schools. In the midst of the disintegration of and disillusionment with mainstream jurisprudence, legal scholars looked outside law to economics for law’s missing authority and the autonomy of legal discourse. Of all the social sciences, economics was the most promising candidate offering “right answers” for law’s problems.<br>

In science fiction, all phenomena and events described are theoretically possible under the laws of physics, even though they may not at present be achievable. Stated in this way, it would appear that works belonging to the genre would be easily identifiable.

  Book Title: Biography and turning points in Europe and America-  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Négroni Catherine<br>
  Abstract: This sociological collection advances the argument that the concept of a turning point expands our understanding of life experiences from a descriptive to a deeper and more abstract level of analysis. It addresses the conceptual issue of what distinguishes turning points from life transitions in general and raises crucial questions about the application of turning points as a biographical research method. Biography and turning points in Europe and America is all the more distinctive and significant due to its broad empirical database. The anthology includes authors from ten different countries, providing a number of contexts for thinking about how turning points relate to constructions of meaning shaped by globalization and by cultural and structural meanings unique to each country. The book will be useful across a wide range of social sciences and particularly valuable for researchers needing a stronger theoretical base for biographical work.<br>

We would suggest that this literature offers important insights into how vocabularies of expertise have been used throughout modernity diverting attention from the human significance of what suffering does to people (Wilkinson, 2005).

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Abstract: In the eyes of most scientists, and of educated laypeople, understanding is a central goal of science. In the past centuries scientific research has enormously increased our understanding of the world. Indeed, it seems a commonplace to state that the desire for understanding is a chief motivation for doing science. But despite the prima facie plausibility of these claims, it is not so clear what their precise content is. What do we mean when we say that scientists understand, for example, global climate change? What is involved in achieving scientific understanding of phenomena, be they the origin of the universe,<br>

In this book Schrödinger argues that science, since it is a Greek invention and is based on the Greek way of thinking, is “something special,” that is, “it is not the only possible way of thinking about Nature.” Schrödinger then poses the following question: “What are the peculiar, special traits of our scientific world-picture?” and he answers it immediately by stating: “About one of these fundamental features there can be no doubt.

  Abstract: Philosophers of science have a long tradition of making a connection between explanation and understanding, but only lately have they started to give the latter notion a substantial role in their theories. The reason is because understanding is an even more difficult notion than explanation. To my mind, the recent interest in understanding (exemplified by this volume), springs from the fact that explanation is a cognitive activity, and for too long theories of explanation have dismissed the cognitive dimension with the weak excuse of its being a too “subjective” ingredient for a theory of

One of its great successes is its impressive track record of giving explanations of natural phenomena, by which these phenomena are made understandable. This much is generally granted, but things become less clear when one asks what these physical explanations exactly consist in. Philosophers of science have proposed a variety of analyses of explanation (nomological-deductive, causal, unification, to mention but a few), and it is not immediately obvious which of these proposals best captures physical practice.<br>

  Author(s) EIGNER KAI<br>
  Abstract: Since Thomas Kuhn’s characterization of science by means of a list of epistemic values that provide “
                     theshared basis for theory choice,” there is a debate in philosophy of science about what the epistemic values of science are (for example, Kuhn 1977; McMullin 1983; Longino 1990; Lacey 2005). Kuhn’s list comprised such values as empirical accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness (Kuhn 1977, 321–22), which, as he argued, can be seen as constitutive of science. An enterprise could have different criteria for judging theories, but then it would not be science (331).<br>

  Abstract: I have this wonderful idea for a science fiction story. A group of young people invent a time machine. They plan to return to the Rome of Julius Caesar so that they can write the best term paper ever on the Rome of Julius Caesar. But they make a mistake in setting the controls and end up in Jerusalem on the fourteenth day of the month of Nisan in the year 30 C.E. (though of course that’s not how it was being counted then).<br>

  Abstract: Yesterday we reached the problem of certitude of judgment that is raised when one attempts to integrate the modern notion or fact of science with the ancient ideal. And we had something to say about the nature of the act of judgment, the nature of sufficient evidence, the objectifications of intellectual light, of the light of intelligence, in logic and method, and the remainder that never succeeds in being objectified. In other words, intelligence is something more than simply what can be objectified in logic or a method, no matter how elaborate. Not all problems are the same, and yet<br>

  Abstract: The day before yesterday, I did most of the first chapter on method, and first of all I noted that there are three approaches to the notion of method: first, a purely empirical approach, where method is more an art than a science; secondly, a selective approach, where one picks the successful science and analyzes it and wishes all other sciences to be science insofar as they conform to it; that’s quite unsatisfactory for the less successful sciences that need more help really than anyone else; and consequently we were trying to work out a third approach through an analysis<br>

  Abstract: We continue with ‘Horizons and Categories.’ Last time I spoke of the meaning of horizon, comparison of horizons, distinguishing them as complementary, genetic, and dialectical, and the differences of structure in horizons. I went on to method as horizon, and in particular to the difference between the traditional Aristotelian approach, however qualified, and the implications of horizon. Particularly the notion of necessity was fundamental in Aristotelian science, and it is marginal in modern science. We dealt with the many implications of that, especially with regard to the way the context of the statement of a truth is conceived, whether it<br>

  Abstract: MAN AND HIS WORLD – the theme of this world exposition – must appeal to the mind and heart of every scientist. It is the very essence of science, and its historic mission, to explore the laws of the world which surrounds man, to learn to use these laws and through their use to govern the world for the benefit of man. Science frees humanity from blind dependence on the play of natural and social forces and opens the road to a happier future for coming generations.

Before the first landings of mechanical devices and cameras on the moon, no one knew whether the moon was thick with dust or not. Before close photographs were taken of Mars, it was widely supposed to be covered with canals, although some astronomers had speculated that these might be optical illusions.

  Abstract: MY SUBJECT in this lecture is perhaps more concerned with the human reaction to cosmology rather than with cosmology itself, since I have become more and more fascinated with the way the human muid responds to changes and advances in science. Cosmology excites particularly strong, varied and interesting responses, for the subject matter is the structure and history of the universe as a whole. It is therefore not in the least surprising that people have been fascinated by it for thousands of years. Nor is it surprising that it belongs among the most speculative and rapidly varying subjects in the<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the articulations that have emerged over the last half-century between various types of holism, Chinese medicine and systems biology. Given the discipline’s historical attachments to a definition of ‘medicine’ that rather narrowly refers to biomedicine as developed in Europe and the US from the eighteenth century onwards, the medical humanities are not the most obvious starting point for such an inquiry. At the same time, they do offer one advantage over neighbouring disciplines like a medical history, anthropology or science and technology studies for someone like myself, a clinician as well as a historian and anthropologist: their<br>

The term has since come to mean empirical, experimentally acquired knowledge and, as such, refers to some of the most powerful tools we have for understanding the world and indeed our own physiology. Scientific medicine has led to huge improvements in outcomes from a variety of conditions, from infectious diseases to cancer and heart disease. These advances have come, largely, from a mechanistic or reductionist approach to illness, which focuses on putting the body, understood as a physical<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the articulations that have emerged over the last half-century between various types of holism, Chinese medicine and systems biology. Given the discipline’s historical attachments to a definition of ‘medicine’ that rather narrowly refers to biomedicine as developed in Europe and the US from the eighteenth century onwards, the medical humanities are not the most obvious starting point for such an inquiry. At the same time, they do offer one advantage over neighbouring disciplines like a medical history, anthropology or science and technology studies for someone like myself, a clinician as well as a historian and anthropologist: their<br>

  Author(s) Waugh Patricia<br>
  Abstract: In styles that range from the performatively paratactic and experimental, to scholarly sobriety and sharp sociocultural critique, these chapters engage issues concerning the contemporary uses and forms of experiment and the building and distribution of kinds of evidence in relation to new concepts and practices of experimentation within the contemporary biomedical sciences. They explore some less obvious ways in which knowledges and practices forged in this new ‘megaphone’ science resonate far beyond conventional spaces of research and are deeply and reciprocally entangled with the embodied self-fashioning of individual selves and group identities.¹ Everywhere, not only in postmodern theory or art,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bgzddd">The Edinburgh Companion to the Critical Medical Humanities</a><br>
  Author(s) Wistreich Richard<br>
  Abstract: ‘Dissection might be thought of as a self-explanatory term.’ So begins Jonathan Sawday’s
                  The Body Emblazoned: Dissection and the Human Body in Renaissance Culture(1995), one of the earliest cultural histories to contribute to the burgeoning field of medical humanities in the 1990s. ‘In its medical sense’, he explains, ‘a dissection suggests the methodical division of an animal body for the purposes of “critical examination”.’ But the term can be used in a ‘metaphoric sense’ too, and when it is we are led ‘to an historical field rich in cognate meanings’ in a period when a ‘“science” of the body<br>

  Author(s) Gallagher Shaun<br>
  Abstract: Science (from the Latin,
                  scientia) originally meant knowledge, so that ‘natural science’ meant knowledge of the natural world and of its laws. The term has since come to mean empirical, experimentally acquired knowledge and, as such, refers to some of the most powerful tools we have for understanding the world and indeed our own physiology. Scientific medicine has led to huge improvements in outcomes from a variety of conditions, from infectious diseases to cancer and heart disease. These advances have come, largely, from a mechanistic or reductionist approach to illness, which focuses on putting the body, understood as a physical<br>

  A Century of Transition in the Philosophy of Science from:

  Author(s) Jones-Imhotep Edward<br>
  Abstract: Philosophy of science, in the past 100 years, has been propelled forward by the rapid expansion of the natural sciences, and by the coincidental rise of analytic philosophy. Many of the core issues galvanized in the philosophy of science from the 1930s through the 1960s continue to be debated – for example, the nature of causation, the realism/anti-realism controversy in science, and the intricacies of what constitutes scientific explanation.¹ Perhaps less appreciated as a trend in the philosophy of science, however, is the inclusion into the discipline of explanations and theories that have a social or sociological aspect.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Stone Alison<br>
  Abstract: Nineteenth-century philosophy can be broadly characterised by several themes: the conflict between metaphysics and religious faith on the one hand and the empirical sciences on the other; a new focus on history, progress and evolution; new ideas of individuality, society and revolution; and ever-increasing concerns about nihilism.¹ This volume provides a re-examination of nineteenth-century philosophy in terms of these and other themes distinctive of the period.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Huneman Philippe<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century the natural sciences underwent a radical transformation. The paradigms of many of the disciplines that we know today, such as geology, chemistry, thermodynamics, cell biology or evolutionary biology, were established in this period. Prior to this period, knowledge of nature was a part of philosophy, as the examples of Leibniz or Descartes show. Moreover, the Kantian critique of metaphysics from the
                  Critique of Pure Reasononwards had a profound impact on philosophers, especially in Germany. Kant dismissed the traditional objects of philosophical inquiry such as God, the world and the soul, which for Kant were to<br>

  Author(s) Outhwaite William<br>
  Abstract: This chapter will examine social philosophy in the nineteenth century in terms of three interrelated processes: the consolidation of a conception of society or the social; the reformulation of issues of poverty and inequality in the form of ‘the social question’ and related attempts at social regulation; and the emergence of the social sciences ‘between literature and science’ (see Lepenies [1985] 1988). Although the term ‘rise’ may seem to suggest an inevitable or desirable process, we shall see that the status of the social sciences and the relation between the social and the political were no less contentious at the<br>

  Author(s) Summerfield Penny<br>
  Abstract: Oral history has a salience and familiarity at the beginning of the twenty-first century that is both popular and academic. The oral telling of public and personal histories is an everyday event on radio and television and in film, as well as occupying a recognised place within the scholarly practices of numerous academic disciplines, including anthropology, education, history, geography, political science and sociology.¹ Oral history offers several benefits to the discipline of English. Interviews with literary authors, as well as recordings of personal experiences of cultural phenomena such as theatre-going and reading, are available for study in collections in, for<br>

  Abstract: Visual images have been the object of study for a variety of disciplines for as long as those disciplines have existed. They include art history in the humanities, most obviously, but also, within the social sciences, the sub-disciplines of visual anthropology and visual sociology. Geography has long understood maps and photographs as central to its project (Harley 1992; Matless 1996; Cosgrove 1998), and clearly many natural sciences use various kinds of images as evidence for their claims. More recently, however, certain kinds of images, and some discipline-specific modes of approaching them, have started to cross those disciplinary boundaries, with interesting<br>

  Author(s) Alsop Rachel<br>
  Abstract: What is ethnography? Is it relevant to English studies? And, if so, how? This chapter is concerned with these questions. In academia, ethnography as a research methodology is typically associated with the social sciences, most usually, although not exclusively, with the discipline of anthropology. It is chiefly a qualitative research strategy that relies primarily on participant observation and concerns itself in its most general sense with the study and interpretation of cultural behaviour. The conventional image of the ethnographer is the academic who goes out into the field (traditionally a distant land of whose people and way of life little<br>

  Abstract: Utilitarianism was a minority position in nineteenth-century English philosophy. After many twists and turns, it gradually spread across all branches of modern knowledge: economics, animal ethics, morality, political science, and law. This ‘consequentialist’ moral theory focuses on an action’s consequences, and not on an action’s intention or intrinsic value. The theory recommends acting so that every being’s well-being increases.

  2  The Politics of Neuroscience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r21s0">The Political Mind</a><br>
  Abstract: The neurological material in the foregoing chapter operates within an ontology and epistemology that many in the social sciences have long fought against. At its hard scientific edge, this belief holds that human behaviour is fully explicable through close study of the operations of the brain. All social science and theory would therefore, in time, be superseded by an all-embracing explanatory vocabulary of neurophysiological brainstates. Before we can proceed to unpack such material for use in a political context, this fundamental concern must first be addressed.<br>

  Abstract: ‘Once is never’ – this phrase, according to Peter Szondi, encapsulates the golden rule of science and all verifiable knowledge in general. What occurs only once poses something intolerable and indeed impossible for scientific thinking: it cannot be verified and so escapes the order of knowledge as the ground of certainty. How can we be certain of what happens only once?

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r26kb">The Discursive Construction of National Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: Since the 1970s, the term ‘discourse’ has become common currency in an everyday research sense in a variety of humanities and social science disciplines, including the applied branches of linguistics. Because of the wide-ranging use of this term, a variety of meanings have been attributed to it (see Ehlich 1993, p. 145, and Ehlich 1994), which has led to considerable semantic fuzziness and terminological flexibility. In the following we will briefly describe the concept of discourse as it is currently employed in the context of the research activities carried out at the University of Vienna, which have also informed the<br>

  Abstract: A focus group, also called a group interview or group discussion, is in essence ‘a discussion among a number of participants on a certain topic predetermined by a moderator …, which serves to collect information’ (Lamnek 1989, p. 121). Whereas this method has not been widely used in social science, group interviews are common in market research to investigate consumer motivation and behaviour. In the German-speaking countries, this method was occasionally employed by the Frankfurt Institute of Social Research in the 1950s, and in Austria it has recently been used in the reception analysis of tabloid print media by Bruck<br>

  Abstract: Over the last ten to fifteen years, psychoanalysis, and especially Lacanian theory, has emerged as one of the most important resources in the ongoing re-orientation of contemporary political theory and critical analysis. So much so is now acknowledged even in mainstream political science fora. For example, in a critical review essay recently published in the 
                  British Journal of Politics and International Relations – one of the journals of the UK Political Studies Association – and characteristically entitled ‘The Politics of Lack’, one reads that ‘an approach to politics drawn from Lacanian psychoanalysis is becoming increasingly popular of late among theorists . .<br>

  Author(s) Wandibba Simiyu<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘museum’ is derived from the Greek word 
                     mouseion. In ancient Greece, the mouseion was the temple of the muses, the goddesses of the arts and sciences, upon whom writers called for inspiration before beginning to work. Thus, as originally conceived, the mouseion implied an environment suited to creative inspiration. By about 300 BC, this word was used to designate a library and research area in Alexandria, Egypt. In other words, the earliest known museum in the modern sense of the term was actually built in Africa.<br>

  Book Title: Scandalous Knowledge-Science, Truth and the Human<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Herrnstein Smith Barbara<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the radical reconceptions of knowledge and science emerging from constructivist epistemology, social studies of science, and contemporary cognitive science. Smith reviews the key issues involved in the twentieth-century critiques of traditional views of human knowledge and scientific truth and gives an extensively informed explanation of the alternative accounts developed by Fleck, Kuhn, Foucault, Latour, and others. She also addresses the various anxieties (e.g., over ‘relativism’) and ‘wars’ occasioned by these developments, placing them in their historical contexts and arguing that they are largely misplaced or spurious. Smith then examines the currently perplexed relations between the natural and human sciences, the grandiose claims and dubious methods of evolutionary psychology, and the complex play of naturalist, humanist, and posthumanist ideologies in contemporary views of the relation between humans and animals.<br>

  Book Title: Modernism and Magic-Experiments with Spiritualism, Theosophy and the Occult<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Leigh<br>
  Abstract: While modernism’s engagement with the occult has been approached by critics as the result of a loss of faith in representation, an attempt to draw on science as the primary discourse of modernity, or as a hidden history of ideas, Leigh Wilson argues that these discourses have at their heart a magical practice which remakes the relationship between world and representation. As Wilson demonstrates, the courses of the occult are based on a magical mimesis which transforms the nature of the copy, from inert to vital, from dead to alive, from static to animated, from powerless to powerful. Wilson explores the aesthetic and political implications of this relationship in the work of those writers, artists and filmmakers who were most self-consciously experimental, including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Dziga Vertov and Sergei M. Eisenstein.<br>

  Abstract: In both the United States and the United Kingdom, the field of intelligence studies represents one of the fastest growing subsets of international history, political science and strategic studies. This dynamism is evidenced not only by the vast volume of publications that are generated, but by the existence of dedicated departments and centres, specialist degree programmes, conferences and professional associations. In the US, intelligence is taught at a host of top universities, typically in the form of advanced option courses and special subjects. Beyond this, there are institutes specifically designed to prepare students for entry-level positions in the intelligence community,<br>

  Book Title: Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis was the most important intellectual development of the twentieth century, which left no practice from psychiatry to philosophy to politics untouched. Yet it was also in many ways an untouchable project, caught between science and poetry, medicine and hermeneutics. This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapters pinpointed a new form of the ancient relationship between ‘slavery’ and ‘alienation’ emerging at the origins of psychoanalysis in the form of the relationship between drug-addiction and sexuality. The first chapter also showed how this emergence was coterminous with Freud’s forced transition from scientific experimentation to linguistic interlocution; that is, it entailed Freud’s departure from a strictly scientific field and directed him into situations that, while never abandoning a guiding ideal of science, required supplementation by the extra-scientific armature derived from a form of attentiveness to ‘literature’. In terms of the ‘therapy’ offered by psychoanalysis, this required<br>

  Abstract: The selection combines the theoretical side of Rousseau’s thought, which is primarily of interest to students of political science and of intellectual history, with the more purely literary components of the works. It also provides the means to make connections between these two aspects of the work, by including such texts as the “Essay on the Origins of Language,” in which the link between Rousseau’s reflections on language and his political theory becomes manifest.

  Abstract: ‘Welsh modernist poetry’ would seem to be something of a category error. The term has almost no critical currency – unlike, say, Irish or Scottish modernism – and there might seem at first glance to be little need for it. Who would it include? How would it be configured? What would be its distinctive features – its equivalent of MacDiarmid’s
                  ‘Caledonian antisyzygy’or Joyce’s forging of ‘the uncreated conscience of my race’? So readily is Welsh writing subsumed in English or British writing that answers to these questions will not occur readily to most students of modernism. In the last ten years, however,<br>

The essays, which are organized into three sections-history and method, presence, and reception-take up fundamental issues such as spectatorship, empathy, ethics, theater as literature, and the essence of live performance. While some essays challenge assertions made by critics and historians of theater and performance, others analyze the assumptions of manifestos that prescribe how practitioners should go about creating texts and performances.

  Abstract: Approaches to the analysis of international relations using formal methods are now well established. Models of international relations problems appear frequently in many of the leading journals. While there are still those who hold that formal methods only manage to render obscure what had hitherto been clear, the achievements of such methods, commonplace in all the other social sciences, make such positions hard to justify. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the principles behind formalization. I also wish to justify its extensive use, mainly by conceptual argument and by referring very briefly to some of the achievements. These<br>

  Abstract: The application of neuroscience to fields beyond medicine¹ has been characterized as revolutionary, akin to the industrial and information revolutions (Lynch 2009, 10) and evidence of the birth of a “neurosociety” in which all domains of life and knowledge production are (or soon will be) under the sign of the “neuro.” Each day, it seems, the popular press reports new neuroscientific findings with breathless wonder.

  Abstract: Neuroscience research is increasingly informing ethics scholarship and ethics practices under the impetus of the fields of the neuroscience of ethics and of social neuroscience. This neuroturn within the field of ethics promises to enhance understanding of ourselves and of our fellow human beings. It has been argued that this knowledge will be a route to foster happiness in individual lives and the foundation of brain-based ethical norms and behaviors that will lead to greater social well-being (Changeux 1996, 1981). For example, Gazzaniga states that neuroscience will bring radical changes to ethics: “Neuroethics is more than just bioethics for the<br>

  Abstract: Melissa M. Littlefield and Jenell M. Johnson provide an initial framework for this most recent of "turns" by bringing together 14 original essays by scholars from the humanities, social sciences, and neurosciences. The resulting collection will appeal to neuroscientists curious about their colleagues' interest in their work; scholars and students both in established neurodisciplines and in disciplines such as sociology or English wondering about how to apply neuroscience findings to their home disciplines; and to science, technology, and society scholars and students interested in the roles of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in the construction of knowledge.<br>

  Book Title: Strung Together-The Cultural Currency of String Theory as a Scientific Imaginary<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Sean<br>
  Abstract: In
      Strung Together: The Cultural Currency of String Theory as a Scientific Imaginary,Sean Miller examines the cultural currency of string theory, both as part of scientific discourse and beyond it. He demonstrates that the imaginative component of string theory is both integral and indispensable to it as a scientific discourse. While mathematical arguments provide precise prompts for physical intervention in the world, the imaginary that supplements mathematical argument within string theory technical discourse allows theorists to imagine themselves interacting with the cosmos as an abstract space in such a way that strings and branes as phenomena become substantiated and legitimized. And it is precisely this sort of imaginary-which Miller calls ascientific imaginary-duly substantiated and acculturated, that survives the move from string theory technical discourse to popularizations and ultimately to popular and literary discourses. In effect, a string theory imaginary legitimizes the science itself and helps to facilitate a virtual domestication of a cosmos that was heretofore remote, alien, and incomprehensible.<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

  Abstract: The dangers of misapplied science, fully realized in the Salem witchcraft trials and the events’ larger context in Royal Society debates, put tremendous pressure on the science of the soul. By the late-seventeenth century, Harvard-trained ministers and Royal Society natural philosophers continued to advance their practices, though with renewed caution, aware both of mechanical philosophy’s limitations and the parameters surrounding empirical inquiry—especially interdictions against studying preternatural phenomena. Yet neither New England ministers nor London natural philosophers abandoned efforts to apply empirical methods to advance knowledge of God. Rather, such theologians as Samuel Clarke recuperated the goal of knowing the<br>

  Book Title: Understanding Health Inequalities and Justice-New Conversations across the Disciplines<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): Walker Rebecca L.<br>
  Abstract: The need for informed analyses of health policy is now greater than ever. The twelve essays in this volume show that public debates routinely bypass complex ethical, sociocultural, historical, and political questions about how we should address ideals of justice and equality in health care. Integrating perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, medicine, and public health, this volume illuminates the relationships between justice and health inequalities to enrich debates.
      Understanding Health Inequalities and Justiceexplores three questions: How do scholars approach relations between health inequalities and ideals of justice? When do justice considerations inform solutions to health inequalities, and how do specific health inequalities affect perceptions of injustice? And how can diverse scholarly approaches contribute to better health policy? From addressing patient agency in an inequitable health care environment to examining how scholars of social justice and health care amass evidence, this volume promotes a richer understanding of health and justice and how to achieve both.The contributors are Judith C. Barker, Paula Braveman, Paul Brodwin, Jami Suki Chang, Debra DeBruin, Leslie A. Dubbin, Sarah Horton, Carla C. Keirns, J. Paul Kelleher, Nicholas B.

  Book Title: Doing Emotions History-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): STEARNS PETER N.<br>
  Abstract: How do emotions change over time? When is hate honorable? What happens when love is translated into different languages? Such questions are now being addressed by historians who trace how emotions have been expressed and understood in different cultures throughout history. Doing Emotions History explores the history of feelings such as love, joy, grief, nostalgia as well as a wide range of others, bringing together the latest and most innovative scholarship on the history of the emotions. Spanning the globe from Asia and Europe to North America, the book provides a crucial overview of this emerging discipline. An international group of scholars reviews the field's current status and variations, addresses many of its central debates, provides models and methods, and proposes an array of possibilities for future research. Emphasizing the field's intersections with anthropology, psychology, sociology, neuroscience, data-mining, and popular culture, this groundbreaking volume demonstrates the affecting potential of doing emotions history.<br>

  Book Title: Cannibal Metaphysics-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Skafish Peter<br>
  Abstract: The iconoclastic Brazilian anthropologist and theoretician Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, well known in his discipline for helping initiate its "ontological turn," offers a vision of anthropology as "the practice of the permanent decolonization of thought." After showing that Amazonian and other Amerindian groups inhabit a radically different conceptual universe than ours-in which nature and culture, human and nonhuman, subject and object are conceived in terms that reverse our own-he presents the case for anthropology as the study of such "other" metaphysical schemes, and as the corresponding critique of the concepts imposed on them by the human sciences. Along the way, he spells out the consequences of this anthropology for thinking in general via a major reassessment of the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, arguments for the continued relevance of Deleuze and Guattari, dialogues with the work of Philippe Descola, Bruno Latour, and Marilyn Strathern, and inventive treatments of problems of ontology, translation, and transformation. Bold, unexpected, and profound,
      Cannibal Metaphysicsis one of the chief works marking anthropology's current return to the theoretical center stage.<br>

  Author(s) KLEIN JULIE THOMPSON<br>
  Abstract: Debates on digital humanities are sites of boundary work in a history of arguments about the nature of the field. Boundary work is a composite label for the claims, activities, and structures by which individuals and groups create, maintain, break down, and reformulate boundaries between knowledge units (Fisher 13–14; Klein,
                  Crossing1–2). Thomas Gieryn coined the term in 1983 in a study of demarcating science from non-science. It is an ideological style that constructs boundaries rhetorically in three ways: by expanding authority or expertise into domains claimed by other professions or occupations, by monopolizing authority and resources, and<br>

In digital humanities (DH), we see this turn in Matthew Kirschenbaum’s (2007) forensic analysis of computer hard disks; platform studies that investigate the relationship between computing culture, consoles, and other hardware (Monfort and Bogost 2009); and maker cultures that explore the humanities through practical experimentation (Dieter and Lovink 2014).

  Abstract: In 2000, Ian Hacking, the renowned philosopher and historian of science, published a book titled
                  The Social Construction of What?Written during the science wars of the 1990s and published a few years after the infamous Sokal hoax in 1996, Hacking’s study provided a trenchant critique of the various constructivist theories that influenced academic discourse at a time when scholars in all fields sought to expose the constructed nature of ever more phenomena. Although polemical at times, the main goal of the book was less to expose the fashion-driven nature of academic discourse than to clarify the distinct—and at<br>

  1  HUMAN NATURE AFTER KANT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt828">Bioaesthetics</a><br>
  Abstract: There are good reasons to begin our discussion of bioaesthetics with Kant, who published at a time when academic disciplines were still being established and the “two cultures” did not yet exist.¹ Aesthetics, indeed, was a new academic discipline defined by the German philosopher Gottlieb Alexander Baumgarten in 1750 as the “science of sensory knowledge.” Aesthetics, according to Baumgarten, was meant to clarify the relation between the sensory data based on human experience, on the one hand, and the scientific knowledge that could be derived from that data via the use of reason, on the other. In his

  Abstract: To enter this world is to navigate it. To discern the dynamics of the zone of encounter folded into the fissure between meeting and nonmeeting, a different approach is needed—methodologically as well as environmentally. In the human sciences it has been customary to call efforts to provide an enriched account of human experience interdisciplinary. Psychologists studying human behavior in public places rarely refer to the design of those places, while urban designers hardly ever consult choreographers. Human geographers study the features of the physical environment that promote the coming together of people into villages and town, while sociologists, assuming<br>

  Abstract: I want to give two examples of practices that illustrate the poetic disposition needed to begin to discern the distinctive character of the meeting place. One is taken from psychiatry, the other from the human sciences of the central Australian Arrernte people. They would not normally be construed as related. Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault, the

  Abstract: Like the story of Adam and Eve where hominids once lived in paradise and were then exiled for disobeying God’s commandment not to eat from the tree of knowledge, the story of contemporary green ecology either seems to be that once there was an idyllic and harmonious nature that was then destroyed through the advent of humans, or that once nature and hominids lived in harmony only to have this harmony destroyed by the advent of modern science, technology, and capitalist economy. The story runs that something has upset the balance of nature and that we must return to equilibrium.<br>

  Abstract: Japanese detective fiction of the early twentieth century challenged its own generic norms by blurring the boundary between fiction and reality, between legitimate academic endeavor and vulgar thrill. Behind this haze at the periphery of detective fiction, the dichotomy between hero (detective) and villain (criminal), the genre’s central setup, was also being undermined. Prominent but deranged agents of science—such as research scientists, engineers, and doctors—started to appear more often as serial killers than as models of scientific morality. Such sinister representations of scientists are somewhat at odds with both the contemporary state ideology toward and the popular understanding<br>

  Abstract: Martin Heidegger’s destructive phenomenology has shown that modern philosophy, from Descartes through Kant and Hegel to the discourse of positive science, constitutes an “anthropology” that fulfills the imperatives of a metaphysical or logocentric concept of truth and thus brings “philosophy to its end.”¹ Simultaneously, in dis-closing the temporality being that the (anthropo)logos as Word or Presence encloses (covers over and forgets), Heidegger’s destruction of the tradition points to a hermeneutics of being that is capable of surpassing metaphysics (
                  Überwindung), to a postmodern hermeneutics of dis-covery, in which a disclosed temporality is given ontological priority over Being.² What I wish to<br>

  Abstract: The post-Darwinian theory of atavism forecasted obstacles to human progress in the reappearance of throwback physical or cultural traits. In this stimulating work, Dana Seitler explores how modernity itself is an atavism. Examining late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century science, fiction, and photography, Seitler discovers how modern thought oriented itself around this paradigm of obsolescence and return—one that served to sustain ideologies of gender, sexuality, and race.<br>

  Introduction: from:

  Abstract: Modernity is an atavism. Its advent in Western culture led to and was given shape by political, social, and aesthetic developments that can be characterized by a recursive temporal subjectivity. This book provides a historical and theoretical account of that subjectivity by looking at late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century science, fition, and photography. Theories and expressions of atavism in these representational spheres reveal the way modern thought oriented itself around a paradigm of obsolescence and return that structured the experience of modern time. If “modernity” designates itself in terms of its eternal up-to-date-ness, atavism—a theory of biological reversion emerging<br>

  Author(s): NEUMANN MARK<br>
  Abstract: Why do nearly five million people travel to the Grand Canyon each year? Mark Neumann answers this question with a book as compelling as the panoramic vistas of the canyon. In On the Rim, he describes how the Grand Canyon became an internationally renowned tourist attraction and cultural icon, and delves into the meanings the place holds for the individuals who live, work, and travel there. “In the chasm’s dizzying depths and flamboyant displacement of solid ground, as well as in the perceptions of those drawn there-explorers and day-trippers, employees and outlaws, artists and fast-buck artists-Neumann discovers a context in which to examine cultural and experimental fissures that separate leisure and work, home and away, religion and science, art and life. . . .

  Abstract: The relationship between memory and history is nowadays a central preoccupation within several fields of the social sciences. Debates and reflection on the subject are most extensive and intensive within the discipline of history itself, particularly among those scholars who, recognizing that the historian’s craft extends beyond the mere “reconstruction” of what “actually” happened, deploy more complex modes of analysis in their work. An initial complexity emerges from the recognition that what “actually happened” includes the subjective perceptions and experiences of social actors. Furthermore, historical knowledge includes interpretive processes, the construction and selection of the “facts,” and the selection of<br>

It is the unrepresentable, and thus, writes Max Hernandez, it is “the unrememberable and the unforgettable.”¹ The excess of signifying that arises in what is shown and what is said that is uncontained and uncontrolled by the speaker—or filmmaker—is designated by Lacan as the real and as an “unrepresentable.” Psychoanalysis and cinema were contemporaneous developments at the end of the nineteenth century, but while the developments of Etienne-Jules Marey and the Lumières were directed toward established modernist goals of science and knowledge in relation to observable phenomenon, Sigmund Freud was developing<br>

He was also responding to the hope, or perhaps more accurately, the desire, to lift all of literary and cultural studies to the dignity of science, a desire that strongly animated French structuralism.

Moreover, the text of a linguistic narrative is also made of all sorts of discursemes that have subjects. It is now time to raise some of the many questions involved and propose some methodological directions in a field that has so often been obscured by ideological interests alien or opposed to a science of discourse.<br>

What happens when we apply some of these recent reflexive considerations that have emerged in philosophical theory to particular anthropological practices and ethnographic inscription?

Inasmuch as it focuses on a set of narratives belonging predominantly to the genres of science fiction and fantasy, this study undertakes to examine the hypothetical transformations and imaginary upheavals overtaking fictitious individuals and societies. Yet the underlying contention of this work is that science fiction and fantasy, in particular narratives drawn from media often dismissed as unserious and trivial, such as the comic book and the science fiction film, are capable of achieving profound and probing insights into the principal dilemmas of political life. Indeed, this book explores such themes as<br>

In earlier times, of course, intellectuals questioned the strictures of religious and political tradition. Some of them even served as the conscience of their epochs. But the self-perception of the intellectual as both the critic and the reformer of society, as committed to a communal project of social change, is the legacy of what the philosophe Pierre Bayle first called the “republic of letters.” Its citizens would endeavor to address popular audiences in addition to academic ones. They fervently believed that “the most fundamental ideas<br>

  Abstract: Behaviorism understands cognitive learning as a cumulative process of forming associations based on the perception of contingencies, and normative learning as a process of adopting desired modes of behavior in response to punishment and reward (that is, as a process of conditioning). From a psychoanalytic perspective, development is a matter of constructing mental patterns on the basis of the relationships experienced in early childhood. Norms are observed because the child wishes to avoid pangs of conscience (i.e., the revenge of the superego, which internalizes the fear of castration); alternatively, this occurs because the structure of biological needs has undergone change<br>

  Author(s) REHG WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: Over his long and productive career, Jürgen Habermas has pursued an overriding interest in critical social-political theory. For Habermas, as for other Frankfurt School critical theorists, social-political critique requires interdisciplinary social analysis and thus depends on engagement with the social and cultural sciences. In the 1960s, Habermas approached such engagement as a problem for methodological and epistemological reflection, that is, a matter of critique of knowledge (
                  Erkenntniskritik): critical social theory had to establish itself as a respectable, distinct form of knowledge, in large measure through a methodological critique of the then-dominant positivist philosophy of science and historicist hermeneutics. Conversely, critique<br>

  Abstract: In the 1970s, Habermas’s efforts to ground a critical theory of society underwent a “linguistic turn”; henceforth linguistic communication stood at the center of his project. Although some of his earlier writings from the 1960s had demonstrated an interest in linguistic analysis (e.g.,
                  On the Logic of the Social Sciences), the central methodological shift took shape in the 1970s. As a consequence of this shift, the formal-pragmatic analysis of communication was no longer to be understood as a metatheory seeking to provide a “language-theoretic foundation of the social sciences” (Communicative Action, 1:xxxix); instead, it provided the core element of a<br>

  Author(s) ABENSOUR MIGUEL<br>
  Abstract: This text, written in late 1971 and early 1972, is only the first part of a larger whole. Its ambition is to propose another model of interpretation than that of the classical problematic, or that of Marx and Engels’s critical operation with respect to utopias, which appears as a double salvage by transplant: rescuing the utopian orientation toward the future, and rescuing the inclination toward alterity. Marx’s theory is not the place utopian energy comes to die in order to make way for science; it is where socialist-communist utopia grows and is transformed into critical communism.

  Book Title: Neopoetics-The Evolution of the Literate Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

  Abstract: The ability to transmit symbolic signs through gestures and, later, vocal sounds eventually evolved into fully grammatical language. But as the language-ready brain was millions of years in the making, so it took perhaps as long as 200,000 years for oral cultures in separate locations, e.g., Mesopotamia, the Nile and Indus valleys, northern China, and Mesoamerica, to have the institutions in place to support the production and storage of written records. It then took millennia more before writing expanded from administrative recordkeeping to historiography, philosophy, natural science, and what we now generally mean by “literature.” All the while, writing remained<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/gay-14790">Progress and Values in the Humanities</a><br>
  Abstract: The question of progress in the humanities is an ancient one. To offer a new answer, I suggest we compare the objects of humanistic inquiry to the objects of natural science. They are radically different. To show this, I use an unusual device: the magnifying lens. Using the magnifying lens, we can distinguish two types of object: one type (objects amenable to natural science) can sustain magnification; the other type (objects typical of humanistic inquiry) cannot. I demonstrate this thesis in two slide shows; the short version summarized above, and a longer version entitled “Magnification” on my web page.¹ These<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I argued against the notion of “depth” in depth psychology and similar forms of humanistic inquiry. It serves little purpose when we use it to think about progress in the humanities. I have not concluded, therefore, that there can be no progress in humanistic enterprises. On the contrary, we can point to numerous moments of humanistic success. They are not cumulative in the way that science is. This demarcates something important about humanistic enterprises, namely that they begin anew with each new generation.<br>

  Abstract: It is easy to say what counts as progress in some endeavors: an economy progresses when it produces more wealth and better jobs, when the standard of living goes up and child mortality goes down. A science progresses when its theories explain more, with fewer anomalies, and it enhances our ability to control phenomena of interest. Medical science progresses when it helps increase the quality of life and eliminates a disease like polio. In all these cases we feel justified in using the word 
                  progress because we can cite agreed-upon measures of success. Poverty, ignorance of natural laws, diseases and<br>

                  our narratives. For American psychiatrists and many psychotherapists, this means we should use the “five-of-nine” rule and similar rules announced in the DSM-IV, the bible of psychiatry. However, by doing so we find ourselves uncannily associated with science fiction and religion and their vast efforts to solve the problem of human being.

  Book Title: Eastwood's Iwo Jima-Critical Engagements with<br>
  Publisher: Wallflower Press<br>
  Author(s): GJELSVIK ANNE<br>
  Abstract: With
      Flags of Our Fathers(2006) andLetters from Iwo Jima(2006), Clint Eastwood made a unique contribution to film history, being the first director to make two films about the same event. Eastwood's films examine the battle over Iwo Jima from two nations' perspectives, in two languages, and embody a passionate view on conflict, enemies, and heroes. Together these works tell the story behind one of history's most famous photographs, Leo Rosenthal's "Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima." In this volume, international scholars in political science and film, literary, and cultural studies undertake multifaceted investigations into how Eastwood's diptych reflects war today. Fifteen essays explore the intersection among war films, American history, and Japanese patriotism. They present global attitudes toward war memories, icons, and heroism while offering new perspectives on cinema, photography, journalism, ethics, propaganda, war strategy, leadership, and the war on terror.<br>

  Abstract: In 1968 Jacques Derrida accepted an invitation from Johns Hopkins University to teach a seminar on the topic “Literature and Truth.” The project of the seminar was to consider how literature has been conceived, constructed, and maintained from Plato on as imitation and thus construed as secondary in order to protect the status of philosophy and, more broadly, science as the province of truth. Derrida developed the argument to show that the representative arts had been subsequently burdened with the task of effacing their position as copy by cultivating the value of originality, thus reproducing the very logic that established<br>

  Abstract: If the 1970s seemed to confirm a narrative of biomedical progress due to an explosion of vaccines and novel procedures like in vitro fertilization, the next decade brought one of biomedicine’s most formidable obstacles. The first cases of HIV/AIDS were diagnosed in 1981, and their intractability shook the confidence of epidemiologists and pharmaceutical researchers. Technoscience could not invent the tools to curb, much less eradicate, this emerging infectious disease in time to prevent massive loss of life. Undaunted, countless scientists attempted to tackle all dimensions of HIV/AIDS, from its pathology and epidemiology to treatment and public health policy. One of<br>

It was now governed by a growing recognition of the evils of racism.

  Book Title: Reimagining the Sacred-Richard Kearney Debates God with James Wood, Catherine Keller, Charles Taylor, Julia Kristeva, Gianni Vattimo, Simon Critchley, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, David Tracey, Jens Zimmermann, and Merold Westphal<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

Yet the question remained whether, once disentangled from the colonial metaphysics, the termśabda-gurucould then be relocated into some indigenous context. During the late 1970s and 80s, in the wake of a postwar crisis of humanism that seemed to have afflicted the humanities and social sciences, different versions of this very move were implemented by<br>

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas-Fogiel begins with postphilosophical claims such as scientism, which she reveals to be self-refuting, for they subsume philosophy into the branches of the natural sciences. She discovers similar issues in Rorty's skepticism and strands of continental thought. Revisiting the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century philosophers, when the split between analytical and continental philosophy began, Thomas-Fogiel finds both traditions followed the same path-the road of reference-which ultimately led to self-contradiction. This phenomenon, whether valorized or condemned, has been understood as the death of philosophy. Tracing this pattern from Quine to Rorty, from Heidegger to Levinas and Habermas, Thomas-Fogiel reveals the self-contradiction at the core of their claims while also carving an alternative path through self-reference. Trained under the French philosopher Bernard Bourgeois, she remakes philosophy in exciting new ways for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: Doctrines that variously express one of the three characteristics that I have delineated—(1) philosophy’s scientificity, (2) examination of the nature of pragmatic contradiction, and (3) the problem of the status of the philosopher’s discourse as a problem of self-reference—are legion throughout the history of philosophy. On this point, the first required trait (namely, the affirmation of philosophy as a science in the face of a devastating skepticism) is superbly embodied by the dispute between Plato and the Sophists. Similarly, many of Aristotle’s arguments could be taken up against contemporary skepticism. And again, the theme of philosophy as a<br>

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas-Fogiel begins with postphilosophical claims such as scientism, which she reveals to be self-refuting, for they subsume philosophy into the branches of the natural sciences. She discovers similar issues in Rorty's skepticism and strands of continental thought. Revisiting the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century philosophers, when the split between analytical and continental philosophy began, Thomas-Fogiel finds both traditions followed the same path-the road of reference-which ultimately led to self-contradiction. This phenomenon, whether valorized or condemned, has been understood as the death of philosophy. Tracing this pattern from Quine to Rorty, from Heidegger to Levinas and Habermas, Thomas-Fogiel reveals the self-contradiction at the core of their claims while also carving an alternative path through self-reference. Trained under the French philosopher Bernard Bourgeois, she remakes philosophy in exciting new ways for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: Vattimo's status as a left-wing faculty president paradoxically made him a target of the Red Brigades in the 1970s, causing him to flee Turin for his life. Left-wing terrorism did not deter the philosopher from his quest for social progress, however, and in the 1980s, he introduced a daring formulation called "weak thought," which stripped metaphysics, science, religion, and all other absolute systems of their authority. Vattimo then became notorious both for his renewed commitment to the core values of Christianity (he was trained as a Catholic intellectual) and for the Vatican's denunciation of his views.<br>

  Book Title: Political Responsibility-Responding to Predicaments of Power<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): VÁZQUEZ-ARROYO ANTONIO Y.<br>
  Abstract: Scholars in the humanities and social sciences have turned to ethics to theorize politics in what seems to be an increasingly depoliticized age. Yet the move toward ethics has obscured the ongoing value of political responsibility and the vibrant life it represents as an effective response to power.<br>

  1  HISTORICIZING THE ETHICAL TURN from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/vazq17484">Political Responsibility</a><br>
  Abstract: In spite of the prevalence of ethical tropes in theoretical discussions in North Atlantic scholarly circles, an explicit embrace of the ethical turn in the humanities and social sciences has not been as prominent as that afforded to other so-called turns—including the cultural, linguistic, theological, psychoanalytic, and affective turns—of the past thirty years. Indeed, in contrast with previous turns, the ethical turn displays an almost apologetic reluctance about its self-identity: uneasiness and ambiguity define the attitude of many theoretical proponents of the turn, even if its political practitioners—humanitarians and human and animal rights advocates, among others—are<br>

  2  RESPONSIBILITY IN HISTORY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/vazq17484">Political Responsibility</a><br>
  Abstract: Responsibility is now a fashionable concept in political theory, philosophy, and critical theory, and,
                  ceteris paribus, that is a good reason not to write about it. Large bodies of work exist expounding its various connotations and meanings, ranging from questions of accountability and guilt to the need to respond to alterity. And yet there is something rather elusive about the political connotations of contemporary invocations of responsibility within the context of the turn to ethics in the humanities and social sciences, an elusiveness that at first glance seems largely due to hyperindividualized, abstract, and unhistorical thematizations of responsibility. Indeed, recent<br>

  Abstract: History has always been the most glorious of all branches of knowledge in the scholarly tradition of China. It has declined markedly nowadays, however. This decline is not an isolated or unusual phenomenon; it is merely a part of the poverty of the Chinese scholarly world in modern times. Not only natural sciences, but social sciences and the humanities have not had adequate opportunities for development during the last fifty or sixty years. Even in philosophy, a subject that has the most to do with raising the intellectual level of the average educated person, research and instruction have not gone<br>

  Book Title: Why the Humanities Matter-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): ALDAMA FREDERICK LUIS<br>
  Abstract: Is there life after postmodernism? Many claim that it sounded the death knell for history, art, ideology, science, possibly all of Western philosophy, and certainly for the concept of reality itself. Responding to essential questions regarding whether the humanities can remain politically and academically relevant amid this twenty-first-century uncertainty,
         Why the Humanities Matteroffers a guided tour of the modern condition, calling upon thinkers in a variety of disciplines to affirm essential concepts such as truth, goodness, and beauty.<br>

  Abstract: I begin at the beginning: what constitutes the self? Of course, I’m not the fi rst to ask this, nor will I be the last. However, I begin with this seemingly limitless domain of inquiry—approached from so many disciplinary angles, such as history, philosophy, political science, sociology, economics, linguistics, biology, physics, chemistry—because when all is said and done, all of the chapters that make up this book wind back to the many cultural webs we spin out of our selves in the transformation of (our) nature.<br>

  Abstract: “Newspapers. I set this word down with a feeling of deep respect. Newspapers are one of the great instruments of culture through which we Europeans have become what we are.”¹ So wrote the German journalist August Ludwig von Schlözer, one of the founders of modern social science, in 1804. He had just lived through the period of the French Revolution, when the newspaper press had become a political force impossible to ignore, but there is no doubt that Schlözer meant his comment to apply as well to the prerevolutionary era, when he himself had been one of the continent’s leading<br>

  Abstract: Pondering the question of “style” in historiographical narration, Hannah Arendt notes: “The question of 
                  style is bound up with the problem of understanding which has plagued the historical sciences almost from their beginnings.”¹ What is the “style” of Arendt’s monumental Origins of Totalitarianism, the text we are primarily concerned with here? And how does its efficacy relate to the problem of understanding totalitarianism? In her response to political philosopher Eric Voegelin, one of the first reviewers of Origins, Arendt elaborates on her decision to, as it were, allocate more historiographical legitimacy to the valences of metaphorical thinking than to statistical<br>

  Book Title: The Light of Knowledge-Literacy Activism and the Politics of Writing in South India<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1990s hundreds of thousands of Tamil villagers in southern India have participated in literacy lessons, science demonstrations, and other events designed to transform them into active citizens with access to state power. These efforts to spread enlightenment among the oppressed are part of a movement known as the Arivoli Iyakkam (the Enlightenment Movement), considered to be among the most successful mass literacy movements in recent history. In
         The Light of Knowledge, Francis Cody's ethnography of the Arivoli Iyakkam highlights the paradoxes inherent in such movements that seek to emancipate people through literacy when literacy is a power-laden social practice in its own right.<br>

  Abstract: It is with the greatest pleasure that I introduce you to Frank Cody’s
                  The Light of Knowledge. In it, Cody brilliantly analyzes the work of the Arivoli Iyakkam, one of the largest literacy movements in the world, which mobilized millions across Tamil Nadu between 1990 and 2009. The Arivoli Iyakkam sought to increase the political participation and leverage of rural women and aspired to help them attain new, enlightened autonomy through literate access to science and knowledge. A range of socialist literacy movements inspired the movement, especially Paulo Freire’s “pedagogy of the oppressed.” Beginning as a volunteer-driven, nongovernmental project, such<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7v967">Artifice and Design</a><br>
  Abstract: There are many books about art, many about technology, but few about art 
                     and technology—about their affinity and the relationship of both together to human experience.¹ It is this relationship that is my topic here. I develop philosophical concepts of art, artifact, knowledge, technology, and tool, which I use to explore parallel questions about artistry in technology and technics in art. The result is a work of interdisciplinary philosophical research, with concepts and arguments drawn from evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, science studies, aesthetics, and the history, philosophy, and anthropology of art and technology.<br>

  Abstract: Technology was sold to modern societies as a wonderful engine of progress. Allied with science it would liberate people from ignorance and debilitating labor, deepen and extend democratic participation, and make the goods of high culture (music, literature, and so on) universally available. It would do all of that not by social revolution (abolishing property or social class) but by applying the science of nature to the problems of humanity. A few prominent examples from the latter-nineteenth and twentieth centuries lent credibility to the picture, including improved public health; labor-saving devices for housework and agriculture; enhanced access to high culture<br>

  Author(s) Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: The condition of German literature and its place and function in society was one of Herder’s major concerns. He thought of “literature” in an older, more comprehensive sense: It included, in addition to poetry, all types of prose writing, not only drama and fiction, but also biographies and memoirs, historiography, essays on all topics of general interest including science, and last but not least writings in the area of theology and religion, from church hymns and sermons to edifying and scholarly treatises.

  Abstract: Among the theologians of the late eighteenth century, Herder combines a unique variety of traditional elements with highly progressive and innovative components. His publications touch on most classical fields of academic education as well as the broad range of professional interests typical of the Protestant clergy. Herder expanded the frontiers of academic theology, exploring and interpreting results of contemporary debates in the humanities and sciences. Within the boundaries of a transitory period characterized by rationalist, empirical, and idealistic currents of thought, Herder investigated the various positions by addressing a wide range of fundamental questions.

  Abstract: Nation as Grand Narrative offers a methodical analysis of how relations of domination and subordination are conveyed through media narratives of nationhood. Using the typical postcolonial state of Nigeria as a template and engaging with disciplines ranging from media studies, political science, and social theory to historical sociology and hermeneutics, Wale Adebanwi examines how the nation as grand narrative provides a critical interpretive lens through which competition among ethnic, ethnoregional, and ethnoreligious groups can be analyzed. Adebanwi illustrates how meaning is connected to power through ideology in the struggles enacted on the pages of the print media over diverse issues including federalism, democracy and democratization, religion, majority-minority ethnic relations, space and territoriality, self-determination, and threat of secession. Nation as Grand Narrative will trigger further critical reflections on the articulation of relations of domination in the context of postcolonial grand narratives.

  Abstract: The inclusion of a novel by Heinrich Böll in a volume on the topic of the “good German” should come as no surprise — indeed, the author himself could have been proposed as a worthy topic for this volume, as he acquired during his lifetime a reputation as the “conscience of the nation” and representative of an alternative, better Germany. Böll’s friend, the critic Heinrich Vormweg, chose the label “der andere Deutsche” (the other German) as the title of his biography of Böll — sidestepping the notion of the “good German,” but still suggesting a particular moral quality that distinguished the author<br>

It was the brainchild of Artur Hazelius who, in 1873, had founded the Nordiska Museet in Stockholm, which exhibited examples of folklife from around the country. It was Hazelius’s desire that the Nordiska Museet be ‘of benefit to science and at the same time arouse and fuel feelings of patriotism’, as well as ‘contribute to the strengthening of national feeling generation after generation, infusing love of one’s country … among young and old’.¹ This was a nationalism not of politics,<br>

  Abstract: Suffering and death are universal. They are the basal experience that tragic art addresses. But is tragic art in one form or another also universal? Are there times and places on which tragic thinking can have no purchase? If so, is our anti-mythic age of science and reason, of democracy and rapid technological progress an era unsuited to tragic art? The modern world is largely optimistic despite the massively destructive violence of the last century. Terrible things still happen to individuals, to families, to whole peoples.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610441872">Fighting For Time</a><br>
  Author(s) Collinson Margaret<br>
  Abstract: The analytical significance of time has long been recognized in the natural science writings of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein and in the philosophical tracts of Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, among others. Indeed an awareness of a past, a present, and a future, and of the finiteness of life are central features of human existence (Berger and Luckmann 1967). Human beings find meaning and identity in the temporal character of existence (Urry 1991, Collinson 2003). Yet it is only relatively recently that the importance of time has been acknowledged in theories of society (Giddens 1979, 1984, 1987; Adam 1990; Harvey 1990;<br>

  Book Title: After Parsons-A Theory of Social Action for the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Bershady Harold J.<br>
  Abstract: Esteemed twentieth-century sociologist Talcott Parsons sought to develop a comprehensive and coherent scheme for sociology that could be applied to every society and historical epoch, and address every aspect of human social organization and culture. His theory of social action has exerted enormous influence across a wide range of social science disciplines.
         After Parsons, edited by Renée Fox, Victor Lidz, and Harold Bershady, provides a critical reexamination of Parsons' theory in light of historical changes in the world and advances in sociological thought since his death.<br>

  Author(s) Bershady Harold J.<br>
  Abstract: From the 1930s to the mid-1960s, Talcott Parsons was the leading contributor to the development of sociological theory, in the United States and internationally. More than any other contemporary figure, he shaped the conceptual schemes used in research, the bodies of theory taught to students, and thinking about the issues requiring investigation at the frontiers of sociological knowledge. In some dozen books and hundreds of essays, he elaborated an unfolding theoretical system that not only had a far-reaching, formative influence on sociological thought and research but also extended to other social sciences, including economics, political science, anthropology, psychology, and psychoanalysis.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610442152">After Parsons</a><br>
  Author(s) Alexander Jeffrey C.<br>
  Abstract: Within the strongly empiricist framework of American social science, there is very little acknowledgment of the nonempirical, theoretically driven dimension of scientific change. Yet the major developments in social science do not emerge primarily from simple accumulation of empirical knowledge or from proving previous theories false. They grow from confrontations with other, hegemonic theories. These confrontations, which are often intense and highly emotional, may take the form of critical experiments that crystallize and operationalize more general commitments, but they usually also present themselves as more general, less empirical arguments about theoretical logic itself.<br>

  Abstract: In autumn 1982, Stefan Nowak and David Featherman planned, within the broader framework of the program of cooperation in the social sciences between the Polish Academy of Sciences and the American Council of Learned Societies and with encouragement from the International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX), a series of Polish-American conferences in sociology. The general methodological theme of the conferences was intended to be the qualitative-quantitative chasm in sociology, with the aim of helping to bridge that chasm, both in theory and in research.

  Abstract: Although it may be only an aspect of what Thomas Kuhn has suggested as the developmental path of any normal science, there is a worrisome drift in the social sciences away from an involvement with overarching issues and toward further specialization and progressively more detailed problem-solving. More disturbingly, a matter-of-fact acceptance of a limited and largely one-way relationship between producers of social science and their consumers, supporters, and observers is gradually taking root. Basic disciplinary premises and priorities are assumed to be fairly static rather than subject to active questioning and reshaping. Disciplinary boundaries that are best kept indefinite and<br>

  Abstract: When James Coleman asked me to be on this panel, a panel on current issues in social theory, I asked him what he thought “issues” and “social theory” meant as a topic. He said he would be happy if we would discuss what ought to be the dominant themes and issues in sociology. “Current,” as we use the term normally in the social sciences, is a term that refers to a decade or maybe 20 years, but not much more than that. I am more interested in a period of about 150 years, one running roughly from 1800 or 1850<br>

  Author(s) BEN-DAVID JOSEPH<br>
  Abstract: Sociology of knowledge was very popular in continental European sociology during the 1920s and 1930s, went into almost complete oblivion during and after World War II, to reappear again with added force about 1970 (Curtis & Petras 1970; Fuhrman 1980; Hamilton 1974; Merton 1973; Remmling 1967; Stark 1958). This recent interest in the sociology of knowledge has been distinguished from prewar sociology of knowledge by three characteristics: (1) the field is now as popular in Britain as on the continent of Europe and has many adherents also in the United States; (2) it also claims as its domain science, a<br>

  Author(s) COLLINS RANDALL<br>
  Abstract: If we go back to the 1920s, we find philosophies of knowledge which for the most part exempted science from the realm of explanation. The first people who pushed into a sociology of science were Marxists in the 1930s: J. D. Bernal in England, Bernard Stern on this side of the Atlantic, and others who had rather strong ideological concerns about why science should not be exempt from being seen as part of a social system and hence molded to social purposes. This line of analysis largely disappeared for some time, but not without leaving a residue, and not without<br>

  Abstract: When all was said and done, there were two lingering problems that at times were posed directly, at other times were present only obliquely. One was the archeologists’ question why all the noise when nothing could be proven categorically. For them, once it was clear that a definitive conclusion could not be accepted or imposed about the remains of Skeleton No. 95, this made the whole discussion immaterial and a waste of time. After all, science deals only with proven theses. In a charitable version, this question can explain part of the implicit passivity of some among the archeologists. In<br>

It was also the high age of revolutions, of the advent of mass politics, of science, and the passionate struggle between a numbers of -isms: conservatism, liberalism, socialism, republicanism, romanticism, anarchism, and so on. No wonder that the great debate in an era that saw the shaping of several social science disciplines was about the role of individuals in history, notably heroes, versus the blind operation of structural forces and social<br>

  Abstract: The 500th anniversary of Thomas More’s Utopia has directed attention toward the importance of utopianism. Utopian Horizons investigates the possibilities of cooperation between the humanities and the social sciences in the analysis of 20th century and contemporary utopian phenomena. The papers deal with major problems of interpreting utopias, the relationship of utopia and ideology, and the highly problematic issue as to whether utopia necessarily leads to dystopia. Besides reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary utopian investigations, the papers effectively represent the constructive attitudes of utopian thought, a feature that not only defines late 20th- and 21st-century utopianism, but is one of the primary reasons behind the rising importance of the topic.<br>

Decades of research in science-and cultural history as well as in historical anthropology has made it manifest that many brilliant minds of the great generation of fifteenth and sixteenth-century humanists not only believed in astrology, alchemy, and in a host of demons and spirits surrounding them, but quite often they even engaged in sometimes<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History 131 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] By the early 1980s, some commentators inside and outside the profession were wondering whether an American history had disappeared in the onslaught of highly particular studies, often about subgroups in the larger society of the United States. These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995).

Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends.

The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: This essay brings together and builds upon histories of cold war American science and studies of objectivity, scientific personae, and the self by exploring the physicist Merle A. Tuve‘s career in the late 1940s and 1950s as a history of selfhood and the emotional dimensions of scientific identity. As director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington after World War II, Tuve followed a convoluted path through the institutions, politics, identities, and sensibilities of science in the cold war, and he struggled to preserve a sense of meaning and identity centered on the humanistic and aesthetic possibilities of scientific inquiry in an era of rapidly growing instrumentalism. His predicament highlights not just the political and institutional shifts within postwar science, but also the intricate entanglements between feeling, selfhood, and the cold war order.<br>

Abstract: Culture has been regarded as an anathema to psychology as an empiricist research tradition. Despite the explosive growth of research on culture and psychology over the last decade of the 20
         thcentury and its importance in Asian social psychology, the ontological and epistemological tension between psychology as a science and psychology as a cultural/historical discipline introduced in the writings of the thinkers of the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment still lingers on in the contemporary discourse of psychology. Clifford Geertz once ominously suggested that cultural psychology may have chewed more than it can. In this paper, the interpretive turn in social science as exemplified by writings of Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur is reviewed and discussed how it may impinge on the practice of Asian social psychology as an empirical science in methodological, epistemological, and ontological respects. It is argued here that the current practice of Asian social psychology is largely, though not entirely, free of the challenges mounted by these theorists, and that Asian social psychology has an advantage of not encumbered by this traditional tension due to a monist ontology that is prevalent in Asia.<br>

Abstract: Memoria Abierta's work responds to the need for a dialogue in Argentina among human rights organizations, the government, and civil society that will stimulate the formation of a collective memory about the history of State-led terrorism in the country. Processing documents, testimonies, and images related to the history of illegal repression in Argentina (c. 1974–1983), and creating a topographical reconstruction of the locations where State-led terrorism occurred poses diverse ethical, technical, and political problems regarding the recollection, description, transmission, and diffusion of the materials of memory. This article describes some of these challenges and how they affect and are shaped by the work of Memoria Abierta.<br>

Abstract: History, like a vast river, propels logs, vegetation, rafts, and debris; it is full of live and dead things, some destined for resurrection; it mingles many waters and holds in solution invisible substances stolen from distant soils. Anything may become part of it; that is why it can be an image of the continuity of mankind. And it is also why some of its freight turns up again in the social sciences: they were constructed out of the contents of history in the same way as houses in medieval Rome were made out of stones taken from the Coliseum. But the special sciences based on sorted facts cannot be mistaken for rivers flowing in time and full of persons and events. They are systems fashioned with concepts, numbers, and abstract relations. For history, the reward of eluding method is to escape abstraction. (Barzun 1974, 95)<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Steven D.<br>
Abstract: Methods of studying religion can be divided into those which help the investigator "understand" religion from the believer's standpoint and those which "explain" religion in the terms of the sciences. Yet despite the contemporary polemics, these methods need not be alienated from one another. Applying the hermeneutic theory of Paul Ricoeur we can see that the study of religion involves us in an act of interpretation which necessarily requires both methods of understanding and explanation. Ricoeur's theory is employed to show how these methods can be systematically used in tandem so that the most adequate interpretation of the religious world is produced.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the perception of space through both visual and haptic systems of perception and examines the resultant impact on the process of spatial visualization. The development of technology from science as magic to science as information is used as a framework to (re)discover relationships between (1) the perception of space and the tools of visualization and (2) their effects on architectural education.<br>

Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroastrian theology. Zoroastrianism proclaims a movement through time from dualism toward monotheism, i.e., a dualism which is being made false by the dynamics of time, and a monotheism which is being made true by those same dynamics of time. The meaning of the eschaton in Zoroastrianism is thus the triumph of monotheism, the good God Ahura Mazdā having at last won his way through to complete and final ascendancy. But in the meantime there is vital truth to dualism, the neglect of which can only lead to a distortion of the religion's essential teachings. We develop this interpretation in the last part of our paper and argue for its satisfaction of the four criteria.<br>

Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be grounded upon ideological conviction alone. It required both concrete guidelines for praxis and the creation of an institutional matrix to mobilize the moral forces of the society, to form public opinion. These works then as ideological matrices for the creation of collective conscience were also designed to precipitate the transformation of the Church into an agent of human emancipation. The art of the genre was also an act. But in an age noted for "writing-as-action" the exemplars of the genre laid a complexly interwoven, carefully stressed foundation for Christian involvement in social change. Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis appears at the end of this analysis as the unsurpassed formulation of this distinctive genre.<br>

Abstract: According to a school of thought that has been gaining ground for about a century, the social sciences are best conceived as styles of humanistic inquiry akin to hermeneutics rather than as branches of naturalistic inquiry paralleling the natural or physical sciences. In the past decade or so, advocates of this position have been active in providing critiques of educational research. It is argued that, although the case has some merit, the prognosis is mistaken--traditional naturalistic inquiry in education and the social sciences will continue to have an important and strong role. /// D'après une école de pensée qui gagne du terrain depuis environ un siècle, les sciences sociales devraient être considérées comme des enquêtes humanistes apparentées à l'herméneutique plutôt que comme des disciplines cherchant à comprendre la nature des choses comme le font les sciences naturelles. Au cours de la dernière décennie, les partisans de ce point de vue ont multiplié leurs critiques à l'endroit de la recherche en éducation. On affirme que, même si ce point de vue est valable à certains égards, le pronostic donné est erroné: les recherches en éducation cherchant à élucider la nature même de son objet d'étude et les sciences sociales continueront à jouer un rôle clé. /// Eine geistige Richtung, die sich seit etwa einem Jahrhundert stärker durchsetzt, sieht die Socialwissenschaften am ehesten als Arten humanistischer Untersuchung, die mit der Hermeneutik verwandt sind, denn als Zweige der naturalistischen Untersuchung, die den Natur- oder Physik-Wissenschaften gleichen. In den letzten zehn Jahren etwa waren Vertreter dieser Schule aktiv damit beschäftig, kritische Abhandlungen über erziehungswissenschaftliche Forschung vorzubringen. Es wird argumentiert, daß die gestellte Prognose falsch ist, wenngleich die Sache einen gewissen Wert hat--traditionelle naturalistiche Forschung in den Erziehungs--und Sozialwissenschaften wird weiterhin eine wichtige und starke Rolle spielen. /// De acuerdo a una corriente de pensamiento que ha estado ganando terreno durante un centenar de años, las ciencias sociales se conceben como estilos de investigación de índole humanística, similares a la hermenéutica, más bien que como ramas de una investigación naturalística paralela a las ciencias naturales o físicas. En aproximadamente la última década, los partidarios de esta posición han estado activos en preparar críticas de la investigación en educación. Se argumenta que, aunque su caso tiene algún mérito, la prognosis que dan es equivocada; la investigación tradicional de índole naturalística en educación y en ciencias sociales sequirá teniendo un papel fuerte y importante.<br>

Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the two hypotheses a model is presented, growing out of the structure of action. Three forms of uncertainty are thus identified, relating respectively to values, the state of affairs, and the means of action. These three uncertainties, seen in terms of social structure, are to be understood and examined in turn, in terms, respectively, of questions of legitimization and motivation, at the level of institutional and organizational arrangements, or with respect to strategy and "operational" systems. The first are identified in societies under a "central" capitalism, the second with socialist social organization, and the third with "peripheral" capitalism. On the basis of an analysis of political conditions which have facilitated the emergence of these specific forms of challenges, an effort is made to determine conditions which are necessary--but not sufficient--for these challenges to be dealt with.<br>

Author(s): Skinner John G.<br>
Abstract: Recent challenges to traditional approaches and purposes for studying the history of political theory have raised questions about its constitution as both a subject matter and subfield of political science. Methodological arguments advocating what is characterized as a more truly historical mode of inquiry for understanding political ideas and recovering textual meaning have become increasingly popular. The relationship of these hermeneutical claims about historicity, such as that advanced by Quentin Skinner, to the actual practice of interpretation is problematical. Such claims are more a defense of a certain norm of historical investigation than a method of interpretation, and the implications of this norm for the reconstitution of the history of political theory require careful consideration.<br>

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: In recent years a number of writers have defended and attacked various features of structural, or neo-realist theories of international politics. Few, however, have quarrelled with one of the most foundational features of neorealist theory: its assumptions about the nature of science and scientific theories. In this essay I assess the views of science underlying much neorelist theory, especially as they are articulated in the work of Kenneth Waltz. I argue not only that neorealist theories rest on assumptions about science and theory that have been questioned by postpositivist philosophers and historians of science, but also that the failure to consider the work of these writers yields theories of international politics that are deficient in several respects: they are "weak" theories in the sense that they cannot illuminate crucial features of international politics, they presuppose and sustain a narrow view of power and power relations, they reify practices and relations in the international arena and they offer little promise of producing the sort of "Copernican Revolution" for which Waltz called (or, more modestly, even a minimally satisfactory theory of international politics). In light of these shortcomings, I sketch an alternative approach to the study of international affairs, one that has been termed "prototype studies." I contend that such an approach provides scholars with a rigorous way of studying international politics, without being a theoretical science.<br>

Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Abstract: Two philosophical traditions with much in common, (classical) pragmatism and (Heidegger's) hermeneutic philosophy, are here compared with respect to their approach to the philosophy of science. Both emphasize action as a mode of interpreting experience. Both have developed important categories -- inquiry, meaning, theory, praxis, coping, historicity, life-world -- and each has offered an alternative to the more traditional philosophies of science stemming from Descartes, Hume, and Comte. Pragmatism's "abduction" works with the dual perspectives of theory (as explanation) and praxis (as culture). The hermeneutical circle depends in addition on the lifeworld as background source of ontological meaning and resource for strategies of inquiry. Thus a hermeneutical philosophy of research involves three components: lifeworld (as ontological and strategic), theory (as explanatory), and praxis (as constitutive of culture).<br>

Abstract: This article offers an anti-naturalist philosophical critique of the naturalist tendencies within qualitative concept formation as developed most prominently by Giovanni Sartori and David Collier. We begin by articulating the philosophical distinction between naturalism and anti-naturalism. Whereas naturalism assumes that the study of human life is not essentially different from the study of natural phenomena, anti-naturalism highlights the meaningful and contingent nature of social life, the situatedness of the scholar, and so the dialogical nature of social science. These two contrasting philosophical approaches inspire, in turn, different strategies of concept formation. Naturalism encourages concept formation that involves reification, essentialism, and an instrumentalist view of language. Anti-naturalism, conversely, challenges reified concepts for eliding the place of meanings, essentialist concepts for eliding the place of contingency, and linguistic instrumentalism for eliding the situatedness of the scholar and the dialogical nature of social science. Based on this philosophical framework, we subject qualitative concept formation to a philosophical critique. We show how the conceptual strategies developed by Sartori and Collier embody a reification, essentialism, and instrumentalist view of language associated with naturalism. Although Collier's work on concept formation is much more flexible and nuanced than Sartori's, it too remains attached to a discredited naturalism.<br>

devoir être formalisée ou étendue. Ce dialogue est facilité par le nombre restreint des organismes et c'est
évidemment plus difficile de le mener avec les quelque deux cents autres établissements d'enseignement
supérieur que l'agence doit auditer. Mais on peut imaginer quelques options entre lesquelles les établisse-
ments auraient à choisir. Et ceux qui souhaiteraient une évaluation encore plus spécifique pourraient être
amenés à en assumer une partie du coût.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri di altre discipline. A questo proposito si pone per Kelley il
problema dell'atteggiamento da tenere nei confronti di studiosi come Hayden White,
Dominick LaCapra, David Harlan, teorici del linguistic turn, un modo di fare storia che
si awale delle indicazioni provenienti dall'ermeneutica di Gadamer e Ricoeur, da Hei-
degger e dai suoi discepoli francesi Foucault e Derrida, e che rifiuta ogni reale possibi-
lità di giungere a una determinazione delle intenzioni dell'autore, cioè di un «significa-
to», della verità di un'opera, e del contesto entro cui Topera è stata composta. Per Kel-
ley non era possibile evitare le implicazioni che il linguistic turn poneva, tanto piú che
esso si rivelava utile soprattutto nel rivelare risorse, strutture, memorie culturali conser-
vate nel linguaggio (topoi, tropi, metafore, analogie), non soltanto dell'alta cultura ma
anche delle forme di espressione irriflessa, o popolare (anche questo secondo un'indica-
zione di Lovejoy). Se è però vero che il significato di un testo non è univoco, è altret-
tanto vero secondo Kelley che la ricerca delle intenzioni dell'autore è premessa indi-
spensabile di qualsiasi lavoro di storia intellettuale. Quanto alia questione dell'attenzio-
ne al «contesto», che i sostenitori del linguistic turn denigrano, Kelley prende atto che
non è certamente possibile giungere alia ricostruzione dell'intera rete di relazioni entro
cui un'opera si colloca. Ciò non significa pero che il testo o l'autore studiato non pos-
sano essere collocati in un «contesto», e che quindi, attraverso lo studio del linguaggio
di un'epoca, non si riesca a ricostruire le condizioni di possibilità per la nascita di
un'opera.<br>

Abstract: Beginning with Maurice Halbwachs's theory of collective memory and the great body of sociological, historical, and political-science literature on war and aggression that postdates Halbwachs, the author attempts to identify the elements of aggressor—victim memory through a detailed analysis of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In participant and third-party narratives of the genocide, it is possible to observe a commemorative quality in the campaign of mass murder. The author suggests that the persistence of post-traumatic culture and the failure of dialogue can lead people to kill in remembrance of earlier aggression: in such cases, "acting out" substitutes for "working through," with horrifying consequences.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; HIRSELAND, SCHNEIDER & VIEHÖVER) that continues the thread with additional articles on theory and methodology, mostly in the field of (German) Foucauldian discourse analysis. This handbook presents a collection of articles by the most influential researchers in this field and it can be regarded as representing the state-of-the-art in the German field of discourse analysis. Next, a selection of several articles related to discourse theory from an interdisciplinary conference is reviewed. The content of these papers is mainly the social theory of discourse, not discourse analytic methodology. Following this, a new and clearly written French dictionary, edited by CHARAUDEAU and MAINGUENEAU, is reviewed. It is not only the first dictionary of the French vocabulary (mainly) of FDA, but also very useful for German social research on discourse. Finally, the latest release in this field is a new and very instructive introduction to the field of social research on discourse from KELLER. This book will be very useful not only for beginners—it contains a systematic overview of the research field and discusses strategies for further discourse-analytic research.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Abstract: In sociohistorical inquiry, no epistemology prevails as a widely accepted account of knowledge. Positivism yet retains its defenders. As alternatives, both structuralist and hermeneutic challenges to science are undermined as foundations of knowledge by their own accounts, yielding the postmodern loss of certitude. Conventionalism, rationalism, and realism have been proposed as "local epistemologies" under the new conditions, and on a broader level, pragmatic and transcendental theories of communication substitute for epistemology classically conceived. As yet, these contending developments do not resolve the crisis of sociohistorical knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Interpretation is central to the social scientist's process of analysis, regardless of whether that analysis relies on quantitative or qualitative data. This essay presents a "reconstructed logic" of the interpretation process involved in quantitative data analysis. Drawing upon a broad literature on interpretation, the paper shows how the interpretive processes for quantitative "data" has significant similarities to interpretation in other settings. For example, both qualitative textual analysis and quantitative statistical analysis rely upon contextual and topological paradigms, although the specific conventions differ in many respects. The process of play employed by musicians and actors in developing an interpretation of a piece of music or a dramatic role suggests ways in which the quantitative analyst might let data perform to help in arriving at appropriate interpretations of statistical results. The lines between quantitative and qualitative social science are less clear than often presumed. Both types of analysis involve extensive interpretation, and tools of interpretation that have many fundamental similarities.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Author(s): Somers Margaret R.<br>
Abstract: The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the "political culture concept" in the social sciences. Surprisingly, Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number 2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining resources for re-establishing communication when the hermeneutic circle breaks down in a moment of misunderstanding.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has initiated a new direction in the field of hermeneutics by applying the phenomenological method to the interpretation of texts. By this he has effected a transition from description to hermeneutic phenomenology. In order to explicate his position the paper deals with this transformation: In developing hermeneutics Ricoeur tends to eliminate Husserl's transcendental idealism, to retain some central phenomenological motifs, and to add new elements. These elements were eclectically picked up by him from analytic and linguistic philosophy and from the current linguistic and structural theories. Since the deepest and most genuine roots of Ricoeur's thought lie in the phenomenology of Husserl, the paper concentrates on the explication of his phenomenological presuppositions and attempts to show how they were reformulated within the new science of interpretation. Thus, the first part of the paper is mainly an exposition of the transition from phenomenology to hermeneutics. The second part points to some difficulties inherent in such a move. The paper ends with a discussion of the problem of "the hermeneutic circle", which is an immanent part of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: IN THIS ESSAY I EXPLORE THE WAYS IN WHICH OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY functions as a moral norm in evangelical ethics, with the potential of constraining and even endangering the multifaceted nature of Christian morality. I consider two particular sources of moral authority in evangelicalism: the Bible and leaders. I discuss the reasons and ways in which obedience to these two sources of moral authority functions in evangelical ethics and provide an ethical critique to these two moral norms and ethical practices. My primary aim is to expand an understanding of Christian morality that takes seriously the narrative dimensions of Christian ethics, conscience formation, moral agency, and skills in moral discernment.<br>

Abstract: Religious tolerance is a sociopolitical necessity. Social and political pressures alone cannot be expected to nurture a genuine attitude of religious tolerance; in the West, secular and religious documents rely on the concept of conscience for this nurture. In this essay I ask what claims people make on each other as they attempt to live in accordance with what they believe to be true and good. To answer this question, I examine the Pauline concept of conscience and argue that Paul interpreted conscience through an ethic and theology of accommodation.<br>

Abstract: The Anglo-American discipline of International Relations defends its main principles and resists with an almost religious fervor any change to them, although the explanation of world affairs has been eluding it since its inception. The article attempts to draw up possibly the first historiography of the IR scholarship about religion in world affairs since the 90s, showing the heightened interest in the subject from most other social sciences and humanities. The article proposes the use of the term 'International Political Theology' to bridge the multiple literatures as well as to underscore the theological commitment of the IR discipline to its basic creeds and dogmas.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: The mobile and other new communication technologies such as the Internet are having unprecedented effects on society and culture worldwide. While some of the claims for these new communication technologies are wildly exaggerated, there is little doubt that they are changing our world significantly. This paper addresses some of the theoretical issues associated with the new communication technology and assesses their impact for the Philippines. Just as Durkheim and other early theorists responded to the changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, one may expect a similar theoretical renewal to address contemporary transformations. The social sciences, in particular Sociology, will have to reconsider its basic paradigms to accommodate these transformations.<br>

Abstract: Language and judicial activities are both signs of the existence of a society. There is, therefore, good reason for a dialogue between the science of language and the science of law. This article applies a linguistic theory of the Paris School (semiotics) to the examination of a legal text, namely a contract. The author points to some elements shared by legal and other texts, and demonstrates how a semiotic interpretation can provide interesting and unexpected insights into the deeper levels of a legal text. He concludes that a similar approach could fruitfully be used with other types of legal text.<br>

Abstract: The paper offers a new model of genre. The model employs Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of plane of immanence, chaos, and, in particular, concepts and approaches of cognitive science. Genre in general and the film genre in particular are modelled as a multidimensional space with a network of vector sequences, as a plane of immanence with individual works in the role of concepts, as a cluster category without a centre. That genre model provides more explanatory power than the recent semantic-syntactical one.<br>

Abstract: The article uses a reading of Eliot's Middlemarch and a discussion of Levinas and Heidegger to challenge two aspects of the approach to literary texts proposed by Toril Moi. I suggest that we needn't assume that the inner lives of others are inaccessible in the way Moi (following Stanley Cavell) does, nor that literature has a privileged role in helping us come to terms with this alterity. Literature is one practice amongst others with which relations with other people are negotiated more or less honestly. I argue that recent developments in phenomenology and cognitive science, in particular the focus on enactive and participatory models of being in the world, can help to make more concrete Heidegger's concept of being-with (Mitsein) and Levinas' concept of proximité. Heidegger and Levinas' can then take their place in a counter tradition of 20th-century thinkers who engage with human togetherness rather than declare it to be impossible. The question Heidegger and Levinas' raise about the ethical challenge of human togetherness is not, however, answered by more recent research. It is by turning back to Middlemarch and viewing it in the context of its original marketing that we can see one way that this challenge may be confronted in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: Having defined how 'secular' is to be understood in this context, this essay explores two sets of observations. The first concerns the relationship between religion and literature as cultural products of a specific cultural imaginary. Both are fundamentally associated with narrative, which, as even contemporary neuroscience demonstrates, continually attempts to make sense of the world. Both are narratives in which there is a reflection upon, and a performance of, creativity. Since the cultural imaginary has been shaped historically by the religious, then all reflections upon creating are coloured by the sacred. The second set of observations issues from the first and concerns the relationship between authorial standpoint and literary creation. The essay examines authorial intention, the nature of language and the operation of the imagination as each relates to the cultural imaginary and the act of 'making believe'. The two sets of observations and their examination demonstrate the ways in which literature continually resists secularity.<br>

Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Wodak Ruth<br>
Abstract: This article discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches in the humanities and social sciences which strive to analyse and understand, interpret and explain texts and discourses in systematic, qualitative ways. After reviewing some of the salient theories in the social sciences (such as objective hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics), I argue that critical discourse studies require a 'trichotomy' consisting of explanation, interpretation and critique. Other approaches such as Ricoeur's 'hermeneutic arc' seem to neglect important structural and material dimensions of context as well as critical self-reflection. Moreover, I argue that much intuitive and non-transparent speculation in Hermeneutics might be transcended if more historical, cultural, linguistic and philological knowledges would be systematically and explicitly integrated into the analysis of text and discourse, in a retroductable manner. The latter possibility is illustrated by applying an interdisciplinary framework to some brief examples (e.g. intercultural and historical translation studies; the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies).<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>

Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Desclée de Brouwer, 2003, pour qui le souci de l'institution d'un monde commun est lié à la
créativité humaine plus qu'à un processus d'objectivation. Il s'appuie explicitement (bien que
Merleau-Ponty ne soit pas directement évoqué) sur le point de vue de la phénoménologie et sur
les outils qu'elle nous fournit pour penser la perpétuation du monde commun comme culture
vivante, ensemble de valeurs partagées dans la durée autant que dans l'espace.<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion sur l'homoparentalité comme révélateur des changements de la parenté en
général, et ouvrant vers la question de la pluriparentalité dans le droit contemporain de la
famille, est entamée depuis de longues années. On peut se reporter en particulier à la conclu-
sion de mon article « Pacs, sexualité et différence des sexes », Esprit, octobre 1999, qui mettait
en cause la logique « identitariste » (opposant deux grandes classes substantielles d'individus,
les homosexuels versus les hétérosexuels) au profit d'une approche « relationnelle » de l'égalité
(impliquant de transformer le droit commun de la famille dans un sens pluraliste en instituant
le couple de même sexe et non pas seulement le couple de sexe opposé).<br>

Abstract: Pour bénéficier du label « intérêt général » (et donc des aides subséquentes), une publica-
tion doit avoir un rythme quotidien ou hebdomadaire et ne pas s'adresser à un lectorat spécia-
lisé. À regarder la liste des hebdos et celle des mensuels, on s'interrogera sur cette discrimina-
tion « périodique »!<br>

Abstract: C'est Descartes lui-même qui recommande ce procédé : « Mais, puisque Votre Altesse
remarque qu'il est plus facile d'attribuer de la matière et de l'extension à l'âme, que de lui attri-
buer la capacité de mouvoir un corps et d'en être mue, sans avoir de matière, je la supplie de
vouloir librement attribuer cette matière et cette extension à l'âme; car cela n'est autre chose
que la concevoir unie au corps » (Lettre à Elisabeth du 28 juin 1643, dans Œuvres philoso-
phiques, op. cit., t. Ill, p. 47).<br>

Abstract: The article discusses the theoretical and methodological considerations as well as the practical application of two incarnations of the rhetorical turn in socio-cultural anthropology. Rhetorical turn is understood as a linguistie and constructivist turn, which marks a substantial part of contemporary thinking in the social sciences and humanities. Reflection about the relation between anthropology and rhetoric shows that the rhetorical turn is oriented on analyzing the rhetoric of anthropological texts, in their persuasive and figurative dimension. On the other hand, rhetorical turn refers to the research perspective in anthropology which is focused on the interpretation of society and culture in which an important role is played by the tools and concepts of rhetoric. Článek je věnován teoretickým a metodologickým úvahám, stejně jako praktické aplikaci dvou aspektů rétorického obratu v sociokulturní antropologii. Spojení „rétorický obrat” je zde použito pro lingvistický a konstruktivistický obrat, který významnou měrou poznamenal současný stav společenských a humanitních věd. Zaměříme-li se na vztah antropologie a rétoriky, zjistíme, že rétorický obrat s sebou přinesl úvahy o rétorice antropologických textů, o jejich přesvědčovacím a obrazném rozměru. Na druhé straně se rétorický obrat vztahuje k výzkumné perspektivě v antropologii, soustředěné na interpretaci společnosti a kultury, v níž hrají významnou roli nástroje a koncepty rétoriky.<br>

Abstract: Before any significant attempt is made to read Negro-African history, the first task is to conquer its field of research. The critical works of Frobenius, Westermann and Bauman, Delafosse, Homburger, Murdock, Leakey and Cheikh Anta Diop provide us with appropriate means of investigation (which still require to be refined) in order to obtain a profound, inner knowledge of the Negro-African social tradition. Prehistory must become a major science in the teaching profession — especially in Africa — because it offers man a general outline of the first consequences of his past before the appearance of writing. No Africanist or African historian can allow himself to by-pass this branch of study. The same applies to Egyptology and to African linguistics, sociology and ethnology. Diop has used the last three sciences to retrace the migrations of African peoples, to establish their cultural unity and to rediscover the continuity of Negro-African history. The study of African, Greco-Roman, Arab and European documents (whether oral or written, archaeological, linguistic or sociological) gives us information concerning the appearance of homo faber in Africa about 5,500,000 years ago, the Egypto-Nubian civilizations, the African Neolithic worlds, pre-colonial Africa, the Arab invasions, the slave-trade, colonization and the present-day national liberation struggles and the formation of new States. The African cultural world has its roots in the Tertiary Period and it is beyond doubt that the biological substratum of humanity is Negro or Negroïd (C.A. Diop and the discovery of Asselar Man by the Augiéras-Draper Saharan expedition in December 1927), that Negroes were in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic periods and helped in the formation of today's Europoïd races. The author uses the social structures of the Pharaonic Ancient Empire (2778 - 2423 B. C.) as models to describe the history of Negro-African societies in their ensemble and contrasts the former with those of West European societies (especially that of Greece with the founding of the « city » from about 1200 B.C.) where Man was not essentially identifield with Nature.<br>

Abstract: Genocide is a political catastrophe. Yet it has not received much academic attention. A few social scientists have studied it. Philosophers have largely ignored it. There is a large literature on the Holocaust, but there is little agreement as to how this should be related to other genocides. Some have argued that the Holocaust represented a crisis of Western culture, but that Western culture has not responded adequately for the lack of the appropriate self-understanding. This crisis has been attributed to the predominance of scientistic models of rationality in our culture. Social-scientific approaches to genocide have been criticised because of their commitment to logical empiricism, which is held to be epistemologically and ethically inadequate. Ethical approaches based on liberal humanism have been criticised by post-Nietzschean philosophers for their attachment to allegedly outworn metaphysical assumptions. However, the deconstruction of social science and liberal ethics leads in the direction of relativism and nihilism, which are either useless or dangerous in the face of evils such as genocide. The arguments against conventional social science and ethics are examined, and a counter-critique made of post-modern philosophy in order to clear the ground for constructive thinking about genocide.<br>

Abstract: Jan Edward Garrett meint, daß es bei Gadamer zwei verschiedene Begriffe der Horizont-
verschmelzung gäbe, d. h. eine schweigende Horizontverschmelzung und eine explizite und ab-
sichtliche, die der ersteren folge. Die Horizontverschmelzung ist aber in Wirklichkeit ein Phäno-
men nach der Entstehung des historischen Bewußtseins, während die Vermittlung der Vergangen-
heit mit der Gegenwart ein allgemeines Phänomen darstellt, das immer geschieht, obwohl die Ho-
rizontverschmelzung eine spezifische Form der Vermittlung ist. Garrett verwechselt die Hori-
zontverschmelzung mit der Vermittlung überhaupt. Die „schweigende Horizontverschmelzung"
ist ein attributiver Widerspruch, weil die Horizontverschmelzung eine mit dem historischen Be-
wußtsein vollzogene, absichtliche und „kontrollierte" (312) Vermittlung ist. Die Vermittlung
überhaupt beginnt vom Anfang des Verstehens an, während die Horizontverschmelzung erst an
seinem Ende stattfindet. Vgl. J. E. Garrett: Hans-Georg Gadamer on „Fusion of Horizons".

Abstract: Public administration is inherently an interdisciplinary field, prominently incorporating theory and methods from economics, political science, and sociology. Less obviously, however, MPA curricula include historical treatments of particular policy arenas, institutions, the administrative state, and the professions of policy analyst and public management. In addition, the case method that figures prominently in MPA pedagogy and the research MPA students perform depend on doing history. Yet, history as a scholarly endeavor is rarely included in basic courses, much less instruction in research methods. This essay explores the use of history in MPA curricula and how MPA students might acquire a deeper appreciation of history and how historians ply their craft.<br>

Abstract: Encroachments of contemporary social theory on the field of theology are the focal point of this essay. In postmodernity, theology facilitates connections with social theory. In the domain of theology, sociocultural problems are being presented as theological issues. Secularized variants of world theology meet with theologizing postsecular social theory above and beyond sociology. This is facilitated by the constant discourse of ambiguity. In this discourse, "the theological" is a vehicle of indeterminate meanings. Praxis' oriented discourse uses the term "social theory" with its modernist connotative envelope of science and rationality, but with no obligation whatsoever to maintain objectivity of cognition. Sociology doesn't interfere with theological discourse, but may analyze it, leaving the otherworldly outside its perspective on sociocultural phenomena. The sociotheological discourse of ambiguity, however, opposes both religion and the rationality of science.<br>

Abstract: Philosophy lacks criteria to evaluate its philosophical theories. To fill this gap, this essay introduces nine criteria to compare worldviews, classified in three broad categories: objective criteria (objective consistency, scientificity, scope), subjective criteria (subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality), and intersubjective criteria (intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity). The essay first defines what a worldview is and exposes the heuristic used in the quest for criteria. After describing each criterion individually, it shows what happens when each of them is violated. From the criteria, it derives assessment tests to compare and improve different worldviews. These include the is-ought, ought-act, and is-act first-order tests; the critical and dialectical second-order tests; the mixed-questions and first-second-order third-order tests; and the we-I, we-it, and it-I tests. The essay then applies these criteria and tests to a concrete example, comparing the Flying Spaghetti Monster deity with Intelligent Design. For another application, it draws more general fruitful suggestions for the dialogue between science and religion.<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Abstract: All humans by nature desire to know and humans are distinguished from the rest of creation by the miracle of knowledge. If all cultures have developed their own forms of knowledge, the spectacular success of a certain form of knowledge, science, notably in the west, has frequently led to its being exclusively attributed to the west. Yet science remains only one of many forms of knowledge and the west only one of its producers. The success of the west has tended to marginalize other forms of knowledge and other contributions to knowledge and, thus to impoverish an otherwise potentially rich and complex world knowledge landscape. It has tended to inhibit or even prevent the development of a really universal, human-knowledge project. Its very success, due essentially to its sustained application to technology, has enabled the development of a false superiority over other forms of knowledge and a real power hegemony of the west over other peoples. The future of lasting peaceful co-existence in the world may depend, in part, on the emancipation of other knowledge modes and forms. De par leur nature, tous les êtres humains éprouvent le désir de savoir, et les humains se distinguent des autres êtres de la Création par le miracle de la connaissance. Bien que toutes les cultures aient développé leurs propres formes de connaissance, le succès spectaculaire, notamment en Europe, d'une forme particulière de la connaissance, la science, a fait que cette dernière a été exclusivement attribuée à l'Occident. Pourtant, la science ne représente qu'une des nombreuses formes de la connaissance et l'Occident n'est qu'un producteur de celle-ci, parmi tant d'autres. Le succès de l'Occident a contribué à marginaliser les autres formes de connaissance et autres contributions à la connaissance, et ainsi, a fini par appauvrir le paysage international de la connaissance, qui autrement, aurait pu être extrêmement riche et diversifié. Ce succès de l'Occident a fini par inhiber, voire empêcher le développement d'un projet universel de connaissance humaine. Ce succès, dû essentiellement à l'application continue de la science à la technologie, a contribué à l'instauration d'une pseudo-supériorité de celle-ci sur les autres formes de connaissance, ainsi qu'à l'établissement d'une réelle hégémonie de l'Occident sur les autres peuples. La pérennité d'une coexistence pacifique internationale dépendra, en partie de l'émancipation des autres formes de la connaissance.<br>

Abstract: In celebration of the fortieth anniversary of CODESRIA, an institution from the Global South devoted to taking responsibility for the production of social science knowledge, this article explores what it means to pursue such a task under the threat of colonial imposition at methodological and disciplinary levels, which, the author argues, carries dangers of disciplinary decadence marked by the fetishisation of method. The author offers alternatives through what he calls 'a teleological suspension' of disciplinarity, and raises the question not only of the decolonisation of knowledge but also norms. Pour célébrer le quarantième anniversaire du CODESRIA, une institution des pays du Sud dévouée dans la production de connaissances en sciences sociales, cet article explore les implications de mener une telle tâche sous la menace de l'emprise coloniale à des niveaux méthodologiques et disciplinaires, qui, selon l'auteur, provoque des dangers sur la décadence disciplinaire marquée par la divination de la méthode. L'auteur propose des alternatives à travers ce qu'il appelle « une suspension téléologique » de l'interdisciplinarité, et pose la question non seulement de la décolonisation de la connaissance, mais aussi celle des normes.<br>

Abstract: Evoquant l'habitude, Ricœur constate qu'elle donne une histoire au
caractère : « une histoire dans laquelle la sédimentation tend à recouvrir et, à la
limite, à abolir l'innovation qui l'a précédée [...]. C'est cette sédimentation qui
confère au caractère la sorte de permanence dans le temps que j'interprète ici
comme recouvrement de Y ipse par l'idem ». In Soi-même comme un autre,
Paris, Seuil, 1990, p. 146.
L'ipseque Philippe Corcuff synthétise comme « la part subjective de l'identité
personnelle » (« Figures de l'individualité, de Marx aux sociologies
contemporaines », Espacestemps.net, web : http://www.espacestemps.net/
documentl390.html, 2005, non paginé) renvoie à la possibilité de n'être que
partiellement investi dans un rôle. On glisse ici du caractère à l'appartenance
pour amener cette idée d'un retrait ou d'une déprise de l'identité stabilisée
autour de symboles rigides en faveur de moments de mise en avant d'une
identité personnelle répondant à un besoin d'individualisation.<br>

Abstract: What is eco-phenomenology? This paper argues that eco-phenomenology, in which are folded both an ecological phenomenology and a phenomenological ecology, offers us a way of developing a middle ground between phenomenology and naturalism, between intentionality and causality. Our grasp of Nature is significantly altered by thinking through four strands of time's plexity — the invisibility of time, the celebration of finitude, the coordination of rhythms, and the interruption and breakdown of temporal horizons. It is also transformed by a meditation on the role of boundaries in constituting the varieties of thinghood. Eco-phenomenology takes up in a tentative and exploratory way the traditional phenomenological claim to be able to legislate for the sciences, or at least to think across the boundaries that seem to divide them. In this way, it opens up and develops an access to Nature and the natural, one which is independent both of the conceptuality of the natural sciences and of traditional metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: Environmentally we seem to be both the victims and the perpetrators of a type of bait and switch: lured into the discussion by one set of intuitions, our interests become redescribed in terms that are intellectually more respectable. Our deepest concerns with the environment are converted into foreign discourses, as we strain to make the languages of science, economics, and interest group politics express our intuitions. The circumscription of environmental philosophy within environmental ethics is one manifestation of this process of bait and switch. 'Corrosive Effects' critiques this process through a case study of acid mine drainage-water pollution resulting from mining activities. An analysis of acid mine drainage reveals the metaphysical and theological roots of many of our environmental problems.<br>

Abstract: Même si ce n'était pas l'objet de ce travail, et outre les féconds prolongements de l'anthro-
pologie historique déjà évoqués au début de cet article, il faut rappeler les fructueux échanges
empiriques que les historiens, en particulier pour le Moyen Âge, ont pu avoir depuis vingt ans avec
différents courants de l'anthropologie, qu'il s'agisse par exemple de l'anthropologie juridique dans
le cadre des débats sur la mutation de l'an mil (cf. les travaux de Dominique Barthélémy [1997,
1999]), de l'anthropologie visuelle de chercheurs comme Hans Belting (cf. Schmitt [2002];
ou Baschet [2008]), de l'anthropologie des pratiques d'écriture dans la lignée de Jack Goody
(pour une présentation synthétique de l'historiographie médiévale dans ce domaine, cf. Chastang
[2008]), de l'anthropologie économique (avec Feller, Gramain & Weber [2005]), ou encore des
réflexions de Maurice Godelier ou de Louis Dumont (mobilisés par Iogna-Prat [1998, 2006]).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Broad definitions are often used in Christian apologetics. One example: 'Everyone has a
worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: This article discusses the conduct and evaluation of interpretive research in information systems. While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies. A set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field research in information systems is proposed, along with their philosophical rationale. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by evaluating three published interpretive field studies drawn from the IS research literature. The intention of the paper is to further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding interpretive research methodology.<br>

Abstract: We respond in language to catastrophic, or traumatic, shocks to symbolic systems, for which the fall of the Tower of Babel can be seen as a mythic model. One response is an exploration of new uncertainties; another is a fearful rigidity that seeks to return to an imagined Adamic wholeness of language; another is an effort to transcend language altogether. This essay examines two contemporary responses to a perceived "fall" of language-several case studies of Oliver Sacks's and two novels by Don DeLillo-and places them in the context of the twentieth-century "linguistic turn" in the humanities and social sciences and what I call a "counterlinguistic turn" that is contemporaneous with the linguistic turn and represents developments of some of its key assumptions.<br>

Abstract: Alberto Guerreiro Ramos's intellectual trajectory is analyzed to show his permanent concern with the condition of contemporary humanity. Two moments in his trajectory are specifically addressed. In the first, under the strong influence of Christian intellectual thought, the category of human person was most important to him. In the second moment he sought to demonstrate autonomy from those earlier influences, secularized his thought, and coined the expression Parenthetical Man, which was central to his criticism of the social sciences and especially of organizational theory. From this he proposed his theory of social system delimitation. From this point of view, it is possible to affirm that Guerreiro Ramos's sociology is predominantly antropocentric, in other words, Ramos takes man as the main reference in his design of social systems.<br>

Abstract: In Science, great difficulty is sometimes experienced in giving up hypothesized structures. The inadequacies of Freudian hypotheses are highlighted, and attention is directed to Dasein-analysis, which stays close to the data. This perspective focuses attention upon the phenomenological tradition, and suggests that certain mathematical frameworks in human geography are inappropriate. The adequacy of a priori models is also questioned from a Heideggerian perspective, and more general qualitative algebras are suggested to replace the distorted functional thinking inherited from the physical sciences.<br>

Abstract: In this paper we argue that the concept and practice of responsibility is being transformed within science and engineering. It tells the story of attempts by nanotechnologists to make responsibility 'do-able' and calculable in a setting where the established language and tools of risk and risk analysis are seen as inadequate. The research is based on ethnographic participant-observation at the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) at Rice University in Texas, during the period 2003 to 2007, including the controversies and public discussions it was engaged in and the creation of the International Council on Nanotechnology (ICON). CBEN began as a project to study 'applications' of nanotechnology to environmental and biological systems, but turned immediately to the study of 'implications' to biology and environment. We argue here that the notion of 'implications' and the language of risk employed early on addressed two separate but entangled ideas: the risks that nanomaterials pose to biology and environment, and the risks that research on this area poses to the health of nanotechnology itself. Practitioners at CBEN sought ways to accept responsibility both as scientists with a duty to protect science (from the public, from de-funding, from 'backlash') and as citizens with a responsibility to protect the environment and biology through scientific research. Ultimately, the language of risk has failed, and in its place ideas about responsibility, prudence, and accountability for the future have emerged, along with new questions about the proper venues and 'modes of veridiction' by which claims about safety or responsibility might be scientifically adjudicated.<br>

Abstract: On peut noter que Jean-Francois Billeter etablit une distinction generale entre les
deux systemes de pensee, grecque et chinoise, qui recoupe, dans ses grandes lignes, celle
exposee par Jullien: "On peut apercevoir [...], me semble-t-il, une difference fondamen-
tale entre la pensee grecque et la tradition intellectuelle qui en est issue d'une part, et
l'ensemble (ou presque) de la pensee chinoise de l'autre. Notre tradition intellectuelle a
eu tendance a privilegier la conscience thetique et la conscience reflechie, qui font toutes
deux abstraction du mouvement, du changement, des transformations dans lesquels nous
sommes continuellement pris dans les faits. [...] La philosophie a par consequent eu dans
notre civilisation une vocation "theorique," contemplative. La pensee chinoise me parait
avoir ete, dans l'ensemble, beaucoup plus fidele aux donnees de lexperience commune, au
rapport spontane que nous entretenons avec nous-memes et avec les choses dans le cours
de nos activites. Elle a donne la priorite aux formes que notre vie consciente prend lorsque
nous nous mouvons, que nous agissons, etc., et a celles que la realite a pour nous dans ces
moments-la" ("Comment lire Wang Fuzhi?" 111-12).<br>

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Abstract: Debates regarding research methods in the social sciences are linked directly to assumptions about ontology, epistemology, and human nature. After reviewing a range of positions relating to these assumptions, we argue that the dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative methods is a rough and oversimplified one. Contemporary social science is dominated by commitments to research methods almost as ends in themselves, resulting in abstracted modes of empiricism based on both quantitative and qualitative methods. Qualitative research is an approach rather than a particular set of techniques, and its appropriateness derives from the nature of the social phenomena to be explored.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a reply to Matthew Feldman's identification and advocacy (in SBT/A 16) of a methodological "partition" in Beckett studies. It argues that the 'critical tribunal' set up by his article may be contested on the grounds that: the advocated paradigm for research makes a contentious journey from science to literature; it dogmatically imposes restrictions on the range of literary critical interventions deemed to be of value; it employs a 'black box' approach to its own argument.<br>

Abstract: Critical theory is presented as a general method for analyzing an organization science based on either a natural science or interpretive paradigm. This is accomplished by introducing epistemic inquiry into organization science methodology. Specifically, critical theory provides a means of examining the socio-political interplay among the researcher, the research enterprise, the practitioner, and the organization members. Such an analysis requires the examination of ideology, technology, and praxis.<br>

Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Abstract: The benefits of increasing the contribution of the social sciences in the fields of environmental and conservation science disciplines are increasingly recognized. However, integration between the social and natural sciences has been limited, in part because of the barrier caused by major philosophical differences in the perspectives between these research areas. This paper aims to contribute to more effective interdisciplinary integration by explaining some of the philosophical views underpinning social research and how these views influence research methods and outcomes. We use a project investigating the motivation of volunteers working in an adaptive co-management project to eradicate American Mink from the Cairngorms National Park in Scotland as a case study to illustrate the impact of philosophical perspectives on research. Consideration of different perspectives promoted explicit reflection of the contributing researcher’s assumptions, and the implications of his or her perspectives on the outcomes of the research. We suggest a framework to assist conservation research projects by: (1) assisting formulation of research questions; (2) focusing dialogue between managers and researchers, making underlying worldviews explicit; and (3) helping researchers and managers improve longer-term strategies by helping identify overall goals and objectives and by identifying immediate research needs.<br>

Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Abstract: This paper places the problem of child abuse in the perspective of evil. In so doing it calls into question the amoral assumptions of social science and human services. The current social science paradigm paradoxically dismisses evil as a real factor in the world, despite its concern for indisputably moral issues such as child abuse. The practical advantages of a perspective incorporating evil are several. Among them are a more realistic appreciation of the need for mechanisms of social control in preventing abuse, the role of confession and conversion, and the role of pastoral care as a support system for families.<br>

Abstract: Temporal lobe epilepsy and certain personality disorders often result in experiences described as "religious." TLE research suggests a possible neurological basis for such experiences. Immediately the question arises about the authenticity of these experiences as religious. An experience is authentic if it furthers the authentic growth of the subject, regardless of what triggered it. So pathology may occasion authentic religious experiences, even as history exemplifies. For practical purposes, the further question about God in religious experience is secondary. The exception, miraculous occurrences, should not be granted without sufficient reason. This approach dissolves all conflict between science and faith.<br>

Abstract: « Le temps présent est devenu éphémère, irréversible et insaisissable »,
dit A. Y. Gourevitch. Il est aussi homogène et orienté. L'historien sovié-
tique ajoute : « Pour la première fois, l'homme a constaté que le temps dont
il ne décelait le cours qu'à travers les événements, ne s'arrête pas, même en
l'absence d'événement. » A. Y. Gourevitch réintroduit ici une acception
métaphysique du temps, s'il entend bien par événements des phénomènes,
alors que dans le reste de sa contribution, il paraît convaincu de la maté-
rialité du temps. La preuve expérimentale de l'existence du temps hors des
phénomènes n'a pas été fournie et ne peut l'être. Les temps dans lesquels
nous vivons, sont celui de notre existence même, celui de notre société, celui
des mouvements des astres, etc. L'homme ne « constate » donc pas que le
temps ne s'arrête pas même en l'absence d'événement, ces événements lui
sont cachés par l'usage d'un temps quantitatif qui se réfère à l'un d'entre
eux exprimé par les horloges, devenu la référence unique, apparemment
« dématérialisé » par son omnipotence et occultant l'existence des autres
temps.<br>

Abstract: Recent advances in animal studies have documented the widespread use of learned, symbolic communication in the animal kingdom. Meanwhile, Mechling (1989) has argued that folklore, as shared learned traditions, also exists in non-human animals. Considering that many scholars believe humans are unique in our ability to tell stories, this schism between human and animal, the story and other folklore, has a great deal to tell us about the outlines and origins of humanity. This article seeks to integrate arguments from linguistics, archaeology, primatology, folklore, and cognitive science from evolutionary perspectives.<br>

Abstract: Dans Les Chemins du paradis, Gorz est plus précis. En fait, il n'y a pas deux niveaux (macro-
social hétéronome et individuel autonome), mais trois (les deux précédents plus un niveau micro-
social autonome). Résumons ces trois niveaux: « 1) le travail macrosocial hétéronome, organisé
à l'échelle de la société tout entière et qui assure le fonctionnement ainsi que la couverture des
besoins de base [de l'ensemble des membres de la société] ; 2) les activités microsociales, coopéra-
tives, communautaires ou associatives, auto-organisées à l'échelle locale et qui auront un caractère
facultatif et volontaire, sauf dans les cas où elles se substituent au travail macrosocial pour couvrir
des besoins de base ; 3) les activités autonomes correspondant aux projets et désir personnels des
individus, familles ou petits groupes. » (Gorz [1988], p. 125-126.)<br>

Abstract: This article investigates two questions: have literary anthropologists offered telling critiques of science; and have they proposed another, more powerful, mode of knowing? It is suggested that neither literary anthropologists, hermeneutical philosophers, nor philosophers of science have constructed arguments that compel the rejection of science. `Thick description', offered as an alternative to science, is shown to exhibit properties of gossip. Thus the article responds to both questions in the negative and, in conclusion, proposes that the literary anthropological approach amounts to a doctrine of Panglossian nihilism.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and theorize the topology of 'vision' in field ecology, a domain considerably different from laboratory work in the physical sciences, and discuss the temporal extension of data-collection practices. Data collection in this field is characterized by widely varying measurements, measurement dimensions and temporal extension of data collection. We present the ecologists' field laboratory as a perceptual machinery with a heterogeneous and heteromaterial topology as it pertains to measures, precision, replication and other material practices. Because of the complexity of ecological fieldwork, considerable co-ordination and articulation work is necessary. Here, tables, tags and labels are central tools to achieve coherence of inscriptions. We topicalize the work that digitizes measurements conducted on lizards and their habitats, and that therefore imposes signs that lend themselves to mathematical and statistical processes. It is only through these digitizing processes that lizards become visible to other (interested) ecologists, most of whom have not seen this particular animal species in person. We thereby contribute in new ways to discussions of the topography and topology of scientific vision, to the relation of measurement to practice, and to the 'adequation' of nature and mathematics.<br>

Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: We use a narrative perspective to explore the relevance of the sciences dealing with ecology for management theory and practice, presenting the issues of ecoscience from the perspective of green narrative, based on the "evolutionary epic." Adopting an interpretive sensemaking perspective on narrative, we address the narratological basis of the evolutionary epic and examine the potential for the narrative to inform a new relationship between management and the natural environment. We suggest implications for management theory and practice by examining elements of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Abstract: Avec cette ethnologie de la possession chez les Songhay l'auteur propose une anthropologie de la possession valable pour l'ensemble du monde noir. II établit un parallèle entre possession et roman folkloriste (ou blues) pour dégager cette mémoire profonde des hommes. Une analyse bibliographique critique atteste des progrès accomplis par les sciences sociales dans ce domaine. L'A. conclut que ce n'est pas seulement la vision qui déclenche la possession mais tout autant les odeurs, les sons et les rythmes. La possession lui apparaît comme un phénomène dont la fonction est d'orienter les interrogations des hommes sur leur identité personnelle d'une part et d'autre part, comme une manière d'aborder les manifestations extérieures qui les assaillent. Les différents sens sont évoqués en parallèle avec la littérature anthropologique concernant le « blues » nord-américain noir, en même temps que la dure quotidienneté actuelle. /// Con este análisis de la posesión entre los Songhaï, el autor propone una antropología de la posesión válida para el conjunto del universo cultural de las sociedades africanas. Establece un paralelo entre posesión y novela foklórica para poder desprender la memoria profunda de los hombres. Al conocimiento minucioso del terreno se superpone una investigación crítica de la bibliografía que permite comprender la progresión y los avances que las ciencias sociales han realizado en este sector. El autor llega a la conclusión que no es únicamente la visión que provoca la posesión sino, en igual medida, los olores, los sonidos y los ritmos. Presenta la posesión como un fenómeno que tiene por función orientar la interrogación de los hombres sobre su identidad personal por una parte y, por otra, como una manera de abordar las manifestaciones exteriores que les acometen. Las diferentes significaciones son evocadas en paralelo con la literatura anthropológica relativa a los « blues » norteamericanos. Al mismo tiempo, es la cotidianidad dura y concreta que es evocada en el estudio.<br>

Abstract: Over the past few years, the relationship between landscape and the body as two physical entities mutually informed through performance has been increasingly interrogated by cultural geographers. Similar issues about memory, embodiment and performativity have been raised in the social sciences, yet often obliterating the material specificities of place and landscape. This paper reconsiders the relationship between landscape and memory in terms of embodied, visual and spatial practice, rather than as a contested cultural politics of heritage and identity (as it has been generally understood in cultural geography after the so-called 'cultural turn'). Drawing on Nora's 'memory places' and on the Deleuzian notion of 'ontological past', as well as on recent writing on historical geographies of exploration and travel, the paper explores the spatial re-activation of Classical historical memory by nineteenth-century British officers and travellers to Aegean mountain peaks through their embodied and site-located practices of climbing, surveying or simply 'gazing'.<br>

Abstract: A formal claim was made in the mid-20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but concurrent debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficulty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful perspectives on the essential nature of art and the autonomy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. /// [French] Au milieu du 20e siècle, on prétendait que l'objectif de la restauration était de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner. La controverse qui s'en suivit parmi les restaurateurs et les historiens d'art suscita des différences de considération sur les rôles relatifs de la science et de l'histoire de l'art dans l'interprétation de l'intention de l'artiste. Un débat séparé mais parallèle parmi les philosophes, les critiques d'art et les critiques littéraires fut déclenché par la publication d'un article érudit intitulé "The Intentional Fallacy," qui s'opposait à cette référence aux intentions des artistes et des auteurs dans la critique artistique et littéraire. Dans ce débat particulier, la difficulté de l'évaluation et de l'application de l'intention de l'artiste provenait de l'ambiguïté même du terme "intention." L'auteur examine 11 significations différnetes de ce mot, et il pose le problème de l'intention de l'artiste dans les contextes liés au domaine de la restauration. En outre, il présente des points de vue plus recénts, tirés des sciences sociales qui associent les problèmes de l'intention de l'artiste à celui de son rôle dans l'existence continue de l'oeuvre d'art. Les ouvrages des philosophes contemporains apportent des perspectives utiles sur la nature essentielle de l'art et de l'autonomie des oeuvres vis-à-vis de leurs créateurs. L'auteur pense que l'interprétation et l'étude des intentions de l'artiste est une tâche interdisciplinaire, et que son évaluation dans les contextes de la restauration doit être limitée à la considération des caractéristiques stylistiques particulières qui démontrent l'individualité corrélative des artistes et de leurs oeuvres. /// [Spanish] A mediados del siglo 20 fue hecha una afirmación formal acerca de que el objetivo de la conservación de arte es presentar la obra para que sea vista de acuerdo a la intención del artista. La disputa sobre esta afirmación entre conservadores e historiadores del arte comprendió diferencias de perspectiva sobre los roles relativos de la ciencia y la historia del arte en la interpretación de la intención del artista. Un debate entre filósofos, criticos de arte y críticos literarios, generado en forma independiente pero concurrente con esta disputa, fue encendido por la publicación de "La Falacia Internacional," un artóculo erudito que desacredita el recurso de apelar a las intenciones de los artistas y autores en las críticas del arte y la literatura. En este debate independiente, la dificultad en la evaluación y aplicación de la intención del artista fue adjudicada a la ambigüedad del término "intención." El autor discute 11 variaciones en el significado de este término, y coloca conjuntamente las cuestiones que rodean a la intención del artista dentro de los contextos de la conservación de arte. También presenta puntos de cista mas recientes en el campo de las ciencias sociales que asocian las cuestiones relativas a la intención del artista con el rol que éste tiene en la existencia perdurable de la obra de arte. Los escritos de filósofos contemporáneos contribuyen con perspectivas útiles acerca de la naturalcza esencial del arte y la autonomía de las obras de arte respecto de sus creadores. El autor encuentra que la interpretación y aplicación de la intención del artista es una tarea interdisciplinaria, y que su evaluación en contextos de conservacíon esta limitada a consideraciones sobre caractéristicas estilísticas distintivas, que demuestran la correlativa individualidad de los artistas y sus obras.<br>

Abstract: Against the backdrop of Blades's analysis in Foucauldian terms of the failure of a particular science-technology-society reform, this review addresses four questions: (1) the problem of postmodern writing as a language of rupture; (2) the justification of science-technology-society approaches to science teaching; (3) the fruitfulness of Foucault's explanatory framework for understanding educational change; (4) the fruitfulness of Foucault's framework for education theory in general. It is argued that Foucault's notion of authors who are "founders of discursivity" can form the basis of both a productive theory of educational change and also of an educational vision in which a school strives to become a community of such founders of discursivity.<br>

Author(s): Somers Rudra<br>
Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Abstract: The paper begins with a clarification of the terms 'effective' versus 'successful' teacher and their implications. There follows a summary of the results of a study addressing the issues: a) which Careers Education and Guidance (CEG) aims in Greece are considered most important, and b) what constitutes a successful careers teacher. The study is based on the responses of careers coordinators in Greece and consultants at the Greek Pedagogical Institute. Issues concerning Information and Self-Awareness as Careers Education and Guidance aims are discussed, and an alternative approach to Information is suggested. The main emphasis is placed on the importance of the teacher as an indispensable factor for the implementation of CEG aims in particular, and educational aims in general. /// Der Artikel beginnt mit der Klärung der Begriffe "effektive" gegen "erfolgreiche" Lehrer und deren Bedeutung. Es folgt eine Zusammenfassung der Ergebnisse einer Studieüber die Themen: a) welche Ziele der Berufsberatung und -lenkung werden in Griechenland als wichtig angesehen und b) was macht einen in der Berufsberatung erfolgreichen Lehrer aus. Die. Studie basiert auf den Antworten derer, die die Berufsberatung in Griechenland koordinieren sowie der Berater im Griechischen Pädagogischen Institut. Streitfragen über Information und Selbsterkenntnis als Ziele der Berufsberatung und -lenkung werden diskutiert, und ein alternativer Ansatz zu Information vorgeschlagen. Das Hauptgewicht wird vor allem auf die Bedeutung des Lehrers als unersetzlicher Faktor für die Durchsetzung der Ziele von Berufsberatung und -lenkung im besonderen und die erzieherischen Ziele im allgemeinen gelegt. /// Le présent article commence par une clarification des termes "efficacité" et "succès" de l'enseignant et de leurs implications. On présente ensuite un résumé des résultats d'une étude portant sur les questions suivantes: a) quels sont les objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles considérés comme les plus importants en Grèce, et b) qu'est-ce qui contribue au succès d'un professeur d'enseignement professionnel. Cette étude se fonde sur les réponses des coordinateurs de l'enseignement professionnel en Grèce et des consultants à l'Institut pédagogique grec. On discute des questions concernant l'information et la conscience de soi comme objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles, et l'on suggère une nouvelle approche de l'information. L'accent majeur est mis sur l'importance de l'enseignant en tant que facteur indispensable à la réalisation des objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles en particulier, et des objectifs éducatifs en général.<br>

Abstract: The natural science model has fostered fragmentation among the human sciences, leaving them ill-equipped to address matters of public policy which demand more holistic approaches. This paper proposes a science of political ethics which could encompass factual, normative, and value materials. Ricoeur's processes of guessing, explanation, and comprehension are used to develop a theory of interpretation for the new science. The work of art is used as the metaphor for interpreting societal processes.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the professionalization of religious research in the United States and related topics. Because professional societies illumine value orientations and practices among workers in a given field, the nature of the American Catholic Sociological Society, the American Society of Christian Ethics, the Religious Research Association, and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion are briefly considered. The differential appropriation of religious research in various ecclesiastical bodies, the problem of funding religious research in the American situation, and the shift in emphasis from a pragmatic problem-solving approach focused on institutional survival to a more theoretical approach to the understanding of religious phenomena are discussed. The bifurcation between persons interested in religious research trained under theological faculties and those trained under social science faculties is noted. Likely future lines of development in theory and research are projected.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I reflect upon and attempt to understand the changing theoretical nature of post-World War II Anglo-American economic geography. In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the "cultural turn" or the "new economic geography." I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.<br>

Abstract: The field of library and information science (LIS) has built its practice and research perspective on a logico-analytic philosophy, which has generated useful, tangible technologies. Lately there is interest in nonempirical philosophies, such as hermeneutics and critical theory, to fulfill better LIS' service-oriented mission of providing "information" to user populations. One dimension of critical theory, Jürgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, can expand LIS' conception of information and supplement logico-empirical research methods and research practices. This article examines how LIS, particularly research into librarian-patron interaction and information system design, favors an empiricist view of language and, as a consequence, may be limiting its effectiveness. It proposes how the field might expand to include communicative action in fulfilling its mission and research agenda.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Author(s): Hendry Petra Munro<br>
Abstract: The author suggests that all research is narrative. Resituating all research as narrative, as opposed to characterizing narrative as one particular form of inquiry, provides a critical space for rethinking research beyond current dualisms and bifurcations that create boundaries that limit the capacity for dialogue across diverse epistemologies. The contemporary bifurcation of research as either quantitative or qualitative, or as scientific or nonscientific, has resulted in a master narrative of research which assumes incommensurability across paradigms. The author weaves 3 questions through this research: (a) What is lost when narrative and science are constructed as opposing and incommensurable modes of inquiry? (b) How might scholars reconceptualize inquiry outside a binary framework that privileges science? and (c) In what ways can resituating all narrative as inquiry open spaces for dialogue across multiple epistemologies that is the heart of democratic inquiry? The author concludes by suggesting that narrative is not a method, but rather a process of meaning making that encompasses 3 major spheres of inquiry: the scientific (physical), the symbolic (human experience) and the sacred (metaphysical).<br>

La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science approach points back to a reflexive or self-referring awareness that locates the individual in his time and place. Some other aspects may also lead us to a critical approach to history : Kant's reflective orientational model of the human community, the limits he places on authentic interpretation, Heidegger's views on authentic historicity, and Dilthey's analysis of systems of reciprocal influence seen as a framework for Ricœur's conception of singular causal imputation.<br>

Abstract: Les auteurs rappellent quelques-unes des difficultés soulevées par la notion de blasphème, ballotté entre un fonctionnement de régime juridique et comminatoire dans la tradition chrétienne et une acception de sens commun liée au précédent. Les remarques qu'ils posent n'entendent pas porter directement sur le « blasphème » (ce qu'il faudrait entendre, savoir ou penser sous ce terme), mais plutôt sur les moyens d'en parler, sur les opérations conceptuelles mises en oeuvre pour qui se propose de l'aborder du point de vue des sciences humaines et sociales. The authors underline some of the difficulties raised by blasphemy, a notion hesitating between its function in a judicial and comminatory sense, in the Christian tradition, and a common sense acceptation, linked to this. The author's remarks do not bear directly on « blasphemy » , on what is to be understood by the term, what we can know or think about it, but rather on the ways of talking about it, on the conceptual operations to be implemented by those who propose to deal with blasphemy from the point of view of the human and social sciences.<br>

Abstract: Cet article commente la parution, en 1996, d'un ouvrage édité par la Maison des sciences de l'homme sous la direction de Daniel Fabre : L'Europe entre cultures et nations. Confrontés à une prolifération des études qui se réclament aujourd'hui d'une « ethnologie de l'Europe », les auteurs (qui furent au préalable réunis en colloque à Tours en 1993) s'efforcent d'accomplir une mission limite : consolider les bornes d'un savoir labélisé en exerçant leur puissance de discernement sur les études mises en confrontation. En est-ce ou n'en est-ce pas ? Telle serait, ici, la question. This article comments the publication in 1996 of the book Europe between cultures and nations edited by Daniel Fabre. Confronted today with a proliferation of studies claiming they are concerned with "European ethnology" the authors (who met previously at the Conference in Tours in 1993) try to accomplish a mission : confirm the limits of a labelled knowledge by exerting their capacity of discrimination between the studies confronted. Dieser Artikel kommentiert das Buch Europa zwischen Kulturen und Nationen, das unter der Leitung von Daniel Fabre in 1996 veröffentlicht wurde. Konfrontiert mit der schnellen Zunahme von Studien, die sich heute auf Europäische Ethnologie berufen, versuchen die Autoren (die in 1993 an der Konferenz in Tours zusammentrafen) eine Mission zu erfüllen : die Grenzen eines labellierten Wissens zu sichern, indem sie ihr Unterscheidungsvermögen auf die verschiedenen Studien ausüben.<br>

Abstract: L'expérience professionnelle et humaine de Giovanni Falcone, le juge instructeur du plus spectaculaire procès intenté contre la mafia, nous amène à examiner les relations entre l'enquête judiciaire et l'enquête ethnographique : car c'est grâce à l'instruction du Maxiprocesso (1986) qu'aujourd'hui nous disposons d'une abondante moisson de données sur Cosa Nostra, son fonctionnement, ses règles internes et son code d'honneur. Si la reconstruction d'une vérité au moyen d'indices, dans un monde protégé par l'omertà, apparente les techniques d'investigation du juge au modèle épistémologique qui est au fondement des sciences humaines depuis le XIXe siècle, l'utilisation d'informateurs appartenant à l'univers mafieux — les repentis — est à mettre en parallèle plus directement avec les méthodes de l'ethnographie. The human and professional experience of Giovanni Falcone, the examining magistrate in the most spectacular legal operation launched against the Mafia, makes us examine the relations between the judicial and the ethnographic investigation, for it is due to the inquiries of the Maxiprocesso (1986) that we now possess an abundant source of data on the Cosa Nostra, its operation, its internal rules and its code of honour. While, in a world protected by the omertà, the re-establishment of facts by means of evidence places the investigative techniques of the judge among those of the epistemological model, basis of the human sciences since the 19th century, the use of informers — the pentiti — from the world of the Mafia, on the other hand, reflects more directly the methods of ethnography. Das berufliche und menschliche Erfahrenheit des Untersuchungsrichters Giovanni Falcone im spektakulärsten aller jemals gegen die Mafia durchgeführten Prozesse führt uns zu einer Überprüfung der Beziehungen zwischen gerichtlicher und ethnographischer Untersuchung, denn dank der Voruntersuchung im Maxiprocesso (1986) verfügen wir heute über eine umfangreiche Sammlung von Angaben über die Cosa Nostra, über ihre Arbeitsweise, ihre inneren Regeln und ihren Ehrenkodex. In einer durch die Omertà geschützten Welt gleicht die Vorgehensweise des Richters bei der Aufdeckung der Wahrheit dem epistemologischen Modell, das den Humanwissenschaften seit dem 19. Jahrhundert zugrunde liegt, während die Verwendung von Informanten aus dem Bereiche der Mafia — den Pentiti — sich eher mit den Methoden der Ethnographie vergleichen lässt.<br>

Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the expression of the immigrant experience in Le Figuier enchanté (1992), focusing on the notions of hybridity and intercultural exchange. The text is shown to constitute a form of intercultural dialogue, while also demonstrating some barriers to such dialogue, such as old-stock Québécois "obsession" with protecting French, or an overattachment to ethnicity on the part of immigrants. Micone's "surconscience linguistique" (Gauvin), is explored both through his use of language and through his consideration of linguistic politics in Quebec. The possibility of an "enchanted" hybridity is mooted, although this is shown to remain somewhat aspirational.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Abstract: Le discours de la recherche sur les enseignants et leurs savoirs est souvent tenté de détacher la connaissance du sujet connaissant, traduisant des préoccupations de fonctionnalité et de transférabilité des savoirs. À cette perspective rationaliste résiste néanmoins une mouvance de recherche qui défend une approche anthropologique du savoir enseignant, moins soucieuse de légiférer l'acte d'enseignement que de mettre au jour les formes complexes et locales de construction de l'enseignant-sujet et de ses savoirs, que ceux-ci soient inscrits dans une forme de vie, incarnés, ou dessinés réflexivement dans l'espace narratif. Ce courant phénoménologique et herméneutique, pluriel et très vivace dans le monde anglo-saxon, promeut le savoir ordinaire des enseignants, se démarquant ainsi des études attentives aux seuls savoirs ' extraordinaires' de l'expert. Traduisant un retour du sujet qui traverse les sciences sociales depuis la dernière décennie, cette tendance dans la recherche éducative à réhabiliter la subjectivité enseignante, sans pour autant la magnifier, adresse des questions importantes à notre champ de recherche sur les choix épistémologiques qui le guident. Research discourse on teachers and their knowledge has a tendency to separate knowledge from the one who knows as it is focusing on knowledge functionality and transfer. Nevertheless, one research movement is resisting to this rationalist perspective, preferring an anthropological approach of teachers' knowledge focusing on sophisticated and local forms of construction of knowledge and knowing subject rather than on teaching laws (these constructions being embodied or reflexively designed in narrative space). This multifaceted phenomenological and hermeneutic trend, observed in anglosaxon world, is promoting teachers' ordinary knowledge, when the majority of investigations focus only on expert knowledge. As it can be observed in all social sciences in this last decade, the importance of the subject - the teacher in that case - is acknowledged (not overestimated), resulting in major questions aimed at our research field about its epistemologic orientations.<br>

Abstract: La tentative de rapprochement entre littérature et éducation est en train de trouver — et pas seulement en France — de nouveaux adhérents. Cela semble signaler l'émergence d'un nouveau logos pédagogique qui essaye, peut-être, de dépasser les frontières de réflexion imposés par les sciences de l'éducation. Quelques-unes de ces tentatives, cependant, non seulement présentent certaines (et compréhensibles) limites, comme l'absence d'une « théorie de la réception » des textes fictionnels, mals elles ont aussi, dans d'autres cas, l'ambition de révolutionner le discours pédagogique à travers la littérature, où la pédagogie elle-même se transforme en projet d' « esthétisation de l'existence » . En prenant Philippe Meirieu et Jorge Larrosa comme illustrations des « limites » et de l' « ambition révolutionnaire » , respectivement, l'article cherche à montrer comment romantisme et nietzscheisme essayent de constituer un nouveau discours qui prétend, encore une fois, nous sauver de la « société administrée » . The attempt to approximate literature and education is beginning to find, not only in France, numerous supporters. This may indicate the emergence of a new pedagogical logos, which tries, little by little, to overcome the limits of thought set up by the Educational Sciences. Some of these attempts, however, not only show some (understandable) insufficiencies (such as the absence of a "reception theory" for fictional texts), but also, in other cases, the ambition of a complete revolution of the pedagogical discourse through literature (where pedagogy itself becomes a "self-stylistics" or aims at the "aesthetization of existence"). Taking Philippe Meirieu and Jorge Larrosa as respective examples of "insufficiencies" and "revolutionary ambition", the article tries to show how romanticism and Nietzscheanism can constitute a new pedagogical discourse that pretends, once again, to save us from "administerea society".<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions from both anthropology and analytic philosophy lead her to reconsider the notion of persona so as to better grasp the capacity—specifically human—to see ourselves belonging to a sex group without having ever been assigned to it. Este artículo presenta una reflexión teórica respecto a la noción de género, de sus definiciones y sus usos en ciencias sociales. Oponiéndose al enfoque dominante que concibe el género como identidad o atributo socialmente construidos de las personas, concepción que considera como esencializante y sustancializante, la autora argumenta a favor de un enfoque relacional del género concebido como modalidad de las relaciones sociales. Para ella, se basa en los trabajos de antropología comparativa e histórica que obligan a reconsiderar el dualismo del yo y del cuerpo constitutivo de la ideología individualista de la persona, y critica la hipóstasis del Yo como homúnculo constituido a partir de una absolutización de la primera persona. Al analizar el sistema sexuado de las tres personas gramaticales, sostiene que al no ser referencial, "el yo de la interlocución no tiene ni sexo, ni género". Los aportes convergentes de la antropología y de la filosofía analítica lo llevan a reconsiderar la noción de persona para pensar mejor la capacidad propiamente humana de reconocerse como de un sexo sin nunca ser asignado a él. Dieser Artikel bietet theoretische Uberlegungen über den Begriff Gender, seine Definitionen und seinen Gebrauch in den Sozialwissenschaften. Die Autorin setzt sich gegen die meist verbreitete Auffassung des Genders als sozial aufgebaute Identität oder Attribut des Einzelnen, denn sie betrachtet sie als eine essentialisierende bzw. substantialisierende Definition. Dagegen argumentiert sie für eine beziehungsmäßige Herangehensweise an das Gender, die es als eine Modalität der sozialen Beziehungen erfasst. Sie bezieht sich dabei auf vergleichenden und historischen Anthropologiearbeiten, die uns dazu zwingen, das Dualismus des Ichs und des Körpers zu überdenken, der einen Bestandteil der individualistischen Ideologie des Menschen darstellt, und kritisiert dazu die Hypostase des Ichs als Einzelnen, der auf Grund einer Absolutisierung der ersten Person geschaffen wird. Indem sie das geschlechtliche System der drei grammatikalischen Personen analysiert, behauptet die Autorin, dass auf Grund seiner Unbezüglichkeit „das Ich in der Interlokution weder Geschlecht noch Gender hat". Die Beiträge der Anthropologie und der analytischen Philosophie führen zu einer Überdenkung des Begriffs Mensch, um die rein menschliche Fähigkeit besser zu erfassen, die darin besteht, dass man sich einem Geschlecht anschließt, ohne dass es einem je zugewiesen wird.<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity of the subject taught. School history holds a special position in didactics due to the complexity of its references (scholarly production, self referencing and public use of history). Set in between passing consensual knowledge on and seeking a critical position, school history objects are still under new questioning that changes with social demands as recent debates on actual competing questions related to memory show it. Therefore school history seems to be a blend of social representations, private knowledge and proven knowledge. For fifteen years, works have enabled us to better define "historical thinking" and the specific cognitive processes that are involved in class (historical time, conceptualization, problematization, construction of explanatory schemes). Conceptualized research have allowed to explore real professional practices and model their "normal" functioning: a subject that favours passing on knowledge telling the truth about the past and being attached to using neutral documents; a subject that has difficulty to coherently link ambitious intellectual purposes (preparing active citizens for tomorrow's world) to class activities often limited to memorizing, recognizing and sorting. That is why we can see a problematic develop which is centered on the difference between intentions and practices. Connecting the notion of adherence to the rules of the "didactical contract" to the other theoretical models of human sciences developed within the research team., the work -done in a still too unfocused way -reveals some important acquired knowledge which could be taken into account in teacher training programmes. Esta nota subraya la especificidad de la disciplina enseñada. La historia escolar ocupa una posición original en el campo de las didácticas por la complejidad de sus referencias (producción sabia, autorreferencia escolar y usos públicos de la historia). Divididos entre una transmisión de conocimientos consensúales y la búsqueda de una postura crítica, los objetos de historia enseñados permanecen sometidos a interrogaciones repetidas a merced de la petición social como lo muestran los debates recientes en torno a las cuestiones relativas a las memorias vivas y competidoras. La historia enseñada aparece así como una mezcla que articula representaciones sociales, saberes privados y conocimientos validados. Desde hace unos quince años, ciertos trabajos permitieron delimitar mejor el "pensar en historia" y los procesos cognoscitivos específicos en juego en la clase (tiempo histórico, conceptualización, problematización, construcción de esquemas explicativos). Investigaciones contextualizadas han permitido explorar las prácticas profesionales efectivas y modelizar su funcionamiento "normal": una disciplina que privilegia la transmisión de saberes que dicen la realidad del pasado y apegada a la neutralidad del texto enseñado; una disciplina a la que le cuesta poner en coherencia finalidades intelectuales ambiciosas (preparar al ciudadano activo en la ciudad de mañana) y actividades en la clase a menudo limitadas a la memorización, la localización y la categorización. Por eso se ve dibujarse en los trabajos actuales, una problemática centrada en las diferencias entre las intenciones y las prácticas. Articulando la noción de sumisión a las reglas del "contrato didáctico" con los otros modelos teóricos de las SHS movilizadas en el seno de los equipos de investigación, los trabajos llevados de manera todavía demasiado dispersada dejan aparecer experiencias ¡mportantes que podrían tomarse en consideración en la formación de los docentes. Dieser Bericht unterstreicht die Besonderheit des Schulfachs Geschichte. Geschichte in der Schule hat eine originale Stellung im Feld der Didaktik wegen der Komplexität ihrer Referenzen (wissenschaftliche Schriften, Referenz für sich selbst in der Schule und öffentliche Benutzung der Geschichte). Zwischen der Verbreitung konsesueller Kenntnisse und der Suche nach einer kritischen Haltung hin-und hergerissen, sind die Lehrinhalte in Geschichte nach wie vor je nach sozialer Anfrage einer ständigen Fragestellung ausgesetzt, wie neulich die Debatten um lebhafte und entgegengesetzte Gedächtnisfragen. Die Geschichte als Schulfach erscheint also als eine Mischung zwischen sozialen Vorstellungen, privatem Wissen und bewährten Kenntnissen. Seit etwa 15 Jahren haben einige Arbeiten es ermöglicht, das „Denken in Geschichte” und die kognitiven Prozesse besser einzuschätzen, die in der Schule auf dem Spiel stehen (historische Zeit, Konzeptualisierung, Problematisierung, Bildung erklärender Schemata). Kontextualisierte Forschungsarbeiten haben es erlaubt, die tatsächlichen Berufspraktiken zu erforschen und „normalen” Betrieb zu modellieren: ein Schulfach, das die Übertragung von Kenntnissen, die die Realität der Vergangenheit beschreibt und großen Wert auf die Neutralität des unterrichteten Textes legt; ein Fach, das sich Mühe gibt, ehrgeizige intellektuelle Zwecke (den aktiven Bürger in der Stadt von morgen mit Werkzeugen bewaffnen) mit Aktivitäten in der Klasse in Kohärenz zu bringen, die sich oft auf Memorisierung, Markierung und Kategorisierung begrenzen. Auf diese Weise kann man in den heutigen Arbeiten beobachten, wie eine Problematik auftaucht, im Mittelpunkt derer die Diskrepanz zwischen Absichten und Praktiken steht. In dem man den Begriff der Unterwerfung zu den Regeln des „didaktischen Vertrags” mit den anderen theoretischen Modellen (in den Sozial-und Geschichtswissenschaften) kombiniert, die in den Forschungsteams benutzt werden, lassen die bisher auf noch zu verstreute Weise geführten Arbeiten wichtige Erwerbungen erkennen, die in der Lehrerausbildung berücksichtigt werden könnten.<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

Abstract: This paper critiques the rise of scientific approaches to central questions in the humanities, specifically questions about human nature, ethics, identity, and experience. In particular, I look at how an increasing number of philosophers are turning to evolutionary psychology and neuroscience as sources of answers to philosophical problems. This approach constitutes what I term a biological turn in the humanities. I argue that the biological turn, especially its reliance on evolutionary psychology, is best understood as an epistemology of ignorance that contributes to a climate of hostility and intolerance regarding feminist insights about gender, identity, and the body.<br>

Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues for a new religious ethical approach to fatherhood centered on children and their expanding capabilities for participation in society. Under the notion of "childism"-in analogy to feminism, womanism, humanism, and the like-it takes the perspective of the experiences and concerns of childhood as such. In contrast with a soft patriarchal argument for fatherhood that dominates much religious discourse today, it argues for a larger and more hopeful vision of fatherhood as directed toward the human social good. This requires, methodologically, a richer hermeneutical circle between religion and the social sciences. Substantively, it calls for Christian and other religious ethicists to re-imagine fatherhood as an integrated public-private responsibility that aims to cultivate children's fully human social creativity as images of their Creator.<br>

Abstract: O artigo é uma leitura do debate epistemológico sobre as condições de conhecimento na antropologia. Partindo das críticas que o próprío C. Geertz faz a seus seguidores, a autora se propõe a avaliar o potencial crítico da hermenêutica. Recupera seu questionamento acerca da oposiçâo sujeito/objeto e propõe a busca de uma objetividade negociada interpares e situada historicamente. A partir desse debate questiona-se uma ciência pura e sem implicações práticas e morais. O percurso que faz avaliando vários autores lhe permite concluir que o excesso de relativismo ou de subjetivismo transforma toda possibilidade de ciência em ficção. Para dar conta em sua etnografia dos sistemas simbólicos não lingüísticos, a autora busca um diálogo entre a teoría antropológica e as teorias nativas e afirma que é na experiência vivida em campo que está a fertilidade das perguntas e reformulações de conceitos da antropologia. This article is an attempt to interpret the epistemological debate concerning conditions of knoledge in antropology. Discussing the criticism which C. Geertz has made in regard to the work of his followers, the autor proposes to evaluate the critical potential of hermeneutics. A critique of the subject-object split opens the way for proposing a form of objectivity wich is historically located and negotiated among equals. This debate constitutes a point os departure for questioning the notion of a pure science devoid of moral and practical implications. In the course of discussing a number of authors, the conclusion may well be that excessive relativism and subjectivism transform all possibilities of science into fiction. In order to deal with nonlinguistic symbolic systems in etnography, the author sees the importance of dialogue between anthropological theory and native theory. Fertile grounds for raising questions and reformulating anthropological concepts are found in fieldword experience.<br>

Abstract: A broad conceptual framework is presented for utilizing spirituality in group psychotherapy. The author considers (a) selected concepts and theory relevant to the spiritual aspect of psychotherapy practice; (b) the change in assumptions about the person and the group they imply; (c) the mystical aspects of the listening/observing process; and (d) aspects of the new sciences compatible with spiritual principles. Using a psychospiritual paradigm, the author offers a view of group therapy that emphasizes the therapist as a contemporary mystic, the group as a sacred space, and a return to profound, timeless, nonrelativist spiritual values and goals, nonsensory infinite dimensional experience leading to deep transformation of the self, and the compatibility of contemporary scientific frameworks with spiritual principles that can form the basis of new theorizing and group interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Valentin Lebedev is a pioneer of space and earth science in Russia. He is also the first ethnographic diarist of outer space. In 1982, while "on orbit" for 211 days as a fieldworking cosmonaut, Lebedev produced a thickly descriptive account of the intimate sociality and technoculture of the Soviet space complex Salyut 7. Crafted to defamiliarize (ostranenie) a spaceworld that publics saw as flawlessly engineered and managed, the diary is an argument for the value of exospheric (exo-) surprise in human experience. But on another level, we learn that the surprise is on humans who would claim to conquer "space-as-itself"—a "zero gravity" environment of force fields both extremely inhospitable to life as we know it and also generative of life in all its expressions.<br>

Abstract: Improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have led to an "epidemic" of survival. Yet we have limited understanding about the overall ramifications of survival and quality of extended life for this growing population of young people. In this paper I consider lived experiences of longterm survival following cancer in childhood from a social science perspective. I explore young people's negotiations of narrative identity and associated processes of coming to terms with their own subjective position as young adult survivors. Discussion is based on qualitative data collected from 57 young adults in 2000. I focus on three concepts that help to discern ways in which cancer becomes enmeshed in personal identity — the Delta factor, narrative dissonance and narrative repair.<br>

Abstract: Causal explanations of social actions are central to modern as well as to classic sociology. Even in its revised form. the most influential causal theory -- the covering law theory -- has not proved particularly fruitful for the study of social action. But there are alternative and potentially more fruitful theories. This article presents Weber's methodology and critical realism as two different contributions to a generative view of causality in social science which both try to transcend the protracted controversy between a hermeneutic interpretive sociology and a positivistic causal-explanatory sociology. From the generative standpoint. causal explanations are directed not towards the production of empirical correlations between variables or towards the making of predictions on the basis of empirical laws, but towards the uncovering of causal properties and the processes whereby social actions arise out of the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions. meanings. intentions. social contexts and structures.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: L'étude est centrée sur l'épisode où le Voyageur du temps s'efforce d'arracher sa machine au Sphynx blanc, dans le roman de Wells. Le problème auquel fait face la Voyageur et sa résolution sont lus à la lumière de l'essai de Francis Bacon "Sphinx: or, Science": l'épisode est perçu comme le paradigme des transformations auxquelles l'esprit humain est soumis lorsque les circonstances obligent à employer le savoir non plus de façon contemplative mais dans la pratique. En décrivant cette modification dans la manière de penser et d'agir que Wells prête à son héros, nous accédons à une meilleure compréhension de la façon dont Wells conçoit la science dans le monde moderne et à une redéfinition du récit de Wells comme "roman scientifique."<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider qualitative modulation, the semantic movement of the phonic flow. At the segmental level of verse, phonemes are semantically completed by the lexical meanings of words. This semantic process is parallel to the semantic process of the phonemic flow, but apart from the metrical correspondence between them there is no causal connection, only similar semantic content. In addition to the semantic movement of the phonational flow and the semantic saturation of phonemes, the dynamic of the acoustic process of verse completes the phonic line of the verse, which in itself links occurrences of sonic and tonal modulation.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: In recent times, under the influence of postmodernist thought sociology has largely rejected the idea of social evolution. An exception to this trend is to be found in the work of Jürgen Habermas. Habermas's account of social evolution has received some critical attention, but in sociology wider detail of the picture is not well known. Habermas wishes to hold to the possibility that evolutionary progress can be discerned not only in the sphere of technical control, but also in the sphere of social and moral development. The paper presents Habermas's views on social evoluton within the wider context of his development of critical theory as a 'reconstructive science'. It suggests that his account has been able to resist many of the standard criticisms of evolutionary theory and that a renewal of interest in this area could provide a rich vein of new sociological knowledge.<br>

Abstract: A survey of recent books on Reader-Response, broadly defined as any literary theory that investigates the process of reading. This includes not only books by Norman Holland, Stanley Fish, and Wolfgang Iser, long regarded as central figures in the area of Reader-Response, but also discussions of the contribution to this area made by Jacques Derrida and Mikhail Bakhtin. A widespread reaction is observed against the impersonality of much literary theory and the dangers of reducing reading to a science, but alternative models that stress the therapeutic, self-enhancing, or playful elements in reading are also exposed to critical analysis.<br>

Abstract: L'article qui suit envisage quelques unes des questions que soulève aujourd'hui la notion d'identité aussi bien individuelle que collective dans le politique. En prenant appui notamment sur les réflexions d'Ernst Tugendhat dans Conscience de soi et autodétermination, je suggère que les préoccupations identitaires et les interrogations autour d'une crise de l'identité gagnent à être abordées à partir de la notion de projection et de détermination de la volonté et des actions plutôt qu'en termes de traits définitionnels statiques. Je suggère aussi que l'étude doit prendre en compte non seulement la situation dans ses dimensions individuelles et collectives mais aussi les conditions de désorientation que produit désormais l'incertitude concernant l'idée de l'humain elle-même. In this paper I consider some of the issues raised by the notion of identity in the political area to-day. Drawing upon the reflections of Ernst Tugendhat in his book Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstbestimmung, I suggest that contemporary problems of identity, individual and collective as well, and namely the idea of a postmodern crisis of political identities, are better understood when we view them in terms of projects and determination of actions. I also suggest we have to take into account not only individual and collective aspects of identity but also our inability to define our idea of what it is to be human.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that historical interpretation of the New Testament is necessary to provide information for setting the parameters of valid readings of the New Testament. Such an interpretation serves the purpose of alienation between reader and text and enables the interpreter to ask critical questions about the communicability and relevance of these texts. The nature of the New Testament necessitates historical interpretation. Current historico-critical interpretation of the New Testament is discussed and evaluated with a view to possibilities and limitations in the light of current developments in literary science, history of philosophy and historiography.<br>

Abstract: Information retrieval in the arts and humanities differs from that in the sciences because the documents required differ in many respects. Nevertheless, the Institute for Scientific Information® has successfully adapted its basic citation indexing system, first used in the "Science Citation Index"®, to its new "Arts & Humanities Citation Index™". Special adaptations of the system to meet the information needs of humanities scholars are discussed. The potential effects of the new index (and resulting data base) are seen as the promotion of interdisciplinary research, accessibility of bibliographic data for sociological and historical studies of humanities scholarship, and more objective methods for evaluating humanities journals.<br>

Abstract: Inquiry in the social sciences is based on theoretical assumptions that are not always clearly articulated in research reports. This article surveys some of the theoretical positions that underlie various qualitative research methods and discusses some of the methodological issues raised by those positions. The four themes that serve as anchor points for the discussion are contextualization, an approach to social-scientific observation that takes into account the environment in which the observational event takes place; understanding, an approach to the problem of knowledge and explanation that addresses the range of what can be learned from observation; pluralism, the proposition that not only social settings but the methods for explaining them resist reduction to a single model; and expression, the problem of conveying the results of research.<br>

Abstract: The growth of knowledge in any discipline depends on discursive practice for the assertion of claims and the assessment of claims. At times, however, that discursive practice may be ideological in nature. Ideology is here defined as being grounded in efforts at domination--the ascendance of some ideas over others. Examination of the incidence of ideology in discourse is necessarily interpretive; part of this article explores the application of hermeneutics to the analysis of discourse. A set of examples of discursive practice in library and information science (LIS), purposely selected, is examined for ideological intent. Ultimately, the aim is to demonstrate that some discourse is ideological in nature and purpose, and to point out the implications of such discursive practice for knowledge growth in LIS.<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: Studies of laboratory research in the natural sciences have shown the significance of crossexperimenter dialogue in the determination of scientific facts. Behavioral and social scientists have largely ignored that role in the construction of scientific facts. A dialogic data base differs epistemogically from strict behavioral observations because of its retroductive and dialectic character. Its symbolic nature calls for hermeneutic efforts designed to achieve and assess consensual rather than empirical validation. Its ultimate aim is social organization rather than prediction and control. In view of this distinction, experimental research of human behavior must show the integration of the empirical and dialogic bases of behavioral data so as to more accurately reflect its constructive nature.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that a common reading of Max Weber's social science and its treatment of interpretation as either insufficiently or excessively "scientific" on the model of the natural sciences is inadequate. Freed from the either/or opposition of naturalism and humanism, and read through the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Weber can be read as offering a way forward for the social sciences that embraces both the subjective orientation of social scientists and the objective aspirations of social science.<br>

Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Author(s): Young Patricia A.<br>
Abstract: The field of bioethics has been dominated by the tenets and assumptions of Western philosophical rationalistic thought. A principles and rights-based approach to discussions of moral dilemmas has sustained and reinforced a pervasive reductionism, utilitarianism, and ethnocentrism in the field. Recent explorations of casuistry and hermeneutics suggest a movement toward an expanded theoretical and conceptual framing of medical ethical problems. Increased attention to moral phenomenology and a recognition of the importance of social, cultural, and historical determinants that shape moral questioning should facilitate collaborative work between anthropologists and ethicists. In this article, I examine the philosophical orientation of U.S. bioethics and the relationship of the social sciences to the field of medical ethics. Deterrents to collaboration between anthropologists and bioethicists are explored. Finally, I review past and possible future contributions of anthropology to the field of bioethics and, more generally, to medical ethics.<br>

Abstract: Many anthropologists argue that human affairs are subjective and therefore outside the realm of empirical science. While this position is based on important observations about the process of understanding human affairs, the arguments employed do not imply that the application of empirical science to the explanation of human affairs is either impossible or inappropriate, as some critics maintain.<br>

Abstract: 'Positivism,' it seems, is a movement that cultural anthropology can do without. But what is positivism, who are these positivists, and what precisely are their sins? Notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, the image of positivism in cultural anthropology is comparatively coherent and the criticism directed at it relatively well founded. What is dubious is the conclusion to which many critics think it leads: that the methods of the natural sciences are inappropriate to the study of human culture and society.<br>

Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Abstract: To date, little is known about when and to what degree science students begin to participate in authentic scientific graphing practices. This article presents the results of a series of studies on the production, transformation, and interpretation of graphical representation from Grade 8 to professional scientific practice both in formal testing situations (inside) and in the course of field/laboratory work (outside). The results of these studies can be grouped into two major areas. First, there is a discontinuity in the graph-related practices that marks a boundary between people who engage in work that requires them to transform data into graphical representations (converted) and people who do not have such experiences (cannibals). Second, the didactic practices of high school textbooks and university lectures exhibit a marked discontinuity relative to graphing practices in scientific journals. Graphs used in didactic circumstances may be associated with students' difficulties in interpreting "real data." It appears that school teachers and university professors (missionaries) do little to put their students on trajectories of increasing participation in authentic scientific graphing practices.<br>

Abstract: Graph-related practices are central to scientific endeavors, and graphing has long been hailed as one of the core "general process skills" that set scientists apart. We use two case studies from a large study among scientists to exemplify our findings that graphing is not a context-independent skill. Rather, scientists' competencies with respect to graph interpretation are highly contextual and are a function of their familiarity with the phenomena to which the graph pertains. If graphing practices are not general but are tied to embodied understandings and familiarity with representation practices, then there are implications for teaching graphing in school mathematics and science settings.<br>

Abstract: Résumé. L'un des principaux problèmes dans la controverse entourant le recensement détaillé concernait la relation entre la science et la politique. En analysant les arguments et les hypothèses sous-jacentes de quatre interventions influentes et exemplaires faites au nom de la science, cet article rend un constat normatif de cette relation. Il nuance les idéaux protecteurs de la science que les critiques ont invoqués et avance que de telles ressources conceptuelles sont nécessaires pour protéger la science d'un empiètement politique indu. Cependant, dans leur zèle à défendre les droits de la science, les critiques en ont réclamé plus que nécessaire, ce qui a occulté la dimension de la valeur des décisions politiques et n'a pas respecté le rôle de la politique en tant que point légitime de prise de décision sur les questions de valeur. Un constat normatif adéquat de la relation entre la science et la politique dans la politique gouvernementale doit non seulement protéger la science contre la politique, mais aussi la politique contre la science.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain. Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<brLink: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerjtheophil.35.2.0093">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerjtheophil.35.2.0093</a>

Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>
