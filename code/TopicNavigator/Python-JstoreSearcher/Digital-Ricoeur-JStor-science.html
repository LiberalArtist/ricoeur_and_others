  The Jesuit Journal Brotéria (1902–2002) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: For historians of science, one of the most distinctive features of the Society of Jesus was its dedication to science and scientific education, especially when compared with other religious orders. The Jesuits’ contributions to early modern science have been studied extensively and are now widely known, lending further credence to George Sarton’s (1884–1956) dictum that “one cannot study the history of mathematics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries without coming across Jesuits at every corner.”¹ Fifty years later, in his book on the history of electricity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, John Heilbron (1934–) echoed this assertion<br>

  Abstract: The fin de siècle witnessed a turbulent confluence of literary and philosophical energies, a clash of scientific and irrational preoccupations in which William Shakespeare featured on either side. Oscar Wilde’s “Portrait of Mr W. H.” (1889) set out to endanger the distinction between science and the irrational and, in acknowledgment, the most recent

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In the last few years, religion has increasingly become a subject of dispute. Two positions seem to be the most popular. On the one hand, outspoken atheists reject religion in the name of reason and science. On the other hand, we witness an increase in scholarship sympathetic with conservative Christian movements. In this chapter, I will use the term “new atheists” to refer to the former approach, and the term “new theists” to refer to the latter approach.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter argues that moving beyond realism—to post-realism—requires moving beyond the gender-blindness of conventional accounts.¹ My argument weaves together areas of inquiry that are usually treated in isolation. Intellectual developments associated with the rise of systematic inquiry in ancient Greece—marked by the shift from rhetoric to philosophy and its foundational dichotomies of reason over affect, mind over body—comprise one area of inquiry. Another is the study of historical-political developments—the shift to centralized authority and its dichotomies of public over private, civilized over “other”—within which Western science and political theory “emerged.” A third area of<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Abstract: The founder of ʺstructural anthropologyʺ Lévi-Strauss globalizes Durkheimʹs ʺcollective mindʺ and here carries it into the heart of the city—the contemporary world of the new wilderness. Beneath the primitive-civilized dichotomy, he asserts a deep structure, a principle of psychic unity that offers a way out of the anomie caused not only by a breakdown of the social bond but by rejection of the underlying unity of mind and nature. The resultant proposition is a new science—based like that of Vico (see above, p. 4) on the reshaping of a primary ʺpoetic wisdomʺ—and a recognition of the actual<br>

  Book Title: Subjectivity-Ethnographic Investigations<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): KLEINMAN ARTHUR<br>
  Abstract: This innovative volume is an extended intellectual conversation about the ways personal lives are being undone and remade today. Examining the ethnography of the modern subject, this preeminent group of scholars probes the continuity and diversity of modes of personhood across a range of Western and non-Western societies. Contributors consider what happens to individual subjectivity when stable or imagined environments such as nations and communities are transformed or displaced by free trade economics, terrorism, and war; how new information and medical technologies reshape the relation one has to oneself; and which forms of subjectivity and life possibilities are produced against a world in pieces. The transdisciplinary conversation includes anthropologists, historians of science, psychologists, a literary critic, a philosopher, physicians, and an economist. The authors touch on how we think and write about contingency, human agency, and ethics today.<br>

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

  Abstract: We have come a long way since Bury informed us so firmly that history is a science, no more and no less. Historiography has now become so various and eclectic that it is often difficult to see it as the expression of any specific discipline; historians today seem to be united only by some common concern with the past and by a common allegiance, at least in principle, to respect for evidence, the exercise of critical intelligence, and openness of mind. They differ, on the whole amicably, about the questions they ask; and in answering these questions they draw freely<br>

  Abstract: The contemporary Western philosophical scene can be characterized in terms of divisions and interactions between approaches to philosophy which assume that their task is inextricably linked to the development of the natural sciences and approaches which often regard this assumption with considerable suspicion. Philosophers who adopt the former approach have the obvious advantage that the project of which they see themselves as a part produces more and more results which are in principle—if not in practice—publicly testable and which appear to confirm their underlying assumption that science is converging towards an already constituted reality as it is “in<br>

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

Instead, animate movement effectively enables our minds to commune so that we can subsequently share the world in speech. In this chapter on metaphysics, I wish to clarify conceptually the resources involved in sharing the world.<br>

  Book Title: God--The World's Future-Systematic Theology for a New Era<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: God—The World’s Future has been a proven and comprehensive textbook in systematic theology for over twenty years. Explicitly crafted to address our postmodern context, Peters explains the whole body of Christian historical doctrine from within a “proleptic” framework, “whereby the gospel is understood as announcing the pre-actualization of the future consummation of all things in Jesus Christ.” Peters skillfully deploys this concept not only to organize the various theological areas or loci but also to rethink doctrines in light of key postmodern challenges from ecumenism, critical historical thinking, contemporary science, and gender and sexuality issues. The Third Edition is thoroughly revised with updated chapters, additional chapters, updated annotations and bibliographies, and further elaborations in light of recent developments in method and theological reflection. This classic text opens up systematic theology in new dimensions, retrieving traditional categories and topics for a new generation of students and learners to give a fresh reading of Christian theology and articulation of the liberating message of the gospel of God’s grace for the future of the world.<br>

  Abstract: A standard narrative of American religious history has relied on the Puritan sense of a common purpose. John Winthrop’s famous “City on a Hill” speech to the Pilgrims is emblematic of this. This narrative of election and purpose has shaped the way other religions have been measured. But in doing so it has neglected the voice of religious dissenters and the significance of racial diversity within the ranks of American Christians. Likewise, social science and historical studies of immigrants and refugees tend to gloss over religious affiliation and focus mainly on adaptation or assimilation processes into American culture.

  Book Title: Bruno Latour in Pieces: An Intellectual Biography-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Custance Gloria<br>
  Abstract: Bruno Latour stirs things up. Latour began as a lover of science and technology, co-founder of actor-network theory, and philosopher of a modernity that had "never been modern." In the meantime he is regarded not just as one of the most intelligent and also popular exponents of science studies but also as a major innovator of the social sciences, an exemplary wanderer who walks the line between the sciences and the humanities. This book provides the first comprehensive overview of the Latourian oeuvre, from his early anthropological studies in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), to influential books like Laboratory Life and Science in Action, and his most recent reflections on an empirical metaphysics of "modes of existence." In the course of this enquiry it becomes clear that the basic problem to which Latour's work responds is that of social tradition, the transmission of experience and knowledge. What this empirical philosopher constantly grapples with is the complex relationship of knowledge, time, and culture.<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Author(s) Snellen Paulien<br>
  Abstract: Friedrich Nietzsche famously stated: “There are no facts, only interpretations.”¹ Perhaps this could be slightly rephrased: no facts go uninterpreted. There are simply no bare facts, at least if a fact is to be meaningful. Every fact has meaning only in relation to other facts, to context, and to the human understanding itself. In other words, at the heart of every confrontation of concept and perception is the issue of
                     hermeneutics: the art and science of interpretation.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

  Book Title: Material Feminisms-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: Harnessing the energy of provocative theories generated by recent understandings of the human body, the natural world, and the material world, Material Feminisms presents an entirely new way for feminists to conceive of the question of materiality. In lively and timely essays, an international group of feminist thinkers challenges the assumptions and norms that have previously defined studies about the body. These wide-ranging essays grapple with topics such as the material reality of race, the significance of sexual difference, the impact of disability experience, and the complex interaction between nature and culture in traumatic events such as Hurricane Katrina. By insisting on the importance of materiality, this volume breaks new ground in philosophy, feminist theory, cultural studies, science studies, and other fields where the body and nature collide.<br>

  Abstract: Reexamining Emmanuel Levinas's essays on Jewish education, Claire Elise Katz provides new insights into the importance of education and its potential to transform a democratic society, for Levinas's larger philosophical project. Katz examines Levinas's "Crisis of Humanism," which motivated his effort to describe a new ethical subject. Taking into account his multiple influences on social science and the humanities, and his various identities as a Jewish thinker, philosopher, and educator, Katz delves deeply into Levinas's works to understand the grounding of this ethical subject.<br>

  Book Title: Video Games Around the World-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): IWATANI TORU<br>
  Abstract: Video games have become a global industry, and their history spans dozens of national industries where foreign imports compete with domestic productions, legitimate industry contends with piracy, and national identity faces the global marketplace. This volume describes video game history and culture across every continent, with essays covering areas as disparate and far-flung as Argentina and Thailand, Hungary and Indonesia, Iran and Ireland. Most of the essays are written by natives of the countries they discuss, many of them game designers and founders of game companies, offering distinctively firsthand perspectives. Some of these national histories appear for the first time in English, and some for the first time in any language.Readers will learn, for example, about the rapid growth of mobile games in Africa; how a meat-packing company held the rights to import the Atari VCS 2600 into Mexico; and how the Indonesian MMORPG
      Nusantara Onlinereflects that country's cultural history and folklore. Every country or region's unique conditions provide the context that shapes its national industry; for example, the long history of computer science in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the problems of piracy in China, the PC Bangs of South Korea, or the Dutch industry's emphasis on serious games. As these essays demonstrate, local innovation and diversification thrive alongside productions and corporations with global aspirations.Africa • Arab World • Argentina • Australia • Austria • Brazil • Canada • China • Colombia • Czech Republic • Finland • France • Germany • Hong Kong • Hungary • India • Indonesia • Iran • Ireland • Italy • Japan • Mexico • The Netherlands • New Zealand • Peru • Poland • Portugal • Russia • Scandinavia • Singapore • South Korea • Spain • Switzerland • Thailand • Turkey • United Kingdom • United States of America • Uruguay • Venezuela<br>

  Book Title: Mind in Architecture-Neuroscience, Embodiment, and the Future of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D.

  Abstract: This concise introduction to social and cultural anthropology has become a modern classic, revealing the rich global variation in social life and culture. The text provides a clear overview of anthropology, focusing on central topics such as kinship, ethnicity, ritual and political systems, offering a wealth of examples that demonstrate the enormous scope of anthropology and the importance of a comparative perspective. Unlike other texts on the subject, Small Places, Large Issues incorporates the anthropology of complex modern societies. Using reviews of key monographs to illustrate his argument, Eriksen's lucid and accessible text remains an established introductory text in anthropology. This new, fourth edition is updated throughout and increases the emphasis on the interdependence of human worlds. There is a new discussion of the new influence cultural studies and natural science on anthropology. Effortless bridging the perceived gap between "classic" and "contemporary" anthropology, Small Places, Large Issues is as essential to anthropology undergraduates as ever.<br>

  Book Title: Fredrik Barth-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Garsten Christina<br>
  Abstract: Fredrik Barth is one of the towering figures of twentieth-century anthropology. This intellectual history traces the development of Barth’s ideas and explores the substance of his contributions. In an accessible style, Thomas Eriksen’s biographical study reveals the magic of ethnography to professional anthropologists and non-practitioners alike. Exploring his six decade career, it follows Barth from early ecological studies in Pakistan, to political studies in Iran, to groundbreaking fieldwork in Norway, New Guinea, Bali and Bhutan. Eriksen argues that Barth's voracious appetite for fieldwork holds the key to understanding his remarkable intellectual development and the insights it produced. The book raises many of the same questions that emerge from Barth's own work - of unity and diversity, of culture and relativism, of art and science. Thomas Eriksen is himself a major contributor to the study of anthropology, as well as a distinguished educator, and is therefore ideally placed to introduce the life and work of Fredrik Barth. This will surely be the definitive book on its subject for many years to come.<br>

  Book Title: The Trouble with Community-Anthropological Reflections on Movement, Identity and Collectivity<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: 'Community' is one of social science's longest-standing concepts. The assumption, of much social science, has been that it is in communities -- and to communities -- that human individuals, as social and cultural beings, belong. Communities are said to embody that interactive environment from which individuals' identities and senses of self derive, and in which they continue to dwell. The trouble with 'community' is that this is not necessarily so; the personal social networks of individuals' actual experience crosscut collective categories, situations and institutions. Communities can prove unviable or imprisoning; the reality of community life and identity can often be very different from the ideology and the ideal. In this provocative new book, anthropologists Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport draw on their various ethnographic experiences to reappraise the concept and the reality of 'community', in the light of globalization, religious fundamentalism, identity politics, and renascent localisms. How might anthropology better apprehend social identities which are intrinsically plural, transgressive and ironic? What has anthropology to say about the way in which civil society might hope to accommodate the on-going construction and the rightful expression of such migrant identities? Nigel Rapport and Vered Amit give their own answers to these questions before entering into dialogue to assess each other's positions. Nigel Rapport is Professor of Anthropological and Philosophical Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is author of Transcendent Individual (1997). Vered Amit is an Associate Professor at Concordia University in Montreal. She is the editor of Realizing Community (2002).<br>

  Abstract: Husserl's Missing Technologies looks at the early-twentieth-century "classical" phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, both in the light of the philosophy of science of his time, and retrospectively at his philosophy from a contemporary "postphenomenology." Of central interest are his infrequent comments upon technologies and especially scientific instruments such as the telescope and microscope. Together with his analysis of Husserl, Don Ihde ventures through the recent history of technologies of science, reading and writing, and science praxis, calling for modifications to phenomenology by converging it with pragmatism. This fruitful hybridization emphasizes human-technology interrelationships, the role of embodiment and bodily skills, and the inherent multistability of technologies. In a radical argument, Ihde contends that philosophies, in the same way that various technologies contain an ever-shortening obsolescence, ought to have contingent use-lives.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Abstract: Various nations produced popular science films during the first twenty years of cinema history. The first systematic production of films on scientific topics for a wide audience came about in England, where F. Martin Duncan’s “The UnseenWorld” series, made for the Charles Urban Company, debuted in 1903. In late 1909 and early 1910, there was a flourishing of

  Author(s) Welzer Harald<br>
  Abstract: Two decades ago, inquiry into narrative played but a minor role in scholarly deliberation; the relationship between narrative analysis and historiography was little explored; the term “narrative” had scarcely entered the vocabulary of psychological science. Today, the study of narrative concatenates throughout the humanities and the social sciences, and the problems raised by such analyses for our conception of history, along with the historical consciousness of the individual, are profound. Further, there are now many distinct and well-articulated orientations toward narrative: realist, phenomenological, psychodynamic, cognitive, textual, and rhetorical among them. Each raises different implications for our understanding of history, identity,<br>

  Abstract: This volume focuses on the conjunction of two disciplines where both the analytic promises as well as the difficulties involved in the meeting of humanist and social science approaches soon became obvious. Anthropologists and historians have come together here in order to recapture, elaborate, and criticize pre-Cultural Turn and non-Cultural Turn modes of analysing structures of experience, feeling, subjectivity and action in human societies and to highlight the still unexploited possibilities developed among others in the work of scholars such as Norbert Elias, Max Gluckman, Eric Wolf, E.P.

  Abstract: Few serious social researchers would deny the inescapability of pondering the conundrum of class—a conundrum because, while steadily contested, politically compromised, and conceptually inflated, the unsettling suspicion keeps surfacing that class involves inequality, power, culture, exploitation, accumulation, struggle and action, being in history and the making of history, being in place and the making of space, all in the same moment. Class, power, time, and space together form a huge program that has haunted social inquiry since Marx. Disciplined social science, on the other hand, has been a recurrent escape from its embrace, and understandably so, since it is<br>

  Abstract: This essay¹ concerns the paradoxes emerging in the dynamic space of hybridisation between vodou magic² and the occult science of anthroposophy. These lived imaginaries and registers of interpretation are engaged within counter-modernising environmental discourses and practices in the Dominican-Haitian borderlands. Here NGO-affiliated European anthroposophists, orientated by the work of Rudolf Steiner,³ are organising a biodynamic programme in co-operation with marginalised Dominican and Haitian borderlands peasants who live the consequences of radical deforestation. These peasants have for long been subjugated to the often violent dictates of post-colonial ruling élites, and their world of vodou spirits is itself the creation of ‘resistant<br>

Seligman at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Later she worked with R.R. Marett and obtained a Diploma in Anthropology from Oxford University. In 1914–15, she led the Jenisei Expedition to Siberia, where she became an experienced fieldworker and made important finds for the Pitt Rivers Museum. While she was the first female lecturer in anthropology at Oxford University, she was also a tragic figure without a secure academic appointment.<br>

  Book Title: Critical White Studies-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stefancic Jean<br>
  Abstract: No longer content with accepting whiteness as the norm, critical scholars have turned their attention to whiteness itself. In
      Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror, numerous thinkers, including Toni Morrison, Eric Foner, Peggy McIntosh, Andrew Hacker, Ruth Frankenberg, John Howard Griffin, David Roediger, Kathleen Heal Cleaver, Noel Ignatiev, Cherrie Moraga, and Reginald Horsman, attack such questions as:*How was whiteness invented, and why?*How has the category whiteness changed over time?*Why did some immigrant groups, such as the Irish and Jews, start out as nonwhite and later became white?*Can some individual people be both white and nonwhite at different times, and what does it mean to "pass for white"?*At what point does pride in being white cross the line into white power or white supremacy?*What can whites concerned over racial inequity or white privilege do about it?Science and pseudoscience are presented side by side to demonstrate how our views on whiteness often reflect preconception, not fact. For example, most scientists hold that race is not a valid scientific category -- genetic differences between races are insignificant compared to those within them. Yet, the "one drop" rule, whereby those with any nonwhite heritage are classified as nonwhite, persists even today. As the bell curve controversy shows, race concepts die hard, especially when power and prestige lie behind them.A sweeping portrait of the emerging field of whiteness studies,Critical White Studiespresents, for the first time, the best work from sociology, law, history, cultural studies, and literature. Delgado and Stefancic expressly offer critical white studies as the next step in critical race theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do they ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to "look behind the mirror."<br>

  Abstract: Opposition to the use of IQ testing goes back as far as testing itself. Its practitioners have been accused of misusing science to justify capitalist exploitation; allowing their obsession with classification to blind them to the huge variety of human abilities; encouraging soulless teaching; and, worst of all, inflaming racial prejudices and justifying racial inequalities. To this school of thinking,

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Abstract: In

Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

  Book Title: The Idea of Wilderness-From Prehistory to the Age of Ecology<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OELSCHLAEGER MAX<br>
  Abstract: Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, and idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the unprecedented concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to "modernism" arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America's two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.<br>

And long before the social sciences emerged, such thinkers as Thomas Hobbes and Adam Smith were modeling their treatises on the structure of political and economic society on the mechanistic paradigm, attempting to capture in human affairs what was being achieved in natural science: theoretical elegance and precision leading to predictive knowledge and causal control.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Embodiment-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nikkel David H.<br>
  Abstract: "Radical embodiment" refers to an anthropology and an epistemology fundamentally rooted in our bodies as always in correlation with our natural and social worlds. All human rationality, meaning, and value arise not only instrumentally but also substantively from this embodiment in the world. Radical embodiment reacts against Enlightenment mind-body dualism, as well as its monistic offshoots, including the physicalism that reduces everything to component matter-energy at the expense of subjectivity and meaning. It also rejects certain forms of postmodernism that reinscribe modern dualisms. David H. Nikkel develops the perspective of "radical embodiment" by examining varieties of modern and postmodern theology, and the nature and role of tradition-in terms of linguistic and non-linguistic experience, the religion and science dialogue on the nature of consciousness, and the immanent and transcendent aspects of God.<br>

  Abstract: Ever since the rise of the modern exact sciences, it has become more and more clear that the scientific mind is not bound by an exhaustive understanding of its own doings. The fact is that, while discovering the inner structure or the nexus of relations pertaining to an object, science ignores the paths that led to this structure or these relations; but these paths lie precisely at the basis of the ontological ground of the object. Husserl reflected on this legacy of the scientific revolution when he argued that “it is not always natural science that speaks when natural scientists<br>

  Abstract: Il y a certainement autant de conceptions de la phénoménologie qu’il y a de phénoménologues. Plus encore, la conception de la plupart des phénoménologues varie tout au long de leur recherche, se modifi ant aux tournants de leurs chemins de pensée. Aussi est-il impossible de donner une défi nition univoque de la phénoménologie et d’assigner au mouvement phénoménologique une quelconque unité doctrinale. En effet, comme l’a montré Claude Piché¹, depuis Lambert, le concept de phénoménologie n’a cessé d’évoluer. Au départ science de l’apparence, la phénoménologie a fini par devenir, chez Heidegger, la science de ce qui n’apparaît pas à première<br>

  Book Title: Northrop Frye-New Directions from Old<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

  Abstract: Given the nature of the genetic development of Berry’s thought, it is no surprise that Berry’s interest in science was primarily in scientific critiques of mainstream post-Enlightenment scientific methodology. While he always maintained a respect for many of the contributions of Western science, he relied especially in his own work on scientists who tested new waters and were often only tentatively accepted by the established scientific community. He considered these scientists to give credibility to the counter-Enlightenment traditions that he upheld. His overriding interest remained cultural; therefore, his questions for science were concerned with the cultural assumptions and effects of<br>

  Abstract: In Europe, social anthropology is a major social science that can now boast thousands of participants. This was not the case in the 1920s and 1930s, when the number of professional, university-trained anthropologists was limited to a few dozen individuals (Goody 1995; Kuper 1983). The subject is not taught in high schools, yet university recruitment remains robust, even in recent decades when government cutbacks threaten even some of the oldest, most established fields in the humanities and social sciences. It would seem, on the surface, that anthropology has something to offer. While the reasons individuals would choose to study anthropology<br>

  Abstract: In his essay “Loren Eiseley’s

Angyal celebrates the revered nature writer’s unconventional public stance: “As Eiseley warns his readers repeatedly, he is not a spokesman for conventional science. Instead, he is a poet-shaman, a wizard-alchemist who adopts the disguise of a changeling” (70). The roots of this unorthodox self-definition are found in the depth psychology of Carl Jung. There are two central tenets of Jung’s philosophical system that range throughout Eiseley’s writing: the importance of the collective unconscious in shaping the structures of human intelligence and the essential dualism of human culture and experience.<br>

  Book Title: Science Fiction Double Feature-The Science Fiction Film as Cult Text<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUCHOVNAY GERALD<br>
  Abstract: Critical discussion of cult cinema has often noted its tendency to straddle or ignore boundaries, to pull together different sets of conventions, narrative formulas, or character types for the almost surreal pleasure to be found in their sudden juxtapositions or narrative combination. With its own boundary-blurring nature—as both science and fiction, reality and fantasy—science fiction has played a key role in such cinematic cult formation. This volume examines that largely unexplored relationship, looking at how the sf film’s own double nature neatly matches up with a persistent double vision common to the cult film. It does so by bringing together an international array of scholars to address key questions about the intersections of sf and cult cinema: how different genre elements, directors, and stars contribute to cult formation; what role fan activities, including “con" participation, play in cult development; and how the occulted or “bad" sf cult film works. The volume pursues these questions by addressing a variety of such sf cult works, including Robot Monster (1953), Zardoz (1974), A Boy and His Dog (1975), Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989), Space Truckers (1996), Ghost in the Shell 2 (2004), and Iron Sky (2012). What these essays afford is a revealing vision of both the sf aspects of much cult film activity and the cultish aspects of the whole sf genre.<br>

  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: All scientific work starts with some simplification of basic concepts. Once these have been defined and established, we begin to pile up empirical variations. During this process, the simplifying notions are modified and, eventually, they may disappear. For example, economics assumes scarcity, and hence the need to rationalize and economize; politics presupposes the existence of struggles to maximize power; and sociology insists upon the necessity of social solidarity. Taking our cue from the etymology of socius , sociology is the science of companionship or friendship. For social science as a whole, civil society is the space in which these somewhat<br>

  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: For lack of being able to offer here a systematic comparison between Bourdieu’s sociology and the thought of Durkheim – which would require an historicalanalytic monograph capable of reconstituting the double chain, social and intellectual, of the ramifying causations that link them to each other and to their respective milieu – I would like, by way of selective soundings, to bring out four of the pillars that support their common base: namely, (1) the fierce attachment to rationalism, (2) the refusal of pure theory and the stubborn defence of the undividedness of social science, (3) the relation to the historical<br>

  Book Title: Light and Death-Figuration in Spenser, Kepler, Donne, Milton<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: In

He notes that the eighteenth century was the century of psychology, the empirical science that enables “knowing oneself.”¹ He argues that the “science of the soul” grows out of the Aristotelian-Galenic tradition of the Renaissance, evidenced by the introduction of the termpsychologiaby Protestant Scholastics in the later sixteenth century. On the one hand, the Aristotelian tradition maintains that body and soul are a unity, whereas the Galenic emphasizes the importance of anatomy for understanding physiology, on the other.<br>

Essentially at first a narrative to explain the gloriousness of the Glorious Revolution of 1688—that is, the triumph of Protestantism and parliamentarianism over Catholicism and monarchy—the narrative has been quite adaptive and has been a carrier of a tale of progress built around the desirability of commerce, money-making, science, technology, and democracy.

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

Nietzsche describes a madman who lit a lantern in the morning hours and went in search of God, like Diogenes, who claimed that the light of day was not sufficient to reveal an honest man.

  Author(s) NIELSEN HENRIK SKOV<br>
  Abstract: Social science disciplines such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, education, and so on have long had an interest in narrative as a human cognitive and discursive device for sense-making and for ordering one’s life experiences. The underlying assumption is that narratives are “
                  social productsproduced by people within the context of specific social, historical and cultural locations. They are related to the experience that people have of their lives, but they are not transparent carriers of that experience. Rather, they are interpretive devices, through which people represent themselves, both to themselves and to others” (Lawler 2002: 242; emphasis in original). These<br>

Such knowledge of another’s heart, writes Maritain, is “hidden from the angels, and open only to the priestly knowledge [la science sacerdotale] of Christ.” Maritain continues: “A Freud to-day attempts to violate [these secrets] by psychological tricks.

In chapter 3 I also suggested that romanticism is not necessarily opposed to technology.

We suspect there are others. However, it is clear that we have only begun to glimpse the fundamental biological mechanisms that enabled simplexity to emerge in life. Those are for future science to decipher. Our investigation leads to a compelling conclusion. We can understand nothing about life if we<br>

This tension betweentheoryandpracticewas also evident when the new interest in practical wisdom (phronesis), which occurred in the carnival-like scientific atmosphere of the sixteenth century, with its focus on concrete, practical life and time-bound local practices, was supplanted around 1630 by an abstract and universalistic scientific paradigm, which instead took as its point of departure theoretical understanding (episteme).<br>

Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought. The hypotheses of investigation rest on two levels of Lorand Gaspar’s writing: the epistemological dimension and the cognitive value of the poetic discourse. Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation.

  Abstract: The turn to biographical methods in social science is invigorating the relationship between policy and practice. This book shows how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the development of professionals, and promote more meaningful practitioner - service user relationships.This book uses a range of interpretive approaches to reveal the dynamics of service users' and professionals' individual experiences and life-worlds. From their research the contributors show how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the learning and development of professionals, and promote more meaningful and creative practitioner - service user relationships. The book: · reviews applications of biographical methods in both policy and practice in a range of professional contexts, from health and social care to education and employment; · explores the impact of social change in three main arenas - transformation from Eastern to Western types of society in Europe, major shifts in social and welfare principles, experiences of immigration and of new cultural diversities - on professional practice; · critically evaluates subjective and reflexive processes in interactions between researchers, practitioners and users of services; · considers the institutional arrangements and cultural contexts which support effective and sensitive interventions; · draws on actual projects and tracks reflection, progress and outcomes. With contributions from leading international experts, it provides a valuable comparative perspective. Researchers, policy analysts and practitioners, postgraduate students, teachers and trainers will find this book a stimulating read.<br>

  Abstract: While studying Vietnamese intellectuals of the colonial era, I was struck by what an extraordinarily dynamic period it was, not only in terms of art and literature (fairly well documented already) but also in the intellectual and scientific spheres. My thesis (titled “The Beginnings of Anthropology in Vietnam: A Study of First-Generation Authors”) therefore sought to answer the following question: Under which conditions and with what results did the science of anthropology enter Vietnam? It was far from self-evident that this science, still in its infancy, should be of interest to Vietnamese thinkers, considering the Institut d’Ethnologie (at the Sorbonne<br>

  NIETZSCHE NOW from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wf4chc">Nietzsche's Great Politics</a><br>

                  Human, All Too Human(1878–80),Daybreak(1881), and the first four books ofThe Gay Science(1882), Nietzsche demonstrates a favorable disposition toward democracy.¹ Writers such as William Connolly, Owen, Paul Patton, and Schrift offer upThe Wanderer and His Shadow293 (1880), titled “Ends and Means of Democracy,” as typifying Nietzsche’s allegedly prodemocratic sentiment.² There, Nietzsche explains that “democracy wants to create and guarantee as muchindependenceas possible: independence of opinion, of mode of life, and<br>

  Abstract: In the 1930 preface to the English edition of
                  Ideas I, Husserl defines phenomenology as “the science of beginnings”—that is, as the resumption of the original idea of philosophy, found in Plato, as a “universal science.”¹ The idea of philosophy for Husserl is, and will be to the end, the idea of a rigorous science, as indicated by the title of the famous 1911 article “Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft” (Philosophy as Rigorous Science).² As a “universal science” and a “rigorous science,” philosophy is radically distinct from every positive science and, as Husserl already said inThe Idea of Phenomenology<br>

  COMMITMENT AND HYBRIDITY IN COMPARATIVE THEOLOGY from:

  Author(s) Corigliano Stephanie<br>
  Abstract: The first issue to which comparative theology must respond when its methodology is questioned is choosing a topic for discussion. As religions offer such great variety of starting points for discussion, these points should not be chosen only according to the preference of the researcher or institution, if comparative theology wants to show its relevance to the Church and society. In my opinion, theology, like any other science, should try to solve problems and to respond to contemporary issues. Therefore, I see three legitimate starting points for comparative theology: problems of society, problems of theology, and problems that arise out<br>

  Abstract: Genetic epistemology, as I have argued, is not some kind of cleverly disguised genetic psychology. It is precisely what its name indicates-an epistemology oriented towards the genesis and development of knowledge. But as we have seen, it has a complex domain, including the growth of knowledge both in the individual person and in the history of science. As such, it is not merely an epistemology but also a philosophy of science. For, after all, if the philosophy of science is taken to be the epistemology of science-an assumption widely accepted-and if genetic epistemology is concerned with the epistemology of scientific<br>

  Variations across Multiple Groups in Forms of Dreaming from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sfz">The Multiplicity of Dreams</a><br>
  Abstract: In beginning an overview of dreaming we could do worse than return to the nineteenth-century dream phenomenologists—who at least knew what later laboratory researchers and clinicians I I have forgotten, that description and classification are primary in science. DuPrel, Schemer, and Saint-Denys anticipated recent rating systems of dream bizarreness by calling attention to the positive and negative sides of dreaming. Dreaming tends always toward a delirium syndrome, but the corresponding impairment of verbal-reflective thinking allows a positive release of visual-spatial metaphor and intuition, the frames or modules of mind that are based on a relative simultaneity of expression.

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remain~<br>

  Abstract: In der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus wurden 130.000 bis 150.000 ÖsterreicherInnen aus „rassischen“ oder politischen Gründen zur Emigration gezwungen, die überwiegende Mehrheit davon Juden (Stadler, „Emigration“ 17). Schon lange vor der Machtübernahme des Nationalsozialismus hatten viele junge ForscherInnen jüdischer Herkunft und/oder linker politischer Gesinnung Österreich verlassen, da ihnen seit Anfang der 1920er Jahre Berufslaufbahnen an den Universitäten zusehends verwehrt wurden (Feichtinger, „Braindrain“ 286-98; Taschwer 99-132).

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

The intense debate about people’s ability to move and the transfer of goods and ideas and about ways to deal with unregulated migration reflects a complex web of movements and their assigned meanings.

  Book Title: Music and Embodied Cognition-Listening, Moving, Feeling, and Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): COX ARNIE<br>
  Abstract: Taking a cognitive approach to musical meaning, Arnie Cox explores embodied experiences of hearing music as those that move us both consciously and unconsciously. In this pioneering study that draws on neuroscience and music theory, phenomenology and cognitive science, Cox advances his theory of the "mimetic hypothesis," the notion that a large part of our experience and understanding of music involves an embodied imitation in the listener of bodily motions and exertions that are involved in producing music. Through an often unconscious imitation of action and sound, we feel the music as it moves and grows. With applications to tonal and post-tonal Western classical music, to Western vernacular music, and to non-Western music, Cox's work stands to expand the range of phenomena that can be explained by the role of sensory, motor, and affective aspects of human experience and cognition.<br>

  Abstract: Observers of American popular culture may recognize Genesis 1-3 as a text hotly defended by scientific creationists who want the “biblical account of creation” to be taught alongside evolutionary theories in the public schools. Long before Genesis 1-3 sparked debates about the teaching of science, however, interpreters were turning to—and arguing about—other foundational issues raised by the text. For centuries, the biblical account of creation has prompted readers to propose very different notions about what it means to be a man or to be a woman.<br>

  Book Title: Desi Divas-Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Desi Divas: Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performancesis the product of five years of field research with progressive activists associated with the School for Indian Languages and Cultures (SILC), South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), the feminist dance collective Post Natyam, and the grassroots feminist political organization South Asian Sisters. Christine L. Garlough explores how traditional cultural forms may be critically appropriated by marginalized groups and used as rhetorical tools to promote deliberation and debate, spur understanding and connection, broaden political engagement, and advance particular social identities. Within this framework she examines how these performance activists advocate a political commitment to both justice and care, to both deliberative discussion and deeper understanding. To consider how this might happen in diasporic performance contexts, Garlough weaves together two lines of thinking. One grows from feminist theory and draws upon a core literature concerning the ethics of care. The other comes from rhetoric, philosophy, and political science literature on recognition and acknowledgment. This dual approach is used to reflect upon South Asian American women's performances that address pressing social problems related to gender inequality, immigration rights, ethnic stereotyping, hate crimes, and religious violence.<br>

  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism. The book will appeal to both those actively involved in religious negotiation and to scholars and students of religion in history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and political science.<br>

  Abstract: Ancient Greece would seem to be the easy case when it comes to the axial age. Greece gave rise to a form of democracy based on decisions made after rational argument in the assembly; to philosophy, including formal logic (second-order reasoning); to at least the beginnings of science based on evidence and argument; not to mention that it also gave rise to extraordinary artistic and literary achievements. Some have been so overwhelmed by the culture of ancient Greece as to imagine a “Greek miracle” emerging, without forerunners or rivals, full-blown from the head of Zeus so to speak. The Greeks<br>

  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts. Global in nature, these "culture wars" exacerbate the tensions between tradition and innovation, virtue and freedom. Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

  Abstract: “Mobilizing democracy” is a stirring catchphrase, and it was a well-chosen theme for the 2005 meeting of one of the largest social science associations in the United States.¹ In choosing that theme, the organizers obviously wanted to establish a broad agenda, both nationally and globally. In fact, although couched as an ongoing process, the motto can readily be translated into a directive or even an imperative that postulates “mobilize democracy” or “spread democracy everywhere” or simply “democratize the world.” The directive is stirring and captivating—but also disorienting, given the serious malaise afflicting contemporary democracy both at home and abroad.<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

Indeed, Godard’s film even features a deranged scientist-villain, Leonard Von Braun (Howard Vernon), as the chief human agent of this alien colonization who has himself been converted into the apparently perfect scientific-technocratic man without a trace of human emotion.

  Abstract: Hermeneutical theology is a distinct approach to theology. Hermeneutics itself is the science of interpretation.¹ Since Christianity is a textually based religion shaped by and oriented around a particular set of symbols, Christian theology needs to reinterpret its significant doctrines, texts,² and symbols for each new generation and within each new culture in which it emerges. Such interpretation is necessary for several reasons: on anthropological grounds, in light of the principle of analogy, because of the nature of foundational documents themselves, and, finally, in light of the hermeneutics of suspicion.³<br>

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Offering a critical view of all the texts in which Wittgenstein mentions Freud, Bouveresse immerses us in the intellectual climate of Vienna in the early part of the twentieth century. Although we come to see why Wittgenstein did not view psychoanalysis as a science proper, we are nonetheless made to feel the philosopher's sense of wonder and respect for the cultural task Freud took on as he found new ways meaningfully to discuss human concerns. Intertwined in this story of Wittgenstein's grappling with the theory of the unconscious is the story of how he came to question the authority of science and of philosophy itself. While aiming primarily at the clarification of Wittgenstein's opinion of Freud, Bouveresse's book can be read as a challenge to the French psychoanalytic school of Lacan and as a provocative commentary on cultural authority.<br>

  Abstract: At least in the Western context, our age is commonly referred to as that of “modernity”—a term sometimes qualified as “late modernity” or “post-modernity.” Taken by itself, the term is nondescript; in its literal sense, it simply means a time of novelty or innovation. Hence, something needs to be added to capture the kind of novelty involved. To pinpoint this innovation, modernity is also referred to as the “age of reason” or the age of enlightenment and science—in order to demarcate the period from a prior age presumably characterized by unreason, metaphysical speculation, and intellectual obscurantism or darkness.<br>

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

For what distinguishes Jungius—and not just in the eyes of Leibniz, who entered into genuine partnership with this great pathbreaker of seventeenth-century science—is a decisive departure from dialectical and hermeneutic modes of proceeding and a turn toward empiricism and demonstrative logic (albeit purged of slavish devotion to Aristotle).

Until the end of the nineteenth century, it usually took the form of a theory that promised to lay out the rules governing the discipline of interpretation. Its purpose was predominantly normative, even technical. Hermeneutics limited itself to giving methodological directions to the specifically interpretive sciences, with the end of avoiding arbitrariness in interpretation as far as possible. Virtually unknown to outsiders, it long maintained the status of an “auxiliary discipline” within the established disciplines that concerned themselves with interpreting texts<br>

It remains to turn our attention back toward the “in” of consciousness. Human consciousness is inseparable from a being-in-the-world. The life worlds of sentient creatures are also “in” the physical universe as understood by modern physical science. Accordingly, we would expect the being of sentient creatures to be broadly<br>

  Abstract: Scholars attempt to resolve the problem of the book of Ecclesiastes’ heterodox character in one of two ways, either explaining away the book’s disturbing qualities or radicalizing and championing it as a precursor of modern existentialism. This volume offers an interpretation of Ecclesiastes that both acknowledges the unorthodox nature of Qoheleth’s words and accounts for its acceptance among the canonical books of the Hebrew Bible. It argues that, instead of being the most secular and modern of biblical books, Ecclesiastes is perhaps one of the most religious and primitive. Bringing a Weberian approach to Ecclesiastes, it represents a paradigm of the application of a social-science methodology.<br>

  Abstract: We are in the midst of a multiyear centennial celebration of cinema’s beginnings. Motion pictures had their first première just over one hundred years ago, on 9 May 1893, when George M. Hopkins gave a lecture on Thomas A. Edison’s new motion picture system, the kinetoscope and kinetograph camera, at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Science. When the lecture concluded, at least two twenty-second films were shown: Blacksmithing Scene and Horse Shoeing. Four hundred people in attendance lined up in front of Edison’s peep-hole kinetoscope and one by one looked into the viewer and saw one of these two<br>

They do so by focusing on heteronormative control over children’s gender and sexuality or, to be more precise, the social insistence that children cannot<br>

  Abstract: There is a significant difference between a person being considered to be ʹprofessionalʹ in their approach to conducting business, whatever that business may be, and a person being part of a profession and therefore considered to be a professional. This difference has created enormous misunderstanding and confusion within the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, and hampered its progress towards being recognised as a profession. Being part of a profession is a vocation requiring knowledge of some department of learning or science, for example, medicine, law, engineering, architecture, accountancy and, more recently, ICT.<br>

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

  Abstract: It is a foolish commentator indeed who would attempt to claim a precise moment in history when anthropology in the French-speaking world

That anthropology was one of the handmaidens of colonialism, a science of empire, is indisputable and well documented. For many, the postcolonial turn has yet to occur and anthropology is still irredeemably and fatally tainted by its colonial origins.<br>

  Abstract: Following Castoriadis, I shall understand by ‘modernity’ the conjunction of two key significations: autonomy and control. Autonomy refers to the freedom of a society to make its own laws; control has to do with the expansion of rational mastery over the world of things, including the development of science and technology and their application to production and the control of nature (Castoriadis 1990: 15–17). Peter Wagner has developed this idea more precisely into an ‘interpretative approach’, which focuses on the responses that human beings give to certain basic

  Abstract: Le premier défi de la démocratie est de donner le «goût de l'avenir» (Alexis de Tocqueville), de générer l'enthousiasme qui poussera les jeunes d'esprit à progresser d'eux-mêmes vers de nouvelles quêtes de sens et de savoir, à renouveler peut-être surtout, dans le contexte des nouvelles connaissances et d'une prise de conscience accrue des richesses des différentes cultures, les questions que l'on appelle «ultimes et les plus hautes», pour citer Husserl, celles que la science exclut par principe et qui sont pourtant «les questions les plus brûlantes», portant «sur le sens ou sur l'absence de sens de toute cette existence humaine». Le simple mot

Une éducation qui exclurait, comme tranchées d'avance, ces questions ultimes, ne serait nullement à la hauteur de l'humain. Les essais composant ce livre explorent six d'entre elles, à savoir la dignité humaine, l'intelligence, la liberté, le bonheur, la mort et la beauté.<br>

  Abstract: Many humanities and social science scholars today are committed to, or at any rate, pay lip service to ideals of interdisciplinarity and methodological cross-fertilization. In light of this fact, it is remarkable that there should be so little dialogue between historians of philosophy (including those who study political and religious philosophy) and intellectual historians, particularly with respect to study of ‘non-Western’ thought systems or world views. A common tendency among intellectual historians today is to reduce history of philosophy to a minor province of philosophical hermeneutics.

This is the opening statement of a work that is considered to be the genealogical moment in the creation of aesthetics as an autonomous philosophical field—a creation prompted by the need to rescue the senses from the primacy of reason.

  Author(s) WHEELER WENDY<br>
  Abstract: In this essay I explore an ecocritical theory of cultural, and thus also literary, creativity from a biosemiotic point of view. While what follows might be thought broadly to fall within what is sometimes called the “post” humanities, in fact biosemiotics is a thoroughly interdisciplinary proto-discipline; it seeks not only to change how humanists think about culture, the arts, and the biological sciences but also to change how scientists and social scientists think about biological science and the arts and humanities.<br>

  Book Title: Essays on Giordano Bruno-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): GATTI HILARY<br>
  Abstract: The book is divided into sections that address three broad subjects: the relationship between Bruno and the new science, the history of his reception in English culture, and the principal characteristics of his natural philosophy. A final essay examines why this advocate of a "tranquil universal philosophy" ended up being burned at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition. While the essays take many different approaches, they are united by a number of assumptions: that, although well versed in magic, Bruno cannot be defined primarily as a Renaissance Magus; that his aim was to articulate a new philosophy of nature; and that his thought, while based on ancient and medieval sources, represented a radical rupture with the philosophical schools of the past, helping forge a path toward a new modernity.<br>

  Abstract: Giordano bruno was born only five years after the first publication of Copernicus’s
                  De revolutionibusin 1543, and only thirty-odd years after Martin Luther’s excommunication from the Catholic Church had divided Europe and its culture into two militantly hostile factions. Bruno’s lifetime in the second half of the sixteenth century thus covers a vital if often turbulent moment of cultural transition, which would radically affect the history of both science and the humanities. This chapter will primarily be concerned with his thinking about language, and especially with his thoughts about metaphor, thus aligning itself with an interpretative model of early<br>

  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

The charges are now well rehearsed: Objective criteria could not be established, and prediction remained elusive.

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

Our conceptual systems, they argued, are not copies of eternal forms underlying the sensory flux; they are instrumental constructs that overlie an experiential stream irreducible to rational formulation.

Precisely where the structuralist enterprise attempts to usurp the task of hermeneutics, as Paul Ricoeur points out, it oversteps its limits as a science.¹ On the other hand, philosophies of language that begin from the thinking subject and postulate a prelinguistic consciousness<br>

Focusing on texts written or influenced by anthropologists between 1900 and 1945, the work relates current perspectives on anthropology's discursive nature to the literary period known as "Modernism.".<br>

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

The diversity of literatures analyzing neo-corporatism, new social movements, New Left and post-modern politics indicates that the theoretical perspectives on liberal democracy which dominated political science and sociology after 1945 required reconceptualization. Moreover, since the political events provoking new theory occurred in conjunction with a profound crisis and restructuring of economic relations, even political economy approaches began to reassess representation.<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

As is often argued in current discussions on the theme, the adequate theological appropriation of the scientific approach to the study of the natural universe is possible only if nature and the universe are treated not as an “environment” for physical and biological existence, but as creation. This implies not only a dispassionate study of the universe which is contingent upon God,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0tp8">By Bread Alone</a><br>
  Author(s) Wilson-Reitz Megan T.<br>
  Abstract: The most common reading of the parable of the Friend at Midnight (Luke 11:1-10) holds that it is about generosity, the requirement to give to those who ask, and the trust that God will supply one’s own needs. Social-science commentary, as exemplified by Bruce Malina and Richard Rohrbaugh, adds the further dimensions of patronage and hospitality in the context of honor and shame: “Thus the petitioner threatens to expose the potential shamelessness of the sleeper. By morning the entire village would know of his refusal to provide hospitality. He thus gives in to avoid public exposure as a shameless person.”¹<br>

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

  Abstract: What is it to be human? What are our specifically human attributes, our capacities and liabilities?Such questions gave birth to anthropology as an Enlightenment science. This book argues that it is again appropriate to bring "the human" to the fore, to reclaim the singularity of the word as central to the anthropological endeavor, not on the basis of thesubstanceof a human nature - "To be human is to act like this and react like this, to feel this and want this" - but in terms of species-widecapacities: capabilities for action and imagination, liabilities for suffering and cruelty. The contributors approach "the human" with an awareness of these complexities and particularities, rendering this volume unique in its ability to build on anthropology's ethnographic expertise.<br>

  Book Title: Origins and Ends of the Mind-Philosophical Essays on Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis claims that the individual human mind is structured by its childhood relationships with its parents. But the theory of attachment, evolutionary psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind have all recently re-introduced new dimensions of innateness into mental development and pathology. If attachment is an instinct, then what is the psychological status of the child's relation to the mother? If the mind is in part a product of evolution, then how far down do the inhibitory mechanisms of the mind go? If the mind of the child is shaped by their encounter with a set of prohibitions, how, in the light of contemporary 'cognitive science' and philosophy of mind, can the child be conceived as 'taking on' a rule? How is the construction of the mind related to the normative ends of cognitive experience? Today, it is Lacanian psychoanalysis which most vigorously defends psychoanalytic theory and practice from the encroachment of the biological and 'cognitive' sciences. But a paradigm shift nevertheless appears to be underway, in which the classical psychoanalytic theories about the Oedipus complex, primary and secondary repression, sexual difference and psychosexuality, the role of symbols,etc, are being dismantled and reintegrated into a new synthesis of biological and psychological theories. In this collection of theoretical essays by philosophers and psychoanalysts, encounters are brought about between Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis on the one hand, and attachment theory, evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind on the other.<br>

  Book Title: Subversion, Conversion, Development-Cross-Cultural Knowledge Exchange and the Politics of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Lee<br>
  Abstract: This book explores alternative cultural encounters with and around information technologies. These encounters are alternative because they counter dominant, Western-oriented notions of media consumption; they include media practices as forms of cultural resistance and subversion, "DIY cultures," and other nonmainstream models of technology production. The contributors -- leading thinkers in science and technology studies, anthropology, and software design -- pay special attention to the specific inflections that different cultures and communities give to the value of knowledge. The richly detailed accounts presented here challenge the dominant view of knowledge as a neutral good -- information available for representation and encoding but separated from all social relations. The chapters examine specific cases in which the forms of knowledge and cross-cultural encounters are shaping technology use and development. They consider design, use, and reuse of technological tools, including databases, GPS devices, books, and computers, in locations that range from Australia and New Guinea to Germany and the United States.ContributorsPoline Bala, Alan Blackwell, Wade Chambers, Michael Christie, Hildegard Diemberger, Stephen Hugh-Jones, James Leach, Jerome Lewis, Dawn Nafus, Gregers Petersen, Marilyn Strathern, David Turnbull, Helen Verran, Laura Watts, Lee Wilson<br>

But the gap between fantasy and actual technological capacity is closing, so that now the morality of power must speak to the governance of power; ethics must inform public policy.

  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle ~<br>

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Abstract: Since Thomas Kuhn’s characterization of science by means of a list of epistemic values that provide “

Kuhn’s list comprised such values as empirical accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness (Kuhn 1977, 321–22), which, as he argued, can be seen as constitutive of science. An enterprise could have different criteria for judging theories, but then it would not be science (331).<br>

  Abstract: MY SUBJECT in this lecture is perhaps more concerned with the human reaction to cosmology rather than with cosmology itself, since I have become more and more fascinated with the way the human muid responds to changes and advances in science. Cosmology excites particularly strong, varied and interesting responses, for the subject matter is the structure and history of the universe as a whole. It is therefore not in the least surprising that people have been fascinated by it for thousands of years. Nor is it surprising that it belongs among the most speculative and rapidly varying subjects in the<br>

  Abstract: Science (from the Latin,

The term has since come to mean empirical, experimentally acquired knowledge and, as such, refers to some of the most powerful tools we have for understanding the world and indeed our own physiology. Scientific medicine has led to huge improvements in outcomes from a variety of conditions, from infectious diseases to cancer and heart disease. These advances have come, largely, from a mechanistic or reductionist approach to illness, which focuses on putting the body, understood as a physical<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will examine social philosophy in the nineteenth century in terms of three interrelated processes: the consolidation of a conception of society or the social; the reformulation of issues of poverty and inequality in the form of ‘the social question’ and related attempts at social regulation; and the emergence of the social sciences ‘between literature and science’ (see Lepenies [1985] 1988). Although the term ‘rise’ may seem to suggest an inevitable or desirable process, we shall see that the status of the social sciences and the relation between the social and the political were no less contentious at the<br>

  Abstract: The neurological material in the foregoing chapter operates within an ontology and epistemology that many in the social sciences have long fought against. At its hard scientific edge, this belief holds that human behaviour is fully explicable through close study of the operations of the brain. All social science and theory would therefore, in time, be superseded by an all-embracing explanatory vocabulary of neurophysiological brainstates. Before we can proceed to unpack such material for use in a political context, this fundamental concern must first be addressed.<br>

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

Whereas this method has not been widely used in social science, group interviews are common in market research to investigate consumer motivation and behaviour.

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Herrnstein Smith Barbara<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the radical reconceptions of knowledge and science emerging from constructivist epistemology, social studies of science, and contemporary cognitive science. Smith reviews the key issues involved in the twentieth-century critiques of traditional views of human knowledge and scientific truth and gives an extensively informed explanation of the alternative accounts developed by Fleck, Kuhn, Foucault, Latour, and others. She also addresses the various anxieties (e.g., over ‘relativism’) and ‘wars’ occasioned by these developments, placing them in their historical contexts and arguing that they are largely misplaced or spurious. Smith then examines the currently perplexed relations between the natural and human sciences, the grandiose claims and dubious methods of evolutionary psychology, and the complex play of naturalist, humanist, and posthumanist ideologies in contemporary views of the relation between humans and animals.<br>

  Book Title: Modernism and Magic-Experiments with Spiritualism, Theosophy and the Occult<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Leigh<br>
  Abstract: While modernism’s engagement with the occult has been approached by critics as the result of a loss of faith in representation, an attempt to draw on science as the primary discourse of modernity, or as a hidden history of ideas, Leigh Wilson argues that these discourses have at their heart a magical practice which remakes the relationship between world and representation. As Wilson demonstrates, the courses of the occult are based on a magical mimesis which transforms the nature of the copy, from inert to vital, from dead to alive, from static to animated, from powerless to powerful. Wilson explores the aesthetic and political implications of this relationship in the work of those writers, artists and filmmakers who were most self-consciously experimental, including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Dziga Vertov and Sergei M. Eisenstein.<br>

  Book Title: Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis was the most important intellectual development of the twentieth century, which left no practice from psychiatry to philosophy to politics untouched. Yet it was also in many ways an untouchable project, caught between science and poetry, medicine and hermeneutics. This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapters pinpointed a new form of the ancient relationship between ‘slavery’ and ‘alienation’ emerging at the origins of psychoanalysis in the form of the relationship between drug-addiction and sexuality. The first chapter also showed how this emergence was coterminous with Freud’s forced transition from scientific experimentation to linguistic interlocution; that is, it entailed Freud’s departure from a strictly scientific field and directed him into situations that, while never abandoning a guiding ideal of science, required supplementation by the extra-scientific armature derived from a form of attentiveness to ‘literature’. In terms of the ‘therapy’ offered by psychoanalysis, this required<br>

  Author(s): Saltz David Z.<br>
  Abstract: The fifteen original essays in
      Staging Philosophymake useful connections between the discipline of philosophy and the fields of theater and performance and use these insights to develop new theories about theater. Each of the contributors-leading scholars in the fields of performance and philosophy-breaks new ground, presents new arguments, and offers new theories that will pave the way for future scholarship.Staging Philosophyraises issues of critical importance by providing case studies of various philosophical movements and schools of thought, including aesthetics, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, deconstruction, critical realism, and cognitive science. The essays, which are organized into three sections-history and method, presence, and reception-take up fundamental issues such as spectatorship, empathy, ethics, theater as literature, and the essence of live performance. While some essays challenge assertions made by critics and historians of theater and performance, others analyze the assumptions of manifestos that prescribe how practitioners should go about creating texts and performances. The first book to bridge the disciplines of theater and philosophy,Staging Philosophywill provoke, stimulate, engage, and ultimately bring theater to the foreground of intellectual inquiry while it inspires further philosophical investigation into theater and performance.David Krasneris Associate Professor of Theater Studies, African American Studies, and English at Yale University.

  Book Title: Strung Together-The Cultural Currency of String Theory as a Scientific Imaginary<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Sean<br>
  Abstract: In
      Strung Together: The Cultural Currency of String Theory as a Scientific Imaginary,Sean Miller examines the cultural currency of string theory, both as part of scientific discourse and beyond it. He demonstrates that the imaginative component of string theory is both integral and indispensable to it as a scientific discourse. While mathematical arguments provide precise prompts for physical intervention in the world, the imaginary that supplements mathematical argument within string theory technical discourse allows theorists to imagine themselves interacting with the cosmos as an abstract space in such a way that strings and branes as phenomena become substantiated and legitimized. And it is precisely this sort of imaginary-which Miller calls ascientific imaginary-duly substantiated and acculturated, that survives the move from string theory technical discourse to popularizations and ultimately to popular and literary discourses. In effect, a string theory imaginary legitimizes the science itself and helps to facilitate a virtual domestication of a cosmos that was heretofore remote, alien, and incomprehensible.<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

  Abstract: The dangers of misapplied science, fully realized in the Salem witchcraft trials and the events’ larger context in Royal Society debates, put tremendous pressure on the science of the soul. By the late-seventeenth century, Harvard-trained ministers and Royal Society natural philosophers continued to advance their practices, though with renewed caution, aware both of mechanical philosophy’s limitations and the parameters surrounding empirical inquiry—especially interdictions against studying preternatural phenomena. Yet neither New England ministers nor London natural philosophers abandoned efforts to apply empirical methods to advance knowledge of God. Rather, such theologians as Samuel Clarke recuperated the goal of knowing the<br>

  Abstract: André Bazin was influenced by many philosophical figures. This range of influences was no gratuitous eclecticism. Rather, it stemmed from Bazin’s need to develop a critical discourse that would address the impure ontology of the cinema. Because the medium involves nature and culture, it perforce requires insights into art, religion, science, and technology. Without a doubt, the history of philosophy helped Bazin bring together all these dimensions, even if he seldom identified his sources. As a critic he did not seek a perfect fit between his overall film theory and a single philosopher. Bazin never mentioned the names of Saint<br>

Behind this haze at the periphery of detective fiction, the dichotomy between hero (detective) and villain (criminal), the genre’s central setup, was also being undermined. Prominent but deranged agents of science—such as research scientists, engineers, and doctors—started to appear more often as serial killers than as models of scientific morality.

Theories and expressions of atavism in these representational spheres reveal the way modern thought oriented itself around a paradigm of obsolescence and return that structured the experience of modern time.

In these straits, philosophy has turned increasingly to criticism for an understanding of its activity, and so has risked also its possible disappearance into literature.

  Abstract: Over his long and productive career, Jürgen Habermas has pursued an overriding interest in critical social-political theory. For Habermas, as for other Frankfurt School critical theorists, social-political critique requires interdisciplinary social analysis and thus depends on engagement with the social and cultural sciences. In the 1960s, Habermas approached such engagement as a problem for methodological and epistemological reflection, that is, a matter of critique of knowledge (

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

It then took millennia more before writing expanded from administrative recordkeeping to historiography, philosophy, natural science, and what we now generally mean by “literature.” All the while, writing remained<br>

  Abstract: The good clinician, like the good pastor or rabbi of religious traditions, learns quickly that to help people get better we must link them to their and our myths, that is, to 
                  our narratives. For American psychiatrists and many psychotherapists, this means we should use the “five-of-nine” rule and similar rules announced in the DSM-IV, the bible of psychiatry. However, by doing so we find ourselves uncannily associated with science fiction and religion and their vast efforts to solve the problem of human being.

  Publisher: Wallflower Press<br>
  Author(s): GJELSVIK ANNE<br>
  Abstract: With
      Flags of Our Fathers(2006) andLetters from Iwo Jima(2006), Clint Eastwood made a unique contribution to film history, being the first director to make two films about the same event. Eastwood's films examine the battle over Iwo Jima from two nations' perspectives, in two languages, and embody a passionate view on conflict, enemies, and heroes. Together these works tell the story behind one of history's most famous photographs, Leo Rosenthal's "Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima." In this volume, international scholars in political science and film, literary, and cultural studies undertake multifaceted investigations into how Eastwood's diptych reflects war today. Fifteen essays explore the intersection among war films, American history, and Japanese patriotism. They present global attitudes toward war memories, icons, and heroism while offering new perspectives on cinema, photography, journalism, ethics, propaganda, war strategy, leadership, and the war on terror.<br>

  Abstract: In 1968 Jacques Derrida accepted an invitation from Johns Hopkins University to teach a seminar on the topic “Literature and Truth.” The project of the seminar was to consider how literature has been conceived, constructed, and maintained from Plato on as imitation and thus construed as secondary in order to protect the status of philosophy and, more broadly, science as the province of truth. Derrida developed the argument to show that the representative arts had been subsequently burdened with the task of effacing their position as copy by cultivating the value of originality, thus reproducing the very logic that established<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

Left-wing terrorism did not deter the philosopher from his quest for social progress, however, and in the 1980s, he introduced a daring formulation called "weak thought," which stripped metaphysics, science, religion, and all other absolute systems of their authority. Vattimo then became notorious both for his renewed commitment to the core values of Christianity (he was trained as a Catholic intellectual) and for the Vatican's denunciation of his views.<br>

  Abstract: Since the early 1990s hundreds of thousands of Tamil villagers in southern India have participated in literacy lessons, science demonstrations, and other events designed to transform them into active citizens with access to state power. These efforts to spread enlightenment among the oppressed are part of a movement known as the Arivoli Iyakkam (the Enlightenment Movement), considered to be among the most successful mass literacy movements in recent history. In

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

  Abstract: Nation as Grand Narrative offers a methodical analysis of how relations of domination and subordination are conveyed through media narratives of nationhood. Using the typical postcolonial state of Nigeria as a template and engaging with disciplines ranging from media studies, political science, and social theory to historical sociology and hermeneutics, Wale Adebanwi examines how the nation as grand narrative provides a critical interpretive lens through which competition among ethnic, ethnoregional, and ethnoreligious groups can be analyzed. Adebanwi illustrates how meaning is connected to power through ideology in the struggles enacted on the pages of the print media over diverse issues including federalism, democracy and democratization, religion, majority-minority ethnic relations, space and territoriality, self-determination, and threat of secession. Nation as Grand Narrative will trigger further critical reflections on the articulation of relations of domination in the context of postcolonial grand narratives.

  Abstract: Within the strongly empiricist framework of American social science, there is very little acknowledgment of the nonempirical, theoretically driven dimension of scientific change. Yet the major developments in social science do not emerge primarily from simple accumulation of empirical knowledge or from proving previous theories false. They grow from confrontations with other, hegemonic theories. These confrontations, which are often intense and highly emotional, may take the form of critical experiments that crystallize and operationalize more general commitments, but they usually also present themselves as more general, less empirical arguments about theoretical logic itself.<br>

  Abstract: If we go back to the 1920s, we find philosophies of knowledge which for the most part exempted science from the realm of explanation. The first people who pushed into a sociology of science were Marxists in the 1930s: J. D. Bernal in England, Bernard Stern on this side of the Atlantic, and others who had rather strong ideological concerns about why science should not be exempt from being seen as part of a social system and hence molded to social purposes. This line of analysis largely disappeared for some time, but not without leaving a residue, and not without<br>

  Abstract: It should be no coincidence that the great interest in heroes as well as the beginning of the study of heroic myth falls on the high age of nationalism. It was also the high age of revolutions, of the advent of mass politics, of science, and the passionate struggle between a numbers of -isms: conservatism, liberalism, socialism, republicanism, romanticism, anarchism, and so on. No wonder that the great debate in an era that saw the shaping of several social science disciplines was about the role of individuals in history, notably heroes, versus the blind operation of structural forces and social<br>

  Author(s) Czigányik Zsolt<br>
  Abstract: Since science fiction’s¹ advent in the early nineteenth century, concerns with humanity’s end have been one of the central issues thematized by the genre, abounding especially after World War II, when human self-destruction became a disturbing and looming possibility via the development of nuclear weapons and the mounting political tensions of the Cold War. These SF works, both printed and filmic, have certain things in common: they involve a cataclysmic event which brings about the epic destruction of humanity; they verbalize or visualize a collective trauma—human-induced disasters, natural catastrophes, or extra-terrestrial calamities; and depending on the scale of the<br>

  Abstract: Although half a century ago it may have seemed surprising, by today we are quite used to the idea that early modern Humanism was by no means the enlightened and rational period as some interpreters of the Renaissance wanted to see and to have it seen. Decades of research in science-and cultural history as well as in historical anthropology has made it manifest that many brilliant minds of the great generation of fifteenth and sixteenth-century humanists not only believed in astrology, alchemy, and in a host of demons and spirits surrounding them, but quite often they even engaged in sometimes<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.) But my whole point was to find a way to go beyond our own experiential closeness to intelle~<br>

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Abstract: Despite this, metaphysics has indeed replied (whether it should be allowed to or not) to the question concerning man’s definition of himself. And we know well that the Cartesian
         cogitohas no other importance than to assure theegoits comprehension of itself and thus to impose itself as the first principle of every other science. Nevertheless, it would be more fitting to doubt this vulgate of Cartesianism, because the texts of Descartes so often contradict it. Contradiction occurs first of all because theego’s very performance of its existence unfolds within a space that is, from the outset, dialogical (with theDeus qui potest omnia, with thegenius aliquis malignius).43Next, contradiction occurs because theegoof thecogitorecognizes that its finite thought culminates in a faculty of will that is paradoxically infinite, “ratione cujus imaginem quandam et similitudinem Dei me refere intelligo” (“in virtue of [which] … I understand myself to bear in some way the image and likeness of God”); and above all the common understanding of the comprehensibility of theegois contradicted because theegoidentifies its faculty of thinking of itself with the image and likeness of God within it, to the point that the faculty of self‐knowing is simply one with the faculty of knowing God: “ex hoc uno quod Deus me creavit, valde credibile est me quodammodo ad imaginem et similitudinem ejus factum esse, illamque similitudinem, in qua Dei idea continetur, a me precipi per eandem facultatem, per quam ego ipse a me percipior” (“but the mere fact that God created me is a very strong basis for believing that I am somehow made in his image and likeness and that I perceive that likeness, which includes the idea of God, by the same faculty which enables me to perceive myself”).44Let us consider this extraordinary text: founding the thinking of self upon my thinking of God, to the point of merging them within the space opened by the image of and likeness to God. Even more: because Descartes~<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: For Kant, a “boundary” always presupposes a positive conception of the enclosing region (e.g., the field of noumena) beyond the enclosed space (e.g., the “field of experience”), defining a shared border where the two spaces “touch” (sec. 57). In contrast, a “limit” defines a border as merely a negation of an incomplete quantitative series. Theoretical reason (mathematics and natural science) has no boundary; new cognition extends to infinity. Bourgeois’s main point is that the very enterprise of critique founders without its boundary relation to the positive content provided by the Ideas of Reason (ideas of the completion of the series of conditions)—in particular, as “postulates of pure reason” practically indispensable for obedience to the objectively binding moral law. Bourgeois cites Kant: “[The end of reason] is ‘to point out to us actually not only the bounds of the pure use of reason, but also the way to determine them’” (p. 43). What grounds critique and critical metaphysics is not reason in its conditioned use, the understanding (
      Verstand) and its categories; rather, it is reason (Vernunft) in its unconditioned use that establishes the sources of cognition, their domain, boundaries, and relations.<br>

Abstract: With regard to individual lives and libraries in the life of persons, Wiegand points to the failure of information science to “construct models of a personal ‘information economy’ for individuals,” ones that analyze how individuals appropriate information “in efforts to make sense of the world around them in their everyday lives” [
         2, p. 24]. He argues that, relative to other disciplines, researchers in LIS have not benefited from the critical thinking that has been available; he cites, for example, work done on the relationship of power to knowledge. Invoking Douglas Zweizig, he calls for a switch in emphasis to the library in the life of the user and away from the user in the life of the library, which has so captured our imaginations to date. Furthermore, he concludes that the arena of study we call “information science” continues to be defined by the technology that is characteristic of the field as we know it today. He argues that, built on expertise rather than authority, this discourse, with its focus on technology, renders people and their culture invisible; those not using the technologies at the heart of information science are being ignored [3].<br>

Abstract: Here I would argue in similar fashion to Aijaz Ahmed ([
         1987] 1992) that many texts by women of color are not about access to the power to signify or about subverting either the central origin myths of Western culture or myths of original innocence. Texts like Jade Snow Wong’sFifth Chinese Daughter([1950] 1989), Le Ly Hayslip’sWhen Heaven and Earth Changed Places(1989), and Bharati Mukherjee’sJasmine(1989), for instance, affirm to an extent the binaries of Western rationality, modernity, and progress and Eastern irrationality, prejudice, and backwardness. Furthermore, the very assumption that texts by U.S. women of color are centrallyaboutsubverting Western myths suggests that minority texts are significant only insofar as they relate to the center. Many texts by U.S. women of color—Toni Morrison’sBeloved(1987) and Fae Myenne Ng’sBone(1993) are powerful examples—are not fundamentally about subverting Western myths. And simply to suggest that writings about women of color are “repeatedly about writing” is simply to reiterate the discursive postmodern truism that all fiction is metafiction. Moreover, the very distinction between women of color and feminist science fiction writers begs the obvious question: Is Butler (who is included in the category of feminist science fiction) not a woman of color?<br>

Abstract: While our study has helped us to map the history of theory in the pages of
      CI, it can also be used to identify new trends, figures whose stock is rising. Among these are Giorgio Agamben, first translated into English in 1991, who has been cited eight times, all in the last four years. And Étienne Balibar and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, all of whom have been cited ten times, all since 1997. Although Žižek was first cited in 1993, his works have been cited with much more frequency just in the last few years. Will he reach his plateau soon? Other scholars whose works are being cited with greater frequency include figures from newer areas like science studies (Bruno Latour, Ian Hacking) and media theory (Friedrich Kittler). Benjamin was cited thirteen times between 1974 and 1989, and then 134 times since, though this number is so high in part because of a special issue we devoted to his work in 1998. Still, the only other theorist on whom we have done a special issue—Mikhail Bakhtin—generated a total of twenty‐five citations, and he has been cited only four times in the last ten years.19Benjamin might be a case of a figure whose writings are so challenging that it takes time for their ideas to be put to use. Similar difficult theorists who have seen increases are Theodor Adorno (who died in 1969 but whose works become much more cited around the mid‐1990s) and Gilles Deleuze (whose popularity surged several years after his death in 1995).<br>

Abstract: Perspective exchange.—The idea that perspective exchange differs from information exchange, as well as the fact that it is essential for interreligious dialogue, crops up only sporadically in the theology of religions. There are three possible reasons: philosophical, civilizational, and religious reasons. Concerning the first reason: following a period of modern subject philosophy and ego psychology the insight in the “other as other,” “the other astotaliter aliter” in postmodern philosophy, has influenced people in such a manner that the simple fact of perspective exchange, as the basis of all relationships and communication of (higher animal species and) people, may have been lost. This is actually depressing, because the concept already has a long history. It emerged for the first time in American pragmatism, specifically in the symbolic interactionism of G. H. Mead.43Since then there has been a lot of research in both developmental and social psychology, and it has become a standard textbook concept.44In the past twenty years we have witnessed intensified interest in this concept, specifically in cognitive science, including cognitive psychology and cognitive anthropology, whether these disciplines use different, traditional, or new terms like role taking, social attribution, empathy, and “theory of the mind.”45According to research in these disciplines, perspective exchange seems to be a natural disposition of (higher animal species and) people; it starts developing at a very young age, and its roots lie in the functioning of the brain. Expressed negatively, the concept refers to the socioemotional disposition that enables people to step out of their own perspective in which they experience and interpret situations, other people, and themselves. It indicates, moreover, their ability to let go of their own desires, preferences, intentions, plans, and expectations. Expressed positively, it is the socioemotional disposition that enables people to switch to the per~<br>

Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
Abstract: The more unexpected motive and/or rationalization that emerges from Gergov's memoirs—unexpected because so abundantly evoked—is the mausoleum as the apotheosis of science. The constant refrain of his reports on the mausoleum staff's activities is that “everything was put on a strictly scientific basis.” Many more pages in these brief memoirs are devoted to the secrets of embalming than to the ideological significance of the mausoleum. A good quarter of the text deals with the intricate lighting with its halogen lamps and reverse mirrors, the special angles at which the lamps were installed, the electronic installations that preserved the exact temperature and humidity. What emerges from these pages is an uncanny pride in a purely scientific achievement: the embalming and preservation of the body was unprecedented in global science; the staff serving the mausoleum did everything based on scientific principles. This portrayal reminds one more of a surgeon's team than of a high priest's assistants.
         50Amazingly, the whole memoir closes not with comments on Dimitrov or the mausoleum but with a two‐page eulogy of Nikolai I. Pirogov, the nineteenth‐century Russian surgeon and scientist who took part in the Russo‐Turkish war of 1877–78 and after whom one of Sofia's premier hospitals is named. Pirogov was a champion of embalming and had done fundamental research in this field, as well as introducing antiseptics and ether anesthesia. His own body had been embalmed and then buried in 1881 in his home town of Vinitsa.51<br>

Abstract: On these grounds, theological ethics may make at least two important forms of critique of the recent social science emphasis on children’s agency. First, one can argue for a more complex view of children in and of themselves. As full human beings, children do not simply act on their world but rather interact in a passive‐active way with a world that itself shapes and influences their interpretations of their experiences. As well as conditions such as history, culture, power, and community, children also face the moral condition of having to learn to respond in an active‐passive way to others. Respecting children’s full humanity involves recognizing their fullest dimensions as both actively participating in and passively belonging to larger moral worlds. Indeed, few adults would, in the end, welcome being treated one‐dimensionally as agents alone. Overemphasizing children’s agency is just as simplistic and therefore dehumanizing as overemphasizing their need to be molded and socialized.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: If there is a creative dimension of moral activity, it must be sought, not just in creative products like narratives and literature, but more fundamentally or primordially on the level of human capabilities. Our question is not what actual goods human creative capabilities may create, but what it means for moral life to involve a creative capability. Rather than begin with theories of art, technology, or science, I want to begin instead with moral practice itself in order to peel back some of its own possible poetic presuppositions. If I do so through poetic texts like myths and symbols, this is only because these may more clearly reveal underlying human moral poetic capabilities.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: lq.2006.76.issue-3<br>
Date: 07 2006<br>
Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The concept of the good may apply particularly pointedly to professional codes of ethics. The codes are aimed at the positive right of free speech and also at professional responsibility. They attempt to articulate practical and normative standards of ethics. Both the ALA Code of Ethics and the American Society for Information Science and Technology Professional Guidelines speak in terms of responsibility to communities, to the profession, and to society as a whole. Public pronouncement of the codes does serve to affirm the existence of libraries as just institutions in a democracy. Related to the second scenario above, accuracy does fit with the good since it is in people’s interest to obtain accurate information that they can employ for their own well‐being. Advocacy is certainly not always and everywhere prohibited, but it is secondary to people’s right to information that is as accurate as it is possible to provide. Accuracy also embraces a commitment to truth, which recognizes a fundamental inequality of some information (the true and the false; refer again to the first scenario). It is generally taken to be responsible professionalism to check information sources against one another to corroborate information. This action, as Lynch observes, is not a substitute for truth; it is a means to truth (in the weak sense) [
         19, p. 81]. Toward the end of accuracy and truth, there are some closely related matters. For one thing, there have been some persistent challenges related to government information and its accessibility versus its effective suppression. This is an area in which advocacy and accuracy merge, with the common aim of presenting library users with the most authoritative information possible. Also, libraries’ access mechanisms, including subject headings, can benefit from advocacy directed toward language that encompasses the culture, linguistic distinctions, and other facets of the people who will search for information.<br>

Abstract: Saying that a responsible decision must be taken on the basis of knowledge seems to define the condition of possibility of responsibility (one can’t make a responsible decision without science or conscience, without knowing what one is doing, for what reasons, in view of what and under what conditions), at the same time as it defines the condition of impossibility of this same responsibility (if decision‐making is relegated to a knowledge that it is content to follow or to develop, then it is no more a responsible decision, it is the technical deployment of a … theorem).

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: According to Koselleck, the temporal structure of modern time, “our time,” appeared when the present was opened to both past and future through the agency of progress, which produced an asymmetry between experience and expectation. Historical time was henceforth contained and excluded by the enlargement of experience and expansion of the horizon of expectation engendered by progress and driven by the tension between them (see
         FP,p. 244). History became its own time, what Hegel (and later Koselleck) named “history itself” or history in general(Geschichte Selber)(FP,p. 246). But a category of “internal time”—even more than “our time”—presupposed and incorporated a complex discussion on the status of temporality and the philosophic assault on quantitative time. This assault was directed by the search for truer, qualitative time, seeking a perspective removed from the external world of things to counter the aptitude of a new objective science (FP,p. 247). It should be remembered that this assault from a distance was as much an attack on the capitalist commitment to quantitative, measurable, abstract time—demanded by exchange and paradigmatically expressed in the calculation of surplus value and labor time—as it was on breakthroughs in the physical sciences in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Koselleck’s own later attempt to conceptualize modernity was, as will become evident, yet another attempt to recover subjective—internal or psychological—time’s agency within the spatial envelope of the nation‐state as the condition of returning history back to a timeless hermeneutics, wherein narrative time and space were indistinguishable.<br>

Abstract: Although attention given to exploring the philosophical underpinnings of library and information science has grown in recent years, there has been little consideration of the philosophical problem of truth in librarianship. This is despite the possibility that considering the concept of truth may inform critical thinking about epistemological connections within library science and bring clarity and definition to the practical and theoretical uses of new terms, concepts, and ideas emerging in our profession as it is transformed by technology and other external social, political, and economic processes.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Narratography is keyed to the vicissitudes of plot as they are ferried along the routes and detours of syntax itself and the micromanagement of its lexical succession, including both the elisions and the blind spots of overdetermined figuration. Between the science of narratology and the practice of narratography, the basic methodological difference remains. Whatever narrative essentially may
         beas modal form, criticism might also want to ask how—and just where—a given narrative does what it does at once for, to, and with the reader. In registering this, narratography draws out a difference within—as well as across—the increments of narrative meaning. It thereby charts more closely the junctures and disjoins between rhetoric and writing, the imprinted inferences that may evade intent. Only in this way can it begin to graph the latently inscribed across the novelistic surface of the said. Hence the wager behind this paper's fantasized novel. The unnamed mother of Nobody is scarcely a universal plot matrix. Nonetheless, and though not typically personified in anything like this way, writing is always giving voice to, or at least loosing words for, more than it narrates, calling out on the run its own contradictions and evasions, telling more than the told.<br>

Abstract: In Augustine’s writings

The notion ofanimusis where Augustine draws the line differentiating animals from humans. The most potent activity or faculty ofanimusismens(De Trinitate15.7.11), and in fact on occasion Augustine identifies one with the other (De civitate Dei7.23).Ratio(rationality) andintelligentiaorintellectus(intelligence, intellect) are intrinsic tomens, as well asmemoriaandvoluntas(memory, will);ratiois the seat of the ability to distinguish and connect sense perceptions (De ordine2.11.30);intellectusis the seat of the ability to undertake an enlightened quest for truth (Tractatus in Ioannis Evangelium15.4.19;De Trinitate1.6.12, 4.2.4;De ordine2.2.5, 9.26).Scientia(science) results from the use ofratio;sapientia(wisdom) results from the use ofintellectus.13Moreover, the first specification ofmensis self‐awareness or self‐knowledge (De Trinitate9.12.18)—subjectivity, in other words: a self‐knowing subject is the presupposition, the anchoring ground of any knowing, remembering, purposeful activity on the part ofmens.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Abstract: By the time the SCS added media to its name in 2002, the transformation of the landscape had already occurred. One of the strongest new graduate programs to arise in the country, that of the University of Chicago, had baptized itself the Committee on Cinema and Media Studies. At Brown University, prominent film scholars work within a department called Modern Culture and Media. And the six‐hundred page
         The Oxford Handbook of Film and Media Studies, which the publisher describes as a “state‐of‐the‐art survey of current thinking and research” in the field as it now seems constituted, has now been published. Robert Kolker's fine introduction puts in play every permutation of the book's two key terms and the objects they deal with.
               Kolker, a former president of SCS, finds film studies to be hampered by being tied to a large yet circumscribed set of texts. It revolves around objects whose density is great enough to keep a complex array of issues in orbit. Media studies, on the other hand, is not tied down by such gravity. It floats through a universe that contains artifacts of all sorts, not just the beautiful Milky Way of films but other galaxies, gaseous clouds, space junk, and the solar winds that carry it along. Artifacts precipitate from the processes and forces that are media studies' true concern. Once nearly the exclusive province of social science approaches, this field has emerged within the humanities as a type of cultural studies. The latter, while infiltrating and sometimes taking over numerous departments, seldom constitutes an academic unit since the topics it takes up are so vast, so variegated, and so amorphous.Traditional film studies starts with the individual work, genre, or director, and moves outward to larger issues of the ideologies of production and reception, to gender issues, to the effects of distribution on viewership, and increasingly to the ways globalization is affecting national cinemas, always attempting to solidif~<br>

Abstract: Overall, the essays in this volume admirably correct theology’s tendency to exploit other disciplines for its own purposes. However, there is also the danger that literary-cultural-anthropological approaches will displace theology. A tensional conjunction of literature and theology could prove especially useful for comparative theology. However, with the exception of Darroch’s essay, there is no serious engagement in this volume with non-Christian theology—and, even here, the result is more comparative anthropology than comparative theology. In a similar but more explicit fashion, Mattias Martinson calls for a post-Christian interdisciplinarity that severs theology’s historical ties to Christian practice. Theology thus becomes another cultural science—“a displaced cultural language of the secular” (78)—but can one still call this theology?<br>

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: The central claim is that religious narratives shape sociopolitical positions, a commonplace observation that Gutterman embellishes by asserting “that this religiosity often takes on a prophetic cast” (p. 49). Such assertions, however, are also quite common in studies of American religion and politics (think of Perry Miller, Robert Bellah, and Sacvan Bercovitch) and they would benefit from a more precise articulation of the relation between religion and politics. While he adroitly ranges over political material (especially in his insightful use of Hannah Arendt and Paul Ricoeur), Gutterman's grasp of other subjects is sometimes shaky. He claims that his approach displaces “the common view of the status of religion in American political culture” (p. 3), yet the two conventional methods he names—jurisprudential/Constitutional or policy‐oriented studies—scantly exemplify the range of understandings in either the academy or public life. Gutterman cites Alexis de Tocqueville as exemplifying a distinct “third mode of scholarship” (p. 3) that, in contrast to “a functional approach to American religiosity” (p. 8), underscores the importance of religion in American culture. Such functionalism may dominate political science, but this is far from the case in religious studies, history, or American studies, where the significance of religion is a given.<br>

Publisher: University of Missouri Press<br>
Issue: jpolitics.68.issue-2<br>
Date: 05 2004<br>
Author(s): Eubanks Cecil<br>
Abstract: In spite of their differences, both Strauss' and Voegelin's analyses of Plato partake in the common task of recovering the Platonic-Aristotelian science against positivism. Both Strauss and Voegelin were opposed to abstract, ideological, and positivist thought, and both sought to renew political science by returning to a philosophical anthropology rooted in Plato and Aristotle. With respect to politics, both Strauss and Voegelin were worried about liberalism: As Ted V. McAllister wrote in
         Revolt Against Modernity, “they were worried that liberal principles would ultimately undermine liberal goals. Consequently they advocated a postliberal order” (1996, xi).<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: hsns.2012.42.issue-5<br>
Date: 11 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay brings together and builds upon histories of cold war American science and studies of objectivity, scientific personae, and the self by exploring the physicist Merle A. Tuve‘s career in the late 1940s and 1950s as a history of selfhood and the emotional dimensions of scientific identity. As director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington after World War II, Tuve followed a convoluted path through the institutions, politics, identities, and sensibilities of science in the cold war, and he struggled to preserve a sense of meaning and identity centered on the humanistic and aesthetic possibilities of scientific inquiry in an era of rapidly growing instrumentalism. His predicament highlights not just the political and institutional shifts within postwar science, but also the intricate entanglements between feeling, selfhood, and the cold war order.<br>

Article Title: Is Culture a Problem for Social Psychology?<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: irqr.2008.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 05 2008<br>
Abstract: Culture has been regarded as an anathema to psychology as an empiricist research tradition. Despite the explosive growth of research on culture and psychology over the last decade of the 20
         thcentury and its importance in Asian social psychology, the ontological and epistemological tension between psychology as a science and psychology as a cultural/historical discipline introduced in the writings of the thinkers of the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment still lingers on in the contemporary discourse of psychology. Clifford Geertz once ominously suggested that cultural psychology may have chewed more than it can. In this paper, the interpretive turn in social science as exemplified by writings of Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur is reviewed and discussed how it may impinge on the practice of Asian social psychology as an empirical science in methodological, epistemological, and ontological respects. It is argued here that the current practice of Asian social psychology is largely, though not entirely, free of the challenges mounted by these theorists, and that Asian social psychology has an advantage of not encumbered by this traditional tension due to a monist ontology that is prevalent in Asia.<br>

Article Title: Religion and the Social Sciences: Conflict or Reconciliation?<br>
Publisher: Society for the Scientific Study of Religion<br>
Issue: i259940<br>
Date: 9 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Wallace William C.<br>
Abstract: I offer an account of Weston La Barre's The Ghost Dance to indicate the continuing vitality of a Freudian ideological attack on religious beliefs and behavior. A contemporary group of social scientists, chiefly featuring Bellah, Geertz, and Luckmann, could possibly meet La Barre's sociopsychiatric challenge to religion. I examine their reliance on functional definitions of religion as a conciliatory measure designed to overcome the conflict between religious belief and the social scientific study of religion. Despite certain logical and empirical problems in the use of functional definitions of religion, I conclude that theoretical advances have been achieved in their writings. But in a more philosophical context, which is where La Barre's analysis really belongs, I suggest that their positions are logically insufficient as a rejoinder. The bridge between religion and social science, therefore, may yet contain some shaky girders.<br>

Abstract: If the arguments of Edward Said's "Orientalism" are valid, Joseph Needham's "Science and Civilisation in China" stands condemned. The opposition between Foucault, Said's main source of inspiration, and both Marxism and hermeneutics is highlighted. Utilizing the work of MacIntyre, recent hermeneutic philosophy is defended against Foucault, and through this, Needham's work is defended as a form of Marxist hermeneutics.<br>

Author(s): Gadamer Eugenia Victoria<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the perception of space through both visual and haptic systems of perception and examines the resultant impact on the process of spatial visualization. The development of technology from science as magic to science as information is used as a framework to (re)discover relationships between (1) the perception of space and the tools of visualization and (2) their effects on architectural education.<br>

Article Title: Jonathan Edwards and the Language of God<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263722<br>
Date: 12 1, 1960<br>
Author(s): Edwards William J.<br>
Abstract: Part 1 shows that while Edwards and Berkeley both regard nature as God's discourse and speak of this discourse in similar ways, Edwards differs from Berkeley in believing that the signs of this discourse signify spiritual and divine realities. Part 2 explains why Edwards thought it reasonable to believe that our world is a world of types and images. Because our world is a world of resemblances and imitations, because spiritual things are its "alpha and omega," and because its beauty is a reflection of God's beauty, our world can be expected to contain images or shadows of divine things. Scripture provides evidence that this expectation is realized. Part 3 shows that these images are not symbols but emblems, and that because emblems are consciously invented, their occurrence implies theism. Part 4 attempts to show that, given the assumptions of classical Christian theism, it is in principle no more difficult to decipher the meaning of the book of nature than to decipher the meaning of an allegorical poem or tale. Part 5 criticizes Perry Miller. Edwards's reflections on types were not influenced by the new science. He did not anticipate Coleridge on the imagination, nor did he "elevate nature to a level of authority coequal with revelation."<br>

Author(s): Llosa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the tw~<br>

Publisher: Philosophy of Science Association<br>
Issue: i302046<br>

Author(s): Wartofsky Patrick<br>
Abstract: The author proposes the thesis that all perception, including observation in natural science, is hermeneutical as well as causal; that is, the perceiver (or observer) learns to 'read' instrumental or other perceptual stimuli as one learns to read a text. This hermeneutical aspect at the heart of natural science is located where it might be least expected, within acts of scientific observation. In relation to the history of science, the question is addressed to what extent the hermeneutical component within scientific observation opens natural science to the charge of reflecting merely cultural values, and of providing merely a culturally acceptable reading of the "Book of Nature", rather than, as the author states, one stating universal antecedent conditions of possibility of cultural activity itself.<br>

Author(s): Wheelwright Eugene F.<br>
Abstract: Since the language of political inquiry seems to be inescapably metaphorical, the question necessarily arises as to how metaphors of various types, including models, enter into the composition and expression of political knowledge. The solutions that have been most influential in contemporary political science can be called the verificationist and constitutivist views of political metaphor. While both views contain important elements of truth, there are fundamental difficulties in each that require the search for a more satisfactory view. An alternative view of metaphor and political knowledge is developed by reference to four main problems: Why is political speech metaphorical? How do metaphors make political things manifest? How are political metaphors tested? and Are metaphors indispensable to political expression and political knowledge?<br>

Author(s): Skinner John G.<br>
Abstract: Recent challenges to traditional approaches and purposes for studying the history of political theory have raised questions about its constitution as both a subject matter and subfield of political science. Methodological arguments advocating what is characterized as a more truly historical mode of inquiry for understanding political ideas and recovering textual meaning have become increasingly popular. The relationship of these hermeneutical claims about historicity, such as that advanced by Quentin Skinner, to the actual practice of interpretation is problematical. Such claims are more a defense of a certain norm of historical investigation than a method of interpretation, and the implications of this norm for the reconstitution of the history of political theory require careful consideration.<br>

Author(s): Tinder Deborah<br>
Abstract: The phrasing of the title telegraphs the thesis of this essay: study of the history of political theory ought to be understood and approached as a branch of political studies. Prior to the postwar success of empirical political science, the view would have seemed unexceptional. But the need for a defense against the empiricist attack impelled many theorists to turn to theories of interpretation in search of a philosophical and methodological identity. A preoccupation with issues of interpretation now threatens the customary, political study of the tradition. This essay, written in defense of a political understanding of the field, identifies fundamental propositions distinguishing @`political commentary@' and suggests critical standards appropriate to the enterprise. It also criticizes two currently fashionable applications of interpretative theory to the study of politics, historicist commentary and hermeneutical political science.<br>

Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Article Title: The Theory of International Politics? An Analysis of Neorealist Theory<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>

Abstract: In recent years a number of writers have defended and attacked various features of structural, or neo-realist theories of international politics. Few, however, have quarrelled with one of the most foundational features of neorealist theory: its assumptions about the nature of science and scientific theories. In this essay I assess the views of science underlying much neorelist theory, especially as they are articulated in the work of Kenneth Waltz. I argue not only that neorealist theories rest on assumptions about science and theory that have been questioned by postpositivist philosophers and historians of science, but also that the failure to consider the work of these writers yields theories of international politics that are deficient in several respects: they are "weak" theories in the sense that they cannot illuminate crucial features of international politics, they presuppose and sustain a narrow view of power and power relations, they reify practices and relations in the international arena and they offer little promise of producing the sort of "Copernican Revolution" for which Waltz called (or, more modestly, even a minimally satisfactory theory of international politics). In light of these shortcomings, I sketch an alternative approach to the study of international affairs, one that has been termed "prototype studies." I contend that such an approach provides scholars with a rigorous way of studying international politics, without being a theoretical science.<br>

Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: i308701<br>
Date: 7 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Dittmer Lowell<br>
Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Author(s): Schulkin Jay<br>
Abstract: Two philosophical traditions with much in common, (classical) pragmatism and (Heidegger's) hermeneutic philosophy, are here compared with respect to their approach to the philosophy of science. Both emphasize action as a mode of interpreting experience. Both have developed important categories -- inquiry, meaning, theory, praxis, coping, historicity, life-world -- and each has offered an alternative to the more traditional philosophies of science stemming from Descartes, Hume, and Comte. Pragmatism's "abduction" works with the dual perspectives of theory (as explanation) and praxis (as culture). The hermeneutical circle depends in addition on the lifeworld as background source of ontological meaning and resource for strategies of inquiry. Thus a hermeneutical philosophy of research involves three components: lifeworld (as ontological and strategic), theory (as explanatory), and praxis (as constitutive of culture).<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i20446751<br>
Date: 9 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Kedar Asaf<br>
Abstract: This article offers an anti-naturalist philosophical critique of the naturalist tendencies within qualitative concept formation as developed most prominently by Giovanni Sartori and David Collier. We begin by articulating the philosophical distinction between naturalism and anti-naturalism. Whereas naturalism assumes that the study of human life is not essentially different from the study of natural phenomena, anti-naturalism highlights the meaningful and contingent nature of social life, the situatedness of the scholar, and so the dialogical nature of social science. These two contrasting philosophical approaches inspire, in turn, different strategies of concept formation. Naturalism encourages concept formation that involves reification, essentialism, and an instrumentalist view of language. Anti-naturalism, conversely, challenges reified concepts for eliding the place of meanings, essentialist concepts for eliding the place of contingency, and linguistic instrumentalism for eliding the situatedness of the scholar and the dialogical nature of social science. Based on this philosophical framework, we subject qualitative concept formation to a philosophical critique. We show how the conceptual strategies developed by Sartori and Collier embody a reification, essentialism, and instrumentalist view of language associated with naturalism. Although Collier's work on concept formation is much more flexible and nuanced than Sartori's, it too remains attached to a discredited naturalism.<br>

Abstract: En réaction à la double abstraction manifestée par la traditionnelle histoire des idées et par le structuralisme, l'histoire des intellectuels, à la fin des années 1980, a développé un programme de micro histoire sociale de la vie intellectuelle saisie à travers ses cadres concrets de fonctionnement tels les revues, les maisons d'éditions et les cercles de la sociabilité intellectuelle. Cette histoire culturelle des idées, attentive aux données impliquées par la transmission et la circulation des idées, a cependant délaissé l'examen des réalités langagières. Examiner comment le langage des œuvres modifie l'expérience des acteurs historiques reste un salutaire défi pour l'historien de la culture. Via l'étude des mécanismes de réception des œuvres, à travers celle des controverses, ou par le biais de la construction adéquate du contexte où joue la dialectique des faits moraux et sociaux, l'historien culturel, au carrefour de diverses disciplines voisines (histoire littéraire, sociologie des sciences, histoire conceptuelle du politique) s'inscrit au cœur des sciences humaines. /// Against the double abstraction shown by the traditional history of ideas and by structuralism, the history of intellectuals, at the end of the 1980s, developed a micro social history program of intellectual life seen through the study of journals, publishing houses and intellectual circles. This cultural history of ideas, attentive to the circulation and transmission of ideas, has nevertheless ignored the question of linguistic realities. Examining how the language of intellectual works modifies the experience of historical actors is a good challenge for the cultural historian. Through the study of how works are received, of the controversies, or through the appropriate construction of the context with the dialectical play of moral and social facts, the cultural historian, at the intersection of various related disciplines (literary history, sociology of science, conceptual history of politic~<br>

Abstract: The introduction to the symposium sets out a methodological framework for the apprehension of Southeast Asian rituals, languages, and literary texts so that they are at once open to cross-cultural comparative analysis and recorded in social and symbolic contextual detail. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur's use of the term "interpretation" is central here: he urges students of cultures to combine attention to structural features of language and culture (for example, grammatical patterns) with inquiries into social contextual features (for example, speech usage in real communities). Moving back and forth between the two sorts of analysis allows researchers to bring the insights of the one pole to the investigation of the other; the full hermeneutic process constitutes interpretation. This style of inquiry, a modification of the sort of interpretive social science developed by Geertz and Becker, allows Southeast Asianists to draw on careful ethnography to make crucial "course corrections" in anthropological and linguistic theory building in general.<br>

Abstract: È curioso quanto Albert Schinz dice a questo proposito nel suo Etat présent des tra-
vaux sur Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Egli infatti attribuiva al suo lavoro La Pensée de Rous-
seau (Paris, A. Colin, 1929, in particolare aile pagine 158-196) il merito di aver ricono-
sciuto che Rousseau non considera lo stato di natura come la condizione piú felice per
gli uomini. Quindi, orgoglioso, affermava che «cette nouvelle interprétation de Rousseau
fît son chemin». Negli Stati Uniti Tavrebbe ripresa Lovejoy, nel suo saggio sui «suppo-
sto primitivismo» «arretant brusquement les campagnes anti-rousseauistes violentes qui
reposaient entièrement sur le grief d'exalter l'homme de nature» (Etat présent, cit., p.
185). Schinz datava lo studio di Lovejoy al 1933. Peccato che questi lo avesse scritto nel
1923, quindi sei anni prima rispetto a La Pensée de Rousseau, che è del 1929. L'inter-
pretazione che rigettava il «primitivismo» rousseauiano era già stata avanzata anche pri-
ma del saggio di Lovejoy. Era presente, per esempio, in un articolo di J. Izoulet sulla
«Revue Hebdomadaire» del gennaio 1909, dove l'autore faceva notare che i caratteri at-
tribuiti da Rousseau all'uomo primitivo nel secondo Discours erano quelli dell'animalità
pura, e non di un essere propriamente umano; e in E. Champion, J.-J. Rousseau et la
Révolution française, Paris, A. Colin, 1910, dove a p. 51 si diceva: «son éloge de l'état
de nature est une satire presque aussi sombre que celle qu'il fait de l'état social: l'hom-
me sauvage n'a pas de vices, mais pas davantage de vertus; ni bon, ni mauvais; il est
nul, il est bête, ne pense, n'aime, ni hait, n'a ni droits, ni devoirs». Dopo l'ardeolo di
Lovejoy, negli Stati Uniti, questa interpretazione fu ripresa dall'importante studio di E.H.
Wright, The Meaning of Rousseau, London-New York, Oxford University Press, 1929;
e da S.V. Ogden, in un articolo apparso nell'«American Political Science Review», Au-
gust 1938, pp. 643-656.<br>

Publisher: M. E. Sharpe<br>
Issue: i20628279<br>

Author(s): Kosicki Piotr H.<br>
Abstract: Beginning with Maurice Halbwachs's theory of collective memory and the great body of sociological, historical, and political-science literature on war and aggression that postdates Halbwachs, the author attempts to identify the elements of aggressor—victim memory through a detailed analysis of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In participant and third-party narratives of the genocide, it is possible to observe a commemorative quality in the campaign of mass murder. The author suggests that the persistence of post-traumatic culture and the failure of dialogue can lead people to kill in remembrance of earlier aggression: in such cases, "acting out" substitutes for "working through," with horrifying consequences.<br>

Issue: i20630137<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between the new comparative theology and the theology of religions in light of their common genealogy in the comparative theology of the late nineteenth century. Noting that the latter's blindness to its considerable biases was sustained by its oppositional relationship with the exclusionary apologetic theology of the day, the paper argues that the new comparative theology risks repeating the same pattern of self-deception when it dichotomizes its relationship with the theology of religions. At the same time, however, the new comparative theology, by openly acknowledging its theological commitments, strips the comparative method of the aura of "science" which has often functioned ideologically to mask bias. In this way, the new comparative theology exemplifies the recent shift in the understanding of comparison from a method of discovery to a critical method for the testing and revision of the categories through which scholars interpret their data.<br>

Article Title: The Making of a Social Theory: Anthony Giddens' Theory of Structuration<br>
Publisher: North Central Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i20831390<br>
Date: 4 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Dickie-Clark Hamish F.<br>
Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Abstract: In sociohistorical inquiry, no epistemology prevails as a widely accepted account of knowledge. Positivism yet retains its defenders. As alternatives, both structuralist and hermeneutic challenges to science are undermined as foundations of knowledge by their own accounts, yielding the postmodern loss of certitude. Conventionalism, rationalism, and realism have been proposed as "local epistemologies" under the new conditions, and on a broader level, pragmatic and transcendental theories of communication substitute for epistemology classically conceived. As yet, these contending developments do not resolve the crisis of sociohistorical knowledge.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i310502<br>
Date: 2 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Kritzer Herbert M.<br>
Abstract: Interpretation is central to the social scientist's process of analysis, regardless of whether that analysis relies on quantitative or qualitative data. This essay presents a "reconstructed logic" of the interpretation process involved in quantitative data analysis. Drawing upon a broad literature on interpretation, the paper shows how the interpretive processes for quantitative "data" has significant similarities to interpretation in other settings. For example, both qualitative textual analysis and quantitative statistical analysis rely upon contextual and topological paradigms, although the specific conventions differ in many respects. The process of play employed by musicians and actors in developing an interpretation of a piece of music or a dramatic role suggests ways in which the quantitative analyst might let data perform to help in arriving at appropriate interpretations of statistical results. The lines between quantitative and qualitative social science are less clear than often presumed. Both types of analysis involve extensive interpretation, and tools of interpretation that have many fundamental similarities.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has initiated a new direction in the field of hermeneutics by applying the phenomenological method to the interpretation of texts. By this he has effected a transition from description to hermeneutic phenomenology. In order to explicate his position the paper deals with this transformation: In developing hermeneutics Ricoeur tends to eliminate Husserl's transcendental idealism, to retain some central phenomenological motifs, and to add new elements. These elements were eclectically picked up by him from analytic and linguistic philosophy and from the current linguistic and structural theories. Since the deepest and most genuine roots of Ricoeur's thought lie in the phenomenology of Husserl, the paper concentrates on the explication of his phenomenological presuppositions and attempts to show how they were reformulated within the new science of interpretation. Thus, the first part of the paper is mainly an exposition of the transition from phenomenology to hermeneutics. The second part points to some difficulties inherent in such a move. The paper ends with a discussion of the problem of "the hermeneutic circle", which is an immanent part of hermeneutics.<br>

Article Title: La précaution comme souci<br>
Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i23353270<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Guery François<br>
Abstract: La précaution a été critiquée non en elle-même, mais comme « principe », à la fois sur le plan juridique et scientifique. Les formulations du principe prêtaient à confusion, à cause du jargon « scientifique » utilisé (cf. absence de preuves, de « certitudes scientifiques »). Liée à l'urgence, la précaution ressortit à une philosophie de l'agir, qui comporte menace, vulnérabilité, anticipation, appréhension, et c'est de ce côté qu'il faut chercher la logique de la précaution. En premier lieu, une « déduction sémantique a priori » (Derrida) permet de mettre en évidence les caractéristiques de la peur, qui justifie la précaution. En second lieu, un rappel de la tradition philosophique confirme cette déduction, rappel qui va d'Aristote (Rhétorique : ce qu'est la peur et comment on est quand on l'éprouve; Éthique à Nicomaque : le courage, l'intrépidité, la disposition acquise) à Heidegger (Être et Temps : la peur comme disposition insigne, esquisse de l'angoisse, du souci, de la responsabilité, de la résolution), en passant par des étapes essentielles : Augustin (la cura, la curiosité), Kant (derniers écrits), Nietzsche (Seconde Inactuelle). Enfin, et en conclusion, la précaution apparaît non comme une démission de la connaissance, mais comme une incitation à mieux scénariser, à mieux gérer l'avenir, en cultivant une imagination anticipative, complémentaire de l'innovation. If Precaution has been criticized, on both a legal and a scientific level, it is not as an approach in itself but as a Principle. The way the Precautionary Principle has been formulated was confusing, jargonistic : lack of proof, of scientific certainty. Linked as it is to the notion of Emergency, Precaution is part of an Acting Philosophy which includes Threat, Vulnerability, Anticipation and Apprehension; its logic is to be found therein. Firstly, a « semantic deduction a priori » (Derrida) will help to define the characteristics of Fear, which justifies Precaution. Secondly, we shall confirm this d~<br>

Publisher: The University of Nebraska Press<br>
Issue: i23535704<br>
Date: 7 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Grossman Kathryn M.<br>
Abstract: Set in the exiled poet's "marginal" home in the Channel Islands, Les Travailleurs de la mer (1866) elaborates a vision of creative potential. Science, dreams, meditation, natural forces, physical prowess, selfess devotion, even death—all serve as vehicles for expanding the boundaries of our universe, both internal and external. The protagonist, Gilliatt, avails himself of these multiple modes of transport to challenge our notion of the humanly—and inhumanly—possible. Transcending his own limits to conquer a wide array of "monsters," he links the motifs of movement and displacement in Hugo's hypertropic narrative to the transpositions of metaphor, the sublime, and political exile.<br>

Abstract: "Teaching" and "science" are notions that cannot be applied univocally to theology. Teaching implies that the mind masters its object scientifically through human methods; but who can master the knowledge which God alone possesses? There is need for God's Word himself to become Teacher (John 1,18). Thus, in the schools the sacra pagina will open itself up to become sacra doctrina. The method of theology is therefore always subordinate to a transcendent knowledge which finally remains inaccessible to any merely human science. Is science thereby degraded or on the contrary enhanced? Thomas Aquinas developed the idea of «subalternation». Blondel spoke of a science based on Christ «verified and realised in us». Today hermeneutics discovers that only the Glory of ultimate reality is capable of giving meaning to all the figures that announce it in human history and knowledge. On the other hand, the avatars of nominalism show that reducing theology and science to univocity results in perverting science as such.<br>

Author(s): SIMON Anne<br>
Abstract: Cet article traite d'une part de la question de l'intersubjectivité — au sens merleau-pontien — dans le processus de la recherche, d'autre part des relations entre critique littéraire et histoire des sciences et des idées. L'examen de ma dette intellectuelle envers Gérard Simon conduira à l'analyse de la question de l'optique chez Marcel Proust, et tout particulièrement au décryptage des rapports, à première vue dépassés à son époque, qu'il établit entre regard et rayon visuel. The first part of this article deals with intersubjectivity and how I became interested in research from a Merleau-Pontian point of view. Part two explores the relationship between literary studies and the history of science and ideas. Indeed, I shall analyze the intellectual influence Gérard Simon had on my work, which then led me to a study of optics in Marcel Proust. I focus on the boundaries he draws between sight and visual ray, a distinction which, on a surface level, might appear to be outdated in his time.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: Language and judicial activities are both signs of the existence of a society. There is, therefore, good reason for a dialogue between the science of language and the science of law. This article applies a linguistic theory of the Paris School (semiotics) to the examination of a legal text, namely a contract. The author points to some elements shared by legal and other texts, and demonstrates how a semiotic interpretation can provide interesting and unexpected insights into the deeper levels of a legal text.

Abstract: The paper offers a new model of genre. The model employs Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of plane of immanence, chaos, and, in particular, concepts and approaches of cognitive science. Genre in general and the film genre in particular are modelled as a multidimensional space with a network of vector sequences, as a plane of immanence with individual works in the role of concepts, as a cluster category without a centre. That genre model provides more explanatory power than the recent semantic-syntactical one.<br>

Article Title: SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE VERY IDEA OF OTHERNESS<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922199<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Morgan Ben<br>
Abstract: The article uses a reading of Eliot's Middlemarch and a discussion of Levinas and Heidegger to challenge two aspects of the approach to literary texts proposed by Toril Moi. I suggest that we needn't assume that the inner lives of others are inaccessible in the way Moi (following Stanley Cavell) does, nor that literature has a privileged role in helping us come to terms with this alterity. Literature is one practice amongst others with which relations with other people are negotiated more or less honestly. I argue that recent developments in phenomenology and cognitive science, in particular the focus on enactive and participatory models of being in the world, can help to make more concrete Heidegger's concept of being-with (Mitsein) and Levinas' concept of proximité. Heidegger and Levinas' can then take their place in a counter tradition of 20th-century thinkers who engage with human togetherness rather than declare it to be impossible. The question Heidegger and Levinas' raise about the ethical challenge of human togetherness is not, however, answered by more recent research. It is by turning back to Middlemarch and viewing it in the context of its original marketing that we can see one way that this challenge may be confronted in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: This article presents critical psychology in some new light. First, it presents the history of US critical psychology in terms of the overall foundation of its critique (identity-based, ideologically-based, and epistemologically-based). Second, it broadens the population that can be called critical psychologists. The argument is made to include: (1) philosophers of language, science, and mind critical of psychology's foundational assumptions, conceptions, and methods of inquiry; and (2) non-professional, ordinary people who live their lives critical of psychology by eschewing mainstream approaches and taking alternative routes to getting help with their emotional and physical pain, or the education of their children. Third, the article discusses ontology-based critique through the example of the practical-critical theory/practice of social therapy.<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Author(s): Bégout Bruce<br>
Abstract: Ce n'est pas le lieu ici de discuter de cette interprétation générale (que l'on retrouve, avec
certaines nuances idiosyncrasiques, dans les lectures de Husserl faites par Heidegger, Patocka,
Henry, Merleau-Ponty, Marion, etc.). Ce qui est sûr, c'est que si l'on observe la naissance histo-
rique de la phénoménologie comme méthode et réflexion dans les Recherches logiques de 1901,
il nous semble difficile de séparer, comme deux corps distincts et étrangers l'un à l'autre, d'un
côté la phénoménologie comme méthode descriptive des phénomènes et de leurs conditions de
phénoménalisation, et de l'autre le programme philosophique d'une doctrine de la science
réflexive et fondative. Il y a, selon nous, chez Husserl une intrication originelle entre l'analyse
de la phénoménalité et la visée gnoséologique. Le gnoséologique (la théorie de la connaissance)
se fonde sur le phénoménologique (d'où la promotion des vécus internes de la conscience qui
possèdent une teneur de vérité plus grande, une cognoscibilité plus assurée), de même que le
phénoménologique se fonde sur le gnoséologique (l'analyse de la phénoménalité des phéno-
mènes ayant toujours pour but de décider de leur sens et de leur validité).<br>

Elle est, face aux secrets matériels que la science tente de percer, celle qui gère tous ces autres secrets dans lesquels nous sommes impliqués – pris et piégés. » Salah Stétié fait suivre cet article d'un poème dédié à Paul Ricœur, « L'insaisi ».<br>

Abstract: Este artigo contém uma leitura em contraponto: a noção de situação em Simone de Beauvoir e a de intersecções em Donna Haraway expressariam supostos relacionais; mulher estaria para Beauvoir como ciborgue está para Haraway; Beauvoir distingue a situação das mulheres, dos judeus e dos negros, considerando a relação entre situações e consciências históricas e|ou biológicas. A biologia aparece em situação como construção mítica de uma identidade a ser ultrapassada para a constituição do sujeito; em Haraway, o ciborgue seria uma narrativa sobre como o biológico e a realidade social de raça e gênero situam-se em uma rede de interações, informação e semiologia. Relação e constituição do "objeto", temas caros à teoria social, seriam instituídos em (e pela) alteridade sem a dicotomia dura entre realidade e ficção, natureza e cultura, literatura e ciência. In this article I will present a counterpoint between notions of 'situation' by Simone de Beauvoir and 'intersections' by Donna Haraway, which express ideas of relation. I will argue that woman for Beauvoir is like cyborg for Haraway. Beauvoir distinguishes the situation of women, Jews and blacks by considering the relationship between situations and historical consciousness and | or biological weapons. For Beauvoir, the biology in situation appears as construction of a mythical identity to be overcome for the formation of the subject. Alternatively, Haraway uses the cyborg as a narrative of how the biological and social reality of race and gender are into a network of interactions, information and semiology. With this claiming for alterity inside the relation and constitution of the "object", both authors bring important challenges to two of the most important issues of social theory. Moreover, they do it without the hard dichotomy between reality and fiction, nature and culture, literature and science.<br>

Abstract: Before any significant attempt is made to read Negro-African history, the first task is to conquer its field of research. The critical works of Frobenius, Westermann and Bauman, Delafosse, Homburger, Murdock, Leakey and Cheikh Anta Diop provide us with appropriate means of investigation (which still require to be refined) in order to obtain a profound, inner knowledge of the Negro-African social tradition. Prehistory must become a major science in the teaching profession — especially in Africa — because it offers man a general outline of the first consequences of his past before the appearance of writing. No Africanist or African historian can allow himself to by-pass this branch of study. The same applies to Egyptology and to African linguistics, sociology and ethnology. Diop has used the last three sciences to retrace the migrations of African peoples, to establish their cultural unity and to rediscover the continuity of Negro-African history. The study of African, Greco-Roman, Arab and European documents (whether oral or written, archaeological, linguistic or sociological) gives us information concerning the appearance of homo faber in Africa about 5,500,000 years ago, the Egypto-Nubian civilizations, the African Neolithic worlds, pre-colonial Africa, the Arab invasions, the slave-trade, colonization and the present-day national liberation struggles and the formation of new States. The African cultural world has its roots in the Tertiary Period and it is beyond doubt that the biological substratum of humanity is Negro or Negroïd (C.A. Diop and the discovery of Asselar Man by the Augiéras-Draper Saharan expedition in December 1927), that Negroes were in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic periods and helped in the formation of today's Europoïd races. The author uses the social structures of the Pharaonic Ancient Empire (2778 - 2423 B. C.) as models to describe the history of Negro-African societies in their ensemble and contrasts the former with thos~<br>

Abstract: Genocide is a political catastrophe. Yet it has not received much academic attention. A few social scientists have studied it. Philosophers have largely ignored it. There is a large literature on the Holocaust, but there is little agreement as to how this should be related to other genocides. Some have argued that the Holocaust represented a crisis of Western culture, but that Western culture has not responded adequately for the lack of the appropriate self-understanding. This crisis has been attributed to the predominance of scientistic models of rationality in our culture. Social-scientific approaches to genocide have been criticised because of their commitment to logical empiricism, which is held to be epistemologically and ethically inadequate. Ethical approaches based on liberal humanism have been criticised by post-Nietzschean philosophers for their attachment to allegedly outworn metaphysical assumptions. However, the deconstruction of social science and liberal ethics leads in the direction of relativism and nihilism, which are either useless or dangerous in the face of evils such as genocide. The arguments against conventional social science and ethics are examined, and a counter-critique made of post-modern philosophy in order to clear the ground for constructive thinking about genocide.<br>

Abstract: A. Fouillée, La psychologie des Idées-Forces (2 vols.), Paris 1894, Bd.I,

tantôt à l'état naissant, tantôt plus ou moins complète, qui se révèle à elle-même
dans la conscience par un sentiment spécial, et ce sentiment spécial fait le fond de la
reconnaissance. D'autre part l'habitude est une adaptation au milieu, selon la
grande loi de sélection universelle; c'est l'adaptation de la puissance à la
résistance, de l'activité à son objet. Reconnaître, c'est donc avant tout avoir con-
science d'agir avec une moindre résistance. Mais, pour que l'habitude aussi formée
devienne consciente de soi, il faut que nous puissions apercevoir tout ensemble la
différence et la ressemblance du nouveau avec l'ancien, de l'accoutumé avec le
familier. Reconnaître, c'est donc saisir à la fois des différences et des ressemblances,
saisir des rapports, comparer (S. 242).<br>

sind die ersten Ergebnisse bereits erschienen. Diese grundlegende Arbeit wird die philo-
sophische Begriffsgeschichte der frühen Neuzeit in ein neues Licht stellen. Bisher sind folgende

Abstract: Der Horizont der Vergangenheit bildet nicht den Horizont an sich, wie das historische Be-
wußtsein ihn meint, sondern den vom Interpreten entworfenen Horizont. Gadamer anerkennt
die Bemühung um den Entwurf des historischen Horizontes. Der Interpret ist jedoch geschicht-
lich, so daß der Horizont derselben historischen Zeit, je nach dem Zeitalter des Interpreten, an-
ders entworfen werden muß. In Wirklichkeit gibt es allerdings viele hermeneutische Literatur, die
vom historischen Horizont spricht, als ob es ein objektiv und eindeutig zu bestimmender Hori-
zont wäre. So ζ. B. Wolfgang Pannenberg: Hermeneutik und Universalgeschichte. In: Zeit-
schrift für Theologie und Kirche. Bd. 60 (1963) S. 90—121, hier S. 116. Yoshio Hirako: Gadamä
to Gendai-shi [Gadamer und gegenwärtige Gedichte]. In: Doitsu Bungaku [Deutsche Literatur]
Nr. 60 (1981) S. 33-44, hier S. 35. Ken AsO, a. a. O. (Anm. 31) S. 210. Eric Donald Hirsch
Jr: Validity in Interpretation (New Häven 1967) p. 254. - Hirschs Hermeneutik, die im oben ge-
nannten Buch entfaltet wird, ist das genaue Gegenbild zu Gadamers Hermeneutik. Hirsch sagt,
daß der mit dem Gegenwartshorizont zu verschmelzende historische Horizont im voraus be-
stimmt werden müsse, damit die Horizontverschmelzung möglich sei. Der Textsinn selbst müsse
zunächst aufgefaßt und dann die Bedeutung zur Sprache gebracht werden, die der Textsinn für
den Leser hat. Dagegen lehnt Gadamer vom Standpunkt der geschichtlichen Endlichkeit des
Menschen aus den Dogmatismus von „Sinn an sich" ab (477) und stellt die Unterscheidung von
Sinn und Bedeutung in Frage. Hirsch versteht wegen seiner eigenen hermeneutischen Stellung
nicht, daß der historische Horizont es ist, der in der Erweiterung des Gegenwartshorizonts provi-
sorisch entworfen und am Ende des Verstehens aufgegeben wird. Vgl. Joseph J. Kockelmans:

Abstract: Public administration is inherently an interdisciplinary field, prominently incorporating theory and methods from economics, political science, and sociology. Less obviously, however, MPA curricula include historical treatments of particular policy arenas, institutions, the administrative state, and the professions of policy analyst and public management. In addition, the case method that figures prominently in MPA pedagogy and the research MPA students perform depend on doing history. Yet, history as a scholarly endeavor is rarely included in basic courses, much less instruction in research methods. This essay explores the use of history in MPA curricula and how MPA students might acquire a deeper appreciation of history and how historians ply their craft.<br>

Abstract: Encroachments of contemporary social theory on the field of theology are the focal point of this essay. In postmodernity, theology facilitates connections with social theory. In the domain of theology, sociocultural problems are being presented as theological issues. Secularized variants of world theology meet with theologizing postsecular social theory above and beyond sociology. This is facilitated by the constant discourse of ambiguity. In this discourse, "the theological" is a vehicle of indeterminate meanings. Praxis' oriented discourse uses the term "social theory" with its modernist connotative envelope of science and rationality, but with no obligation whatsoever to maintain objectivity of cognition. Sociology doesn't interfere with theological discourse, but may analyze it, leaving the otherworldly outside its perspective on sociocultural phenomena. The sociotheological discourse of ambiguity, however, opposes both religion and the rationality of science.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i24441733<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): VIDAL CLÉMENT<br>
Abstract: Philosophy lacks criteria to evaluate its philosophical theories. To fill this gap, this essay introduces nine criteria to compare worldviews, classified in three broad categories: objective criteria (objective consistency, scientificity, scope), subjective criteria (subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality), and intersubjective criteria (intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity). The essay first defines what a worldview is and exposes the heuristic used in the quest for criteria. After describing each criterion individually, it shows what happens when each of them is violated. From the criteria, it derives assessment tests to compare and improve different worldviews. These include the is-ought, ought-act, and is-act first-order tests; the critical and dialectical second-order tests; the mixed-questions and first-second-order third-order tests; and the we-I, we-it, and it-I tests. The essay then applies these criteria and tests to a concrete example, comparing the Flying Spaghetti Monster deity with Intelligent Design. For another application, it draws more general fruitful suggestions for the dialogue between science and religion.<br>

Abstract: All humans by nature desire to know and humans are distinguished from the rest of creation by the miracle of knowledge. If all cultures have developed their own forms of knowledge, the spectacular success of a certain form of knowledge, science, notably in the west, has frequently led to its being exclusively attributed to the west. Yet science remains only one of many forms of knowledge and the west only one of its producers. The success of the west has tended to marginalize other forms of knowledge and other contributions to knowledge and, thus to impoverish an otherwise potentially rich and complex world knowledge landscape. It has tended to inhibit or even prevent the development of a really universal, human-knowledge project. Its very success, due essentially to its sustained application to technology, has enabled the development of a false superiority over other forms of knowledge and a real power hegemony of the west over other peoples. The future of lasting peaceful co-existence in the world may depend, in part, on the emancipation of other knowledge modes and forms. De par leur nature, tous les êtres humains éprouvent le désir de savoir, et les humains se distinguent des autres êtres de la Création par le miracle de la connaissance. Bien que toutes les cultures aient développé leurs propres formes de connaissance, le succès spectaculaire, notamment en Europe, d'une forme particulière de la connaissance, la science, a fait que cette dernière a été exclusivement attribuée à l'Occident. Pourtant, la science ne représente qu'une des nombreuses formes de la connaissance et l'Occident n'est qu'un producteur de celle-ci, parmi tant d'autres. Le succès de l'Occident a contribué à marginaliser les autres formes de connaissance et autres contributions à la connaissance, et ainsi, a fini par appauvrir le paysage international de la connaissance, qui autrement, aurait pu être extrêmement riche et diversifié. Ce succès de l'Occident a fini par inhiber, voire empêcher le~<br>

Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Gordon Lewis R.<br>
Abstract: In celebration of the fortieth anniversary of CODESRIA, an institution from the Global South devoted to taking responsibility for the production of social science knowledge, this article explores what it means to pursue such a task under the threat of colonial imposition at methodological and disciplinary levels, which, the author argues, carries dangers of disciplinary decadence marked by the fetishisation of method. The author offers alternatives through what he calls 'a teleological suspension' of disciplinarity, and raises the question not only of the decolonisation of knowledge but also norms. Pour célébrer le quarantième anniversaire du CODESRIA, une institution des pays du Sud dévouée dans la production de connaissances en sciences sociales, cet article explore les implications de mener une telle tâche sous la menace de l'emprise coloniale à des niveaux méthodologiques et disciplinaires, qui, selon l'auteur, provoque des dangers sur la décadence disciplinaire marquée par la divination de la méthode. L'auteur propose des alternatives à travers ce qu'il appelle « une suspension téléologique » de l'interdisciplinarité, et pose la question non seulement de la décolonisation de la connaissance, mais aussi celle des normes.<br>

Abstract: Il convient de caractériser, ne serait-ce que brièvement, ladite science officielle. Tout d'abord, la démoscopie sta-
tique prédominait dans la sociologie; ensuite, parmi les thèmes privilégiés, on trouvait la sociologie du temps libre,
les attitudes envers les valeurs, la sociologie des petits groupes, la sociologie du travail; enfin, l'optique de la
recherche était systématiquement définie à l'avance. Beaucoup d'ouvrages de l'époque sont ainsi consacrés au
« rapprochement entre la ville et la campagne », à la « la disparition des survivances religieuses », au « rapport socia-
liste vis-à-vis du travail et de la mobilité indésirable d'employés », etc.. L'ethnographie était fortement orientée vers
l'histoire. Elle étudiait la « culture populaire » à partir des artefacts conservés provenant pour la plupart de la fin du
XIXe siècle. Dans l'esprit de la théorie évolutionniste, on faisait des enquêtes dans des régions éloignées et l'intérêt
pour la campagne y prédominait. L'anthropologie culturelle et sociale et Penvironnementalisme en tant que disci-
plines scientifiques demeuraient pratiquement inconnus. Les travaux contemporains ne puisent que très peu dans les
ouvrages de cette période; tous ces travaux n'ont donc pas encore été évalués de façon systématique et encore moins
utilisés. Cela tient en partie à leur médiocrité, mais aussi au manque de volonté de revenir sur cette période. Le projet
consistant à étudier la science au temps de la normalisation selon une approche sociologique n'a pas obtenu le soutien
des agences de subventions. Cette note de bas de page ne peut évoquer toutes les questions relatives à cette lacune
de la recherche, questions qui mériteraient pourtant une réflexion approfondie.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24657854<br>

Author(s): FRODEMAN ROBERT<br>
Abstract: Environmentally we seem to be both the victims and the perpetrators of a type of bait and switch: lured into the discussion by one set of intuitions, our interests become redescribed in terms that are intellectually more respectable. Our deepest concerns with the environment are converted into foreign discourses, as we strain to make the languages of science, economics, and interest group politics express our intuitions. The circumscription of environmental philosophy within environmental ethics is one manifestation of this process of bait and switch. 'Corrosive Effects' critiques this process through a case study of acid mine drainage-water pollution resulting from mining activities. An analysis of acid mine drainage reveals the metaphysical and theological roots of many of our environmental problems.<br>

Author(s): Llewelyn John<br>
Abstract: What demands must be met for phenomenology to be the rigorous science Husserl projected? Janicaud complains that some French phenomenologists, while pretending to observe these demands, play fast and loose with them when they apply phenomenology to matters of theology: Derrida, Marion, and Levinas; methodological phenomenology and Henry's phenomenology of the Christian Way. Derrida's deconstructions of the oppositions of immanence and transcendence and of the factual and the transcendental suggest that the rift between him and Henry is not as deep as it must at first seem. Analogical appresentation is a motive of the theological turn.<br>

Abstract: See the Diltheyan vein in which Peter Winch (1977, 103) states the purpose of a philoso-
phy of the social sciences:...the investigation of a human society, whose very nature is to
consist in different and competing ways of life, each offering a different account of the
intelligibility of things. To take an uncommitted view of such competing conceptions is
peculiarly the task of philosophy; it is not its business to award prizes to science, religion, or
anything else. It is not its business to advocate any Weltanschauung.'<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the conduct and evaluation of interpretive research in information systems. While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies. A set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field research in information systems is proposed, along with their philosophical rationale. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by evaluating three published interpretive field studies drawn from the IS research literature. The intention of the paper is to further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding interpretive research methodology.<br>

Issue: i323911<br>

Author(s): Gould Peter<br>
Abstract: In Science, great difficulty is sometimes experienced in giving up hypothesized structures. The inadequacies of Freudian hypotheses are highlighted, and attention is directed to Dasein-analysis, which stays close to the data. This perspective focuses attention upon the phenomenological tradition, and suggests that certain mathematical frameworks in human geography are inappropriate. The adequacy of a priori models is also questioned from a Heideggerian perspective, and more general qualitative algebras are suggested to replace the distorted functional thinking inherited from the physical sciences.<br>

Article Title: Responsibility and nanotechnology<br>
Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i25677409<br>
Date: 6 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Kelty Christopher<br>
Abstract: In this paper we argue that the concept and practice of responsibility is being transformed within science and engineering. It tells the story of attempts by nanotechnologists to make responsibility 'do-able' and calculable in a setting where the established language and tools of risk and risk analysis are seen as inadequate. The research is based on ethnographic participant-observation at the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) at Rice University in Texas, during the period 2003 to 2007, including the controversies and public discussions it was engaged in and the creation of the International Council on Nanotechnology (ICON). CBEN began as a project to study 'applications' of nanotechnology to environmental and biological systems, but turned immediately to the study of 'implications' to biology and environment. We argue here that the notion of 'implications' and the language of risk employed early on addressed two separate but entangled ideas: the risks that nanomaterials pose to biology and environment, and the risks that research on this area poses to the health of nanotechnology itself. Practitioners at CBEN sought ways to accept responsibility both as scientists with a duty to protect science (from the public, from de-funding, from 'backlash') and as citizens with a responsibility to protect the environment and biology through scientific research. Ultimately, the language of risk has failed, and in its place ideas about responsibility, prudence, and accountability for the future have emerged, along with new questions about the proper venues and 'modes of veridiction' by which claims about safety or responsibility might be scientifically adjudicated.<br>

Article Title: Qur'an and Science: A Hermeneutical Approach / ‮القرآن والعلم: منهج تفسيري‬<br>
Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
Issue: i25728159<br>
Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): ‮کامبانيني‬ ‮ماسيمو‬<br>
Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Author(s): Smircich Linda<br>
Abstract: Debates regarding research methods in the social sciences are linked directly to assumptions about ontology, epistemology, and human nature. After reviewing a range of positions relating to these assumptions, we argue that the dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative methods is a rough and oversimplified one. Contemporary social science is dominated by commitments to research methods almost as ends in themselves, resulting in abstracted modes of empiricism based on both quantitative and qualitative methods. Qualitative research is an approach rather than a particular set of techniques, and its appropriateness derives from the nature of the social phenomena to be explored.<br>

Author(s): Dowd Garin<br>
Abstract: This essay is a reply to Matthew Feldman's identification and advocacy (in SBT/A 16) of a methodological "partition" in Beckett studies. It argues that the 'critical tribunal' set up by his article may be contested on the grounds that: the advocated paradigm for research makes a contentious journey from science to literature; it dogmatically imposes restrictions on the range of literary critical interventions deemed to be of value; it employs a 'black box' approach to its own argument.<br>

Author(s): Zey-Ferrell Andrew J.<br>
Abstract: Critical theory is presented as a general method for analyzing an organization science based on either a natural science or interpretive paradigm. This is accomplished by introducing epistemic inquiry into organization science methodology. Specifically, critical theory provides a means of examining the socio-political interplay among the researcher, the research enterprise, the practitioner, and the organization members. Such an analysis requires the examination of ideology, technology, and praxis.<br>

Article Title: International Relations and the Search for Thinking Space: Another View of the Third Debate<br>
Publisher: Butterworth Publishers<br>
Issue: i324420<br>
Date: 9 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): George Jim<br>
Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Author(s): Offenstadt Nicolas<br>
Abstract: Cet entretien, réalisé à l'occasion de la parution du dernier ouvrage d'Arno J. Mayer, Les Furies, permet de retracer l'itinéraire intellectuel de cet historien du contemporain nourri de science politique et d'un marxisme hétérodoxe. Il met en lumière tout l'intérêt des méthodes et des questionnements d'un chercheur soucieux de penser de manière comparée les moments de crise sociale et politique en Europe et d'en comprendre la violence. Les prises de position politiques d'A. J. Mayer éclairent son œuvre et dessinent les difficultés et les originalités d'un parcours engagé dans l'université américaine depuis la fin des années 1950. This interview, conducted on the occasion of the publication of Arno J. Mayer's latest book, Les Furies, recounts the intellectual itinerary of this historian of the contemporary period, nurtured by political science and unorthodox Marxism. It brings out the interesting aspects of the methods and questioning used by this researcher who studies moments of social and political crisis in Europe comparatively and aims at understanding their violence. The political positions taken by A. J. Mayer help explain his writings and indicate the problems and originality of the path taken by a committed scholar who has been working in American universities since the end of the 1950s.<br>

Abstract: Freud, 'Civilization and its Discontents', XXI, pp. 115,116. Freud was highly crit-
ical of Woodrow Wilson, whom he considered a naive leader who misread the mutual
hostility inherent in social life. On this point, see Brunner, Freud: The Politics of Psycho-
analysis, ch. 4. It is important to note that when fascism emerged in Europe, Freud's sug-
gestion that the leader is essential to the formation of groups was strongly criticized.
Erich Fromm, for example, saw in his age a disintegration of the super-ego or conscience
(p. 167), and suggested that it is precisely the lack of individuality that springs from this
disintegration that propels men and women to crave an all-powerful leader and external
source of authority (or the anonymous rein of public opinion, the norm and science in
democratic regimes). Fascism, according to this interpretation, springs from the inability
of modern men and women to cope with their freedom and individuality, and with their
corresponding aloneness (or homelessness) in the world. See Erich Fromm, Escape
From Freedom (New York, 1941), especially chs. 5 and 7.<br>

Abstract: The benefits of increasing the contribution of the social sciences in the fields of environmental and conservation science disciplines are increasingly recognized. However, integration between the social and natural sciences has been limited, in part because of the barrier caused by major philosophical differences in the perspectives between these research areas. This paper aims to contribute to more effective interdisciplinary integration by explaining some of the philosophical views underpinning social research and how these views influence research methods and outcomes. We use a project investigating the motivation of volunteers working in an adaptive co-management project to eradicate American Mink from the Cairngorms National Park in Scotland as a case study to illustrate the impact of philosophical perspectives on research. Consideration of different perspectives promoted explicit reflection of the contributing researcher’s assumptions, and the implications of his or her perspectives on the outcomes of the research. We suggest a framework to assist conservation research projects by: (1) assisting formulation of research questions; (2) focusing dialogue between managers and researchers, making underlying worldviews explicit; and (3) helping researchers and managers improve longer-term strategies by helping identify overall goals and objectives and by identifying immediate research needs.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i327968<br>
Date: 4 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Webster Steven<br>
Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Author(s): Hershberger John K.<br>
Abstract: This paper places the problem of child abuse in the perspective of evil. In so doing it calls into question the amoral assumptions of social science and human services. The current social science paradigm paradoxically dismisses evil as a real factor in the world, despite its concern for indisputably moral issues such as child abuse. The practical advantages of a perspective incorporating evil are several. Among them are a more realistic appreciation of the need for mechanisms of social control in preventing abuse, the role of confession and conversion, and the role of pastoral care as a support system for families.<br>

Abstract: Temporal lobe epilepsy and certain personality disorders often result in experiences described as "religious." TLE research suggests a possible neurological basis for such experiences. Immediately the question arises about the authenticity of these experiences as religious. An experience is authentic if it furthers the authentic growth of the subject, regardless of what triggered it. So pathology may occasion authentic religious experiences, even as history exemplifies. For practical purposes, the further question about God in religious experience is secondary. The exception, miraculous occurrences, should not be granted without sufficient reason. This approach dissolves all conflict between science and faith.<br>

Abstract: Tal discusión se encuentra de nuevo en Andrew Abbott, ibid., ps. 226-230. La section espe-
cial dedicada a la cuestión por Social Science History (vol. 16, números 3 y 4 de 1992), la revis-
ta oficial de la Social Science History Association, introducida por William H. Sewell, Jr., contó
con artículos de gente tan significativa como George Steinmetz, Mary Jo Maynes, Margaret R.
Somers, Janet Hart y Luisa Passerini. Un argumento provocador y claramente favorable a la
narración lo defiende Alan Megill en "Recounting the Past: Description, Explanation and
Narrative in Historiography", The American Historical Review, 94, 3 (1989), ps. 627-653 (tra-
ducción en Historia Social, 16, 1993). Tratamientos más amplios del tema se encuentran,
como se sabe, en Paul Ricoeur, Tiempoy narración. Configuratión del tiempo en el re lato
histórico, Ediciones Cristiandad, Madrid, 1987 y en Hayden White, The Content of the Form.
Narrative, Discourse and Historical Representation, The Johns Hopkins University Press,

mentación de la historia he tratado en "El futur de la història: balanç i perspectives", en Ángel

Abstract: Recent advances in animal studies have documented the widespread use of learned, symbolic communication in the animal kingdom. Meanwhile, Mechling (1989) has argued that folklore, as shared learned traditions, also exists in non-human animals. Considering that many scholars believe humans are unique in our ability to tell stories, this schism between human and animal, the story and other folklore, has a great deal to tell us about the outlines and origins of humanity. This article seeks to integrate arguments from linguistics, archaeology, primatology, folklore, and cognitive science from evolutionary perspectives.<br>

Abstract: El autor propugna que el conocimiento en el ámbito de las ciencias sociales no se puede comparar fácilmente con el conocimiento puramente filosófico o el conocimiento histórico ni reducirlo a uno u otro. De hecho, tiene sus raíces en la comunidad y, por lo tanto, da lugar a una empresa colectiva. En esencia, se basa en una interacción entre seres humanos y presupone una relación de confianza mutua entre el investigador y los miembros del grupo social que se va a investigar en una situación dada. Un enfoque cualitativo, que sitúe en un mismo plano al investigador y a los investigados, parece por tanto necesario. Cuesta creer que una persona pueda estar dispuesta a confesar sus experiencias (Erlebnisse) a una grabadora o a un cuestionario rígidamente precodificado. The Author's contention is that knowledge in social science cannot be easily compared and reduced either to purely philosophical knowledge or to historical knowledge. In fact, it is community grounded and therefore it results in a collective enterprise. In essence, it is based on an interaction among human beings and it presupposes a relation of mutual trust between the researcher and the members of the social group to be investigated in a given situation. Therefore, a qualitative approach whereby researcher and researched are in the same footing and involved in a face to face relationship seems to be necessary. It is hard to believe that somebody would willingly confess his/her Erlebnisse to a tape-recording machine or to a rigidly precodified questionnaire.<br>

Date: 9 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Reyna S. P.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates two questions: have literary anthropologists offered telling critiques of science; and have they proposed another, more powerful, mode of knowing? It is suggested that neither literary anthropologists, hermeneutical philosophers, nor philosophers of science have constructed arguments that compel the rejection of science. `Thick description', offered as an alternative to science, is shown to exhibit properties of gossip. Thus the article responds to both questions in the negative and, in conclusion, proposes that the literary anthropological approach amounts to a doctrine of Panglossian nihilism.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i212608<br>
Date: 8 1, 1942<br>
Author(s): Pepper Chunglin<br>
Abstract: This paper considers some aspects of the early history of the American contribution to the International Biological Programme (IBP), ecology's only venture into 'Big Science'. It is argued that American ecologists were successful in obtaining generous funding for the IBP from the US Congress, thanks to a shared understanding of the way in which controlling nature was to be accomplished, expressed in the metaphor of the 'cybernetic machine'. To support this argument, a literary analysis is performed on Congressional documents, on scientific and popular books and papers by ecologists, and on writings of the environmental movement. The paper explores how a dominant representation of nature, or mentalité, is brought about, and its political effects.<br>

Article Title: Mythic Language and Gender Subversion: The Case of Ruskin's Athena<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i348147<br>
Date: 12 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Weltman Sharon Aronofsky<br>
Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Abstract: L'exégèse biblique contemporaine associe une longue tradition herméneutique au développement moderne des sciences philologiques et historiques. Marqué par la séparation des Églises et de l'État ainsi que par la "crise moderniste" au sein du catholicisme, ce domaine savant s'interroge aujourd'hui en France sur son avenir et sur son rôe dans l'espace public. Dans leur diversité universitaire ou ecclésiale, les biblistes français ne participent pas moins au cours international et pluriconfessionnel de recherche. Où la théologie, momentanément séparée de la science positive, sert en fait d'aiguillon à la recherche historique et anthropologique. Et où en définitive, le texte, atelier de l'exégète, s'impose comme un vecteur de dépassement des vieux clivages de la science et de la croyance. /// The contemporary biblical interpretation associates a long hermeneutical tradition with the modern development of philological and historical sciences. Marked by the Separation of Churches and State, also by the "modernistic crisis" within Catholicism, this field of scholarship wonders today in France on its future and its part in the public space. Although connected with University or Church, the French biblical specialists do not take part less in the international and interdenominational research. The theology, temporarily separated from positive science, is finally stirring up historical and anthropological studies. At last for the scholar, Holly Scripture as workshop is used to overstep the old bounds of science and believe. /// La exégesis bíblica contemporánea asocia una larga tradición hermenéutica al desarrollo moderno de las ciencias psicológicas e históricas. Marcado por la separación de las Iglesias y el Estado así como por la "crisis modernista" en el seno del catolicismo, este ámbito de saberes se pregunta hoy en Francia sobre su futuro y sobre su rol en el espacio público. Dentro de su diversidad universitaria o eclesial, los biblistas franceses no dejan de participar~<br>

Abstract: This article introduces a special issue of the British Journal of Ethnomusicology on "music and meaning". It does so by offering some thoughts on "meaning" in the context of north Indian rāga music and by sketching the outline of an approach to musical meaning influenced by perspectives from ethnomusicology, psychological anthropology, cognitive science and cultural studies. The article proposes that all music is necessarily meaningful insofar as it offers to the perceiving subject possibilities for action and imagination, and that meaning is wholly dependent neither on semiosis nor on the apprehension of formal or structural relationships.<br>

Author(s): Zumbach Steven W.<br>
Abstract: A formal claim was made in the mid-20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but concurrent debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficulty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful perspectives on the essential nature of art and the autonomy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. /// [French] Au milieu du 20e siècle, on prétendait que l'objectif de la restauration était de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner. La controverse qui s'en suivit parmi les restaurateurs et les historiens d'art suscita des différences de considération sur les rôles relatifs de la science et de l'histoire de l'art dans l'interprétation de l'intention de l'artiste. Un débat séparé mais parallèle parmi les philosophes, les critiques d'art et les critiques littéraires~<br>

Author(s): Blades David<br>
Abstract: Against the backdrop of Blades's analysis in Foucauldian terms of the failure of a particular science-technology-society reform, this review addresses four questions: (1) the problem of postmodern writing as a language of rupture; (2) the justification of science-technology-society approaches to science teaching; (3) the fruitfulness of Foucault's explanatory framework for understanding educational change; (4) the fruitfulness of Foucault's framework for education theory in general. It is argued that Foucault's notion of authors who are "founders of discursivity" can form the basis of both a productive theory of educational change and also of an educational vision in which a school strives to become a community of such founders of discursivity.<br>

Journal Title: Curriculum Inquiry<br>
Article Title: The Role of Interest in Fostering Sixth Grade Students' Identities as Competent Learners<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i360632<br>
Date: 4 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Tobias Arati<br>
Abstract: The combined works of John Dewey and Jerome Bruner provide a framework spanning a century of educational thought which can inform curriculum decisions concerning students' educational development, especially for middle school students whose waning of motivation toward school has been well documented by researchers and has long concerned parents and teachers. This framework, combined with recent contributions of motivation and interest researchers, can create broad understandings of how to collaboratively construct effective educational contexts. As early as 1913, Dewey specifically looked at the pivotal role of students' genuine interests in Interest and Effort in Education. Our current research focus on how students' interest can inform curricular contexts marks the recent shift showing an increased use of interest in education research since 1990. In this article, we discuss our study of a team-taught double classroom of sixth grade students whose interests were determined through a series of brainstorming sessions, and individual and focus group interviews. Students' interests fell into six categories centering around subject areas such as Drama, Science, and Animal Studies. Learning contexts were constructed around four of these subject areas. Students participated in their first or second choice of subject area group. We found significantly higher scores on measures of Affect and Activation if students participated in their first choice group. We found intra-group unities of preferred and dispreferred ways of learning which distinguished each group from the class as a whole. Finally, our findings indicated that students reliably described their genuine interests over time. Students' interests were found to be effective tools for informing curriculum decisions in the creation of sixth grade learning contexts.<br>

Article Title: The Division of Labor in Social Science Research: Unified Methodology or "Organic Solidarity"?<br>
Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>
Issue: i362393<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Somers Rudra<br>
Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Publisher: Religious Research Association<br>

Date: 10 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Winter Gibson<br>
Abstract: The natural science model has fostered fragmentation among the human sciences, leaving them ill-equipped to address matters of public policy which demand more holistic approaches. This paper proposes a science of political ethics which could encompass factual, normative, and value materials. Ricoeur's processes of guessing, explanation, and comprehension are used to develop a theory of interpretation for the new science. The work of art is used as the metaphor for interpreting societal processes.<br>

Publisher: Religious Research Association<br>
Issue: i284834<br>
Date: 10 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Zuck W. Widick<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the professionalization of religious research in the United States and related topics. Because professional societies illumine value orientations and practices among workers in a given field, the nature of the American Catholic Sociological Society, the American Society of Christian Ethics, the Religious Research Association, and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion are briefly considered. The differential appropriation of religious research in various ecclesiastical bodies, the problem of funding religious research in the American situation, and the shift in emphasis from a pragmatic problem-solving approach focused on institutional survival to a more theoretical approach to the understanding of religious phenomena are discussed. The bifurcation between persons interested in religious research trained under theological faculties and those trained under social science faculties is noted. Likely future lines of development in theory and research are projected.<br>

Article Title: Retheorizing Economic Geography: From the Quantitative Revolution to the "Cultural Turn"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i370115<br>
Date: 9 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Wrigley Trevor J.<br>
Abstract: In this article, I reflect upon and attempt to understand the changing theoretical nature of post-World War II Anglo-American economic geography. In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the "cultural turn" or the "new economic geography." I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Critical Theoretic Perspective in Information Systems<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Benoît Gerald<br>
Abstract: The field of library and information science (LIS) has built its practice and research perspective on a logico-analytic philosophy, which has generated useful, tangible technologies. Lately there is interest in nonempirical philosophies, such as hermeneutics and critical theory, to fulfill better LIS' service-oriented mission of providing "information" to user populations. One dimension of critical theory, Jürgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, can expand LIS' conception of information and supplement logico-empirical research methods and research practices. This article examines how LIS, particularly research into librarian-patron interaction and information system design, favors an empiricist view of language and, as a consequence, may be limiting its effectiveness. It proposes how the field might expand to include communicative action in fulfilling its mission and research agenda.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Article Title: Cinco malentendidos acerca de la investigación mediante los estudios de caso<br>
Publisher: Centro de Investigaciones Sociologicas<br>
Issue: i40005571<br>
Date: 6 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Flyvbjerg Bent<br>
Abstract: Este artículo examina cinco malentendidos comunes sobre la investigación mediante estudios de caso: 1) el conocimiento teórico es más valioso que el conocimiento práctico; 2) no podemos generalizar a partir de un solo caso y, por lo tanto, el estudio de un solo caso no puede contribuir al desarrollo científico; 3) los estudios de caso son más útiles para generar hipótesis, mientras otros métodos son más adecuados para verificar las hipótesis y construir las teorías; 4) el estudio de caso contiene un sesgo hacia la verificación, y 5) suele ser difícil resumir estudios de caso específicos. El artículo explica y corrige estos malentendidos uno por uno y concluye con el principio kuhniano de que una disciplina científica que carece de una elevada cantidad de estudios de caso concienzudamente desarrollados es una disciplina sin producción sistemática de ejemplares, y una disciplina sin ejemplares es una disciplina ineficaz. La ciencia social debe reforzarse mediante la realización de más estudios profundos de caso. /// This article examines five common misunderstandings about case-study research: (1) Theoretical knowledge is more valuable than practical knowledge; (2) One cannot generalize from a single case, therefore the single case study cannot contribute to scientific development; (3) The case study is most useful for generating hypotheses, while other methods are more suitable for hypotheses testing and theory building; (4) The case study contains a bias toward verification; and (5) It is often difficult to summarize specific case studies. The article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and that a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of more good case studies.<br>

Abstract: Partindo do principio de que o surgimento da ciência, vinculada desde a sua origem à filosofia, constitui um dos signos especificos do "espirito europeu", no que Gadamer se aproxima de Husserl, o artigo procura dilucidar em que medida ospressupostos da hermeneutica gadameriana – cujas categorias axiais analisa – esclarecem o pluralismo linguistico que caracteriza a Europa, o qual, por sua vez, funda, pela consciência de alteridade que implica, um expressivo e activo pluralismo cultural. Mostra ainda como "todos nós somos outros e todos nós somos nós mesmos", na medida em que viver a diferença e avaliar a resistência do que é o outro equivale a viver uma nova experiência da própria identidade. Finalmente, dado que a aspiração para a universalidade não se obtém contra o particular e o especifico, mas através destes, o artigo analisa até que ponto o "ideal europeu" de Gadamer converge para uma união, ou seja, para um estado de coisas em que o universal é justamente potenciado pelas diferenças que existem entre as culturas dos povos europeus. /// On the principle that the emergence of science constitutes one of the distinguishing signs of the "European Spirit", this article endeavors to investigate how the presuppositions of Gadamer's hermeneutics sheds light on the linguistic pluralism that characterizes Europe and her consequent sensitivity towards otherness. The article also demonstrates how we at once are ourselves and others to the degree that we experience differences, increasing thus our own sense of identity. Finally, universality is not opposed to the particular and the specific. This is shown in the fact that Gadamer's "European Ideal" points towards a universality nourished by the cultural differences that exist among the peoples of Europe.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo reflecte sobre o significado critico dos conceitos de tradição e preconceito, noções fundamentias da filosofia hermeneutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer. Visa de forma particular a contestação que o autor faz da moderna redução do sentido da filosofia. Filosofia ou teoria da ciência, eis os termos de uma questão que atravessa o pensamento de Gadamer, desde Verdade e Método, até aos últimos textos. Para o filosofo, na raiz originária do sentido está um modo ôntico de ser, caracterizado pela memória, pelo efeito histórico da tradição e pela necessidade de formação. A razão, que se sabe hoje historica e finita, parte sempre de pressupostos, que marcam a sua basilar inserção na comunidade da palavra já sempre partilhada e nos lembram como é ilusório o sonho iluminista de uma transparência total. /// This article is a reflexion about the critical meaning of the concept of tradition and prejudice in the hermeneutical philosopphy of H.-G. Gadamer. It focuses on Gadamer's protest against the modern reduction of the meaning of philosophy. Philosophy or theory of science are the terms of the question that crosses all of Gadamer's thought, from Wahrheit und Methode until the later works. At the root of meaning is for Gadamer an ontological way of being characterized by memory, the historic effect of tradition and the need of formation. Reason, which we now know as historical and finite, is grounded on presuposed ideas which mark its fundamental insertion in the comunity of the world, already shared, and remind us of how deceptive the iluminist dream of a total transparency actually is.<br>

Article Title: Bernard Lonergan e a Inteligência: Para uma Introdução ao sen Pensamento<br>

Abstract: A obra principal de Bernard Lonergan Inteligência: Um ensaio sobre o conhecimento humano, é um tratado que leva a cabo uma integração segundo o método transcendental dos conhecimentos heterogéneos da ciência, da filosofia, do senso comum e da teologia. A obra visa a auto-apropriação da nossa auto-consciência intelectual e racional com base na experiência consciente dos actos de intelecção. Começa como teoria cognitiva, expande-se para uma metafísica e uma ética, e avança para uma concepção e uma afirmação de Deus, para ser finalmente confrontada com o problema do mal que exige a transformação da inteligência auto-confiante no intellectus quaerens fidem. Ao cumprir estes objectivos, Inteligência tornou-se uma das mais importantes obras de filosofia do século XX, aqui sucintamente elucidada em cinco das suas principais vertentes: a relação entre conhecimento e realidade, conhecimento científico e cosmologia, a acção humana e a ética, as questões de interpretação, a relação entre natureza de Deus e filosofia. O artigo conclui com uma avaliação da cosmopolis lonerganiana, ou seja, o poder da comunidade de espírito na sociedade. /// Bernard Lonergan s opus magnum, Insight: A Study of human understanding, handles the heterogeneous fields of knowledge as given in science, philosophy, common sense and theology according to a transcendental method. The work aims at the self-appropriation of human intellectual and rational self-conscience as based in the conscious experience of insight. Lonergan s work starts as a cognitive theory, and advances, through metaphysics and ethics, to a conception and affirmation of God, one that is confronted with the problem of evil and therefore requires a transformation of self-confident intelligence into the intellectus quaerens fidem. Handling these goals, Insight became one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20 th century. The present article deals with five of the main issues in Lonergan s work: the relation between knowledge~<br>

Author(s): King Roger J. H.<br>
Abstract: This essay presents a contextualist defense of the role of narrative and metaphor in the articulation of environmental ethical theories. Both the intelligibility and persuasiveness of ecocentric concepts and arguments presuppose that proponents of these ideas can connect with the narratives and metaphors guiding the expectations and interpretations of their audiences. Too often objectivist presuppositions prevent the full contextualization of environmental ethical arguments. The result is a disembodied environmental discourse with diminished influence on citizens and policy makers. This essay is a pragmatist call for more philosophical attention to locating speakers, audiences, and meanings in more intelligible "discursive spaces." © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.<br>

Author(s): Hart Curtis W.<br>
Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Article Title: Cinco equívocos sobre la investigatión basada en estudios de caso<br>
Publisher: El Colegio de México<br>
Issue: i40019118<br>
Date: 8 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Murillo Lorena<br>
Abstract: El autor examina cinco equívocos comunes con respecto a la investigatión basada en estudios de caso: 1) el conocimiento teórico es más valioso que el conocimiento práctico; 2) no puede generalizarse a partir de un caso individual y, por tanto, los estudios de caso individuales no pueden contribuir al progreso cientifico; 3) los estudios de caso son más útiles para generar hipótesis, mientras que otros métodos son más apropiados para comprobar hipótesis y elaborar teorías; 4) los estudios de caso tienen un sesgo hacia la verificatión, y 5) a menudo resulta dificil sintetizar los estudios de caso específicos. Flyvbjerg explica y corrige cada uno de estos equívocos, concluyendo con el planteamiento kuhniano de que una disciplina científica carente de estudios de caso cuidadosamente realizados es una disciplina carente de una producción sistemática de ejemplares y, por lo tanto, inefícaz. La ciencia social podria fortalecerse mediante la realización de más y mejores estudios de caso. /// This article examines five common misunderstandings about case-study research: 1) theoretical knowledge is more valuable than practical knowledge; 2) one cannot generalize from a single case, therefore the single case study cannot contribute to scientific development; 3) the case study is most useful for generating hypotheses, while other methods are more suitable for hypotheses testing and theory building; 4) the case study contains a bias toward verification; and 5) it is often difficult to summarize specific case studies. The article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and that a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of more good case studies.<br>

Publisher: Heldref Publications<br>
Issue: i40023288<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Hendry Petra Munro<br>
Abstract: The author suggests that all research is narrative. Resituating all research as narrative, as opposed to characterizing narrative as one particular form of inquiry, provides a critical space for rethinking research beyond current dualisms and bifurcations that create boundaries that limit the capacity for dialogue across diverse epistemologies. The contemporary bifurcation of research as either quantitative or qualitative, or as scientific or nonscientific, has resulted in a master narrative of research which assumes incommensurability across paradigms. The author weaves 3 questions through this research: (a) What is lost when narrative and science are constructed as opposing and incommensurable modes of inquiry? (b) How might scholars reconceptualize inquiry outside a binary framework that privileges science? and (c) In what ways can resituating all narrative as inquiry open spaces for dialogue across multiple epistemologies that is the heart of democratic inquiry? The author concludes by suggesting that narrative is not a method, but rather a process of meaning making that encompasses 3 major spheres of inquiry: the scientific (physical), the symbolic (human experience) and the sacred (metaphysical).<br>

Publisher: Vereeniging voor Wijsgeerige Uitgaven<br>
Issue: i40039569<br>
Date: 3 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): DE BRIE G. A.<br>
Abstract: L'éthique de la situation (Situationsethik) est une tendance diffuse, qui s'infiltre dans les systèmes éthiques les plus divers, plutôt qu'une doctrine aux arêtes bien nettes. Il faut cependant qu'on détermine son idée et il semble que ses positions extrêmes se prêtent le mieux à une clarification de son contenu. Elle s'oppose à toute éthique normative abstraite et universelle. Par contraste apparaissent certaines lignes maîtresses, au moins négatives. Les systèmes principalement visés sont le rationalisme, qu'il soit formel ou à contenu matériel, l'éthique sociologique positiviste (Science des mœurs de Durkheim, Lévy-Bruhl...) et toute éthique de l'essence. L'abstraction et l'universalité, l'immutabilité et l'extrinsécisme des normes morales sont les caractères mis en question. Nous nous attachons à montrer que l'éthique de l'essence, telle que la conçoit la tradition chrétienne, ne comporte pas nécessairement les caractères incriminés au sens péjoratif ou la „Situationsethik” les entend. Nous croyons même qu'une éthique de l'essence de par son statut même - certaines formes historiques peuvent être des déviations - tient compte de la situation concrète et historique. Elle le fait de deux manières bien différentes, d'abord en ce qu'elle intègre dans ses impératifs universels les situations les plus diverses, et en second lieu en ce qu'elle pose comme principe obligatoire et universel que chacun doit se laisser conduire par certains impératifs moraux, que lui seul peut voir, du fait qu'ils tiennent à sa situation unique, non seulement de fait mais en principe. En effet, une éthique de l'essence transpose en impératifs moraux aussi bien ce qui appartient à la structure essentielle de l'homme (impératifs absolument universels), que ce qui relève de la contingence, telles les circonstances extérieures et intérieures, qui sont susceptible de se répéter, si pas de fait au moins de droit (impératifs relativementuniversels). La norme morale concrète, qui se dégage de la co~<br>

Abstract: When Nietzsche is called a radical philosopher, it is (among other reasons) because he questions (or at least claims to call into question) what other thinkers take for granted. In the article I concentrate on the way in which Nietzsche asks his questions, and how his questions (and the vocabulary which he uses to express his questions) develop through his writings. This development can be summarized with the help of a comparison between the orginal preface to the Birth of Tragedy (1872) and the new preface for the edition of 1886: it is a development from only a few and mainly rhetorical questions to a great number of intricate questions that often are selfreferential and call the questioner himself into question. The article points out how Nietzsche gradually discovers his proper question and how this search reaches it climax around 1886. This proper question turns out to be a practical or existential one: "To what extent can truth endure incorporation?" (Gay Science p. 110)<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40040354<br>
Date: 12 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Villani A.<br>
Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science app~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i378430<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): White Stephen M.<br>
Abstract: Law professors and political scientists generally subscribe to opposed theories of Supreme Court decision making. Law professors, to a great degree, adhere to an internal view: Supreme Court justices decide cases according to legal rules, principles, and precedents. Political scientists follow an external view: justices decide cases according to their political ideologies or preferences. This article develops an interpretive-structural theory that harmonizes these seemingly opposed views. This interpretive-structural theory not only explains why the internal and external views often are both effective but also why, sometimes, one approach might be more effective than the other. The article concludes by comparing the interpretive-structural theory with the "new institutionalism" that is emerging in political science.<br>

Abstract: La catégorie de « temporalisation » est omniprésente dans les textes fondateurs de la Begriffsgeschichte koselleckienne. Elle renvoie à la question générale de la temporalité humaine et au problème épistémologique des temporalités historiques en particulier. Elle constitue en outre, pour Koselleck, un cadre interprétatif fondamental de notre modernité politique. Ce texte revient sur ces différents problèmes en reconstruisant la « théorie générale de l'expérience historique » qui se trouve à l'arrière-plan. Un inventaire des usages analytiques de la catégorie de « temporalisation » est ensuite proposé. Par là même, le schème de la « temporalisation » apparaît comme un processus global traversant notre modernité politique, en interaction avec d'autres processus englobants, qu'il s'agit aujourd'hui de tenter de typologiser dans la continuité certes, mais au-delà du cadre koselleckien initial. Soucieux de faire apparaître, en les distinguant et articulant ensemble, les différents niveaux d'analyse mis en œuvre par l'entreprise même de l'histoire des langages politiques modernes, cet article tente de réengager le dialogue entre l'histoire (structurelle, culturelle et événementielle) et les sciences politiques en reconnaissant un statut causal propre aux idées politiques et religieuses modernes, à la philosophie politique et juridique moderne, à l'inertie des sémantiques historiques sur la longue durée : toutes choses qui ne peuvent être causalement, et partant disciplinairement, disqualifiées que parce que l'on part d'une vision étriquée et pauvre de ce qu'est l'expérience de l'histoire. The notion of 'temporalization' is one of the key concepts in the Koselleckian Begriffsgeschichte. It refers to the general issue of human temporality and more specifically to the epistemological problem of historical temporalities. In Koselleck's writings, it constitutes a fundamental interpretative framework for political modernity as a whole. This article returns to these different is~<br>

Article Title: Exercice des mémoires possibles et littérature « à-présent » La transcription de l'histoire dans le roman contemporain<br>
Publisher: Éditions de l'École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales<br>
Issue: i40041832<br>

Author(s): Bouju Emmanuel<br>
Abstract: Cet article propose d'explorer les enjeux d'une écriture romanesque contemporaine définie comme douleur fantôme de l'histoire et exercice de ses mémoires possibles: deux séries complémentaires d'exemples – liées pour l'une à la réinvention d'une mémoire du bourreau par un narrateur « sosie » de l'historien (Manuel Vázquez Montalbán et Jonathan Littell), et pour l'autre à la saisie de l'historicité des temps présents sous l'angle conjoint de la mélancolie et de l'ironie (David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon et Dubravka Ugrešić) – permettent d'éclairer l'ambition romanesque de transcription de l'histoire dans l'exercice « à-présent » (ou « au temps-maintenant » , selon l'expression de Walter Benjamin) de ses mémoires possibles. En courant le risque d'une rivalité ou d'une confusion trompeuse entre les statuts du discours historiographique et du récit romanesque, et en s'exposant à la récusation par le lecteur de sa légitimité en la matière, le roman contemporain choisit de s'établir dans les plis du savoir historien et ainsi d'engager ses moyens propres dans l'entreprise d'une écriture en palimpseste du texte virtuel, ou idéal, de l'expérience historique. This article sets out to investigate those aspects of the contemporary novel in which fiction writing delves into the ghost pains of history and experiments with its would-be memories. Two sets of complementary examples will allow us to shed light on this particular novelistic ambition, i.e. transcribing history into a "to-day" (or "now-time", to use a phrase coined by Walter Benjamin) experimentation with its virtual memories. The first set of texts (by Manuel Vázquez Montalbán and Jonathan Littell) illustrates the reinvention of the executioner's memory courtesy of a narrator passing himself for a double of the historian. The second series of novels (by David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon and Dubravka Ugrešić) features several attempts to grasp the historical quality of present times at the articulation of melancholy and ~<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>

Author(s): Schnell Izhak<br>
Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions f~<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo explora cuestiones relacionadas con la nueva diversidad y complejidad de la cultura europea, y procura hacerlo con referencia a debates contemporáneos en torno al cosmopolitismo. Un argumento central es que las ciencias sociales "dominantes" permanecen inadecuadas, en tanto que tratan estas cuestiones de forma abstracta y de manera superficial -sin tocar a nadie. El artículo propone una aproximación más concreta y sustantiva a la agenda cosmopolita -incluso poética-, ofreciendo sugerencias en términos de discursos alternativos relevantes -aquellos que han sido marginados a través de la elaboración histórica de lo que ha devenido la versión hegemónica de la cultura y tradición europeas. Se presenta una exploración de términos como "asombro" y "metamorfosis" (aparentemente obsoletos y quizás excéntricos), así como de la importancia comunicativa del pensamiento metafórico. Se argumenta que, al abordar el dilema cultural europeo contemporáneo, la finalidad es desarrollar un evocativo, y por lo tanto significativo y comunicativo, discurso en torno ai cosmopolitismo -en efecto, otra manera de narrarlo. This article explores issues relating to the new diversity and complexity within European culture, and seeks to do so with reference to contemporary debates on cosmopolitanism. A central argument is that the "mainstream" social science remains inadequate, in that it deals with the issues in an abstract and formulaic way -touching no-one. The article argues for a more concrete and substantive (and even poetic) approach to the cosmopolitan agenda, putting forward suggestions as to relevant alternative discourses -discourses that have been marginalised in and through the historical elaboration of what has become the hegemonic version of European culture and tradition. There is an exploration of such (seemingly obsolete, and maybe eccentric) terms as "wonder" and "metamorphosis", and of the communicative significance of metaphorical thinking. The point in addressi~<br>

Issue: i40063571<br>

Author(s): Casler Kenneth<br>
Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40064476<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Kühn Rolf<br>
Abstract: À la suite de la phénoménologie de Michel Henry ce texte analyse la structure fondamentale de la vie auto-affective se supportant toujours elle-même pour être co-originairement également la jouissance d'elle-même. En toute souffrance il faut alors reconnaître cette vie transcendentalement individuée qui veut vivre son « Je-Peux » fondamental en toutes ses modalisations. Toute « thérapie » se trouve ainsi plongée dans un « pathos-avec » dont l'exercice concret se révèle dans ce « regard transcendantal » sur la souffrance d'autrui sans méconnaître les possibilités de la science médicale qui reste, cependant, soumise à cette « communauté intro-pathique » primordiale. De cette manière, une certaine « praxis phénoménologique » peut affronter alors les défis de la civilisation d'aujourd'hui. Following the phenomenology of Michel Henry, this paper analyses the fundamental structure of the auto-affective life, always supporting itself for being equally co-originally the self-enjoyment. Therefore, one must acknowledge in every suffering this transcendentally individuated life which wants to live its fundamental "I can" in all its modalisations. Then, every "therapy" is plunged into a "pathos-with" whose concrete exercise reveals itself in this "transcendental view" on the other's suffering, without ignoring the possibilities of the medical science, that remains, however, subjected to this primordial "intropathic community". So, a certain "phenomenological praxis" can then face the challenges of today's civilization.<br>

Abstract: O artigo é uma leitura do debate epistemológico sobre as condições de conhecimento na antropologia. Partindo das críticas que o próprío C. Geertz faz a seus seguidores, a autora se propõe a avaliar o potencial crítico da hermenêutica. Recupera seu questionamento acerca da oposiçâo sujeito/objeto e propõe a busca de uma objetividade negociada interpares e situada historicamente. A partir desse debate questiona-se uma ciência pura e sem implicações práticas e morais. O percurso que faz avaliando vários autores lhe permite concluir que o excesso de relativismo ou de subjetivismo transforma toda possibilidade de ciência em ficção. Para dar conta em sua etnografia dos sistemas simbólicos não lingüísticos, a autora busca um diálogo entre a teoría antropológica e as teorias nativas e afirma que é na experiência vivida em campo que está a fertilidade das perguntas e reformulações de conceitos da antropologia. This article is an attempt to interpret the epistemological debate concerning conditions of knoledge in antropology. Discussing the criticism which C. Geertz has made in regard to the work of his followers, the autor proposes to evaluate the critical potential of hermeneutics. A critique of the subject-object split opens the way for proposing a form of objectivity wich is historically located and negotiated among equals. This debate constitutes a point os departure for questioning the notion of a pure science devoid of moral and practical implications. In the course of discussing a number of authors, the conclusion may well be that excessive relativism and subjectivism transform all possibilities of science into fiction. In order to deal with nonlinguistic symbolic systems in etnography, the author sees the importance of dialogue between anthropological theory and native theory. Fertile grounds for raising questions and reformulating anthropological concepts are found in fieldword experience.<br>

Author(s): Kemp Peter<br>
Abstract: L'auteur vise à scruter le fondement de l'éthique en opposant la conception éthique de Paul Ricoeur à celle de deux de ses prédécesseurs, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. Il montre comment Ricœur a défini la notion de raison pratique qui se distingue radicalement de toute science, et comment il a développé son éthique sans vision de l'évolution biologique et anthropologique. Grâce à Aristote et en passant par Kant, il a montré, dans Soi-même comme un autre (1990), le rôle éthique de la narrativité dans la formation de l'identité personnelle et de la responsabilité. The author proposes an analysis of the foundation of ethics by opposing Paul Ricoeur's conception of ethics to that of two of his predecessors, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. He shows how Ricœur has defined the notion of practical reason as radically different from any science, and how he has developed his ethics in independence from considerations related to biological and anthropological evolution. In Oneself as Another (1990), on the basis of Aristotle and reformulated in relation to Kantian principles, he has demonstrated the role of ethics and narration in the formation of personal identity and responsibility.<br>

Abstract: Valentin Lebedev is a pioneer of space and earth science in Russia. He is also the first ethnographic diarist of outer space. In 1982, while "on orbit" for 211 days as a fieldworking cosmonaut, Lebedev produced a thickly descriptive account of the intimate sociality and technoculture of the Soviet space complex Salyut 7. Crafted to defamiliarize (ostranenie) a spaceworld that publics saw as flawlessly engineered and managed, the diary is an argument for the value of exospheric (exo-) surprise in human experience. But on another level, we learn that the surprise is on humans who would claim to conquer "space-as-itself"—a "zero gravity" environment of force fields both extremely inhospitable to life as we know it and also generative of life in all its expressions.<br>

Abstract: Improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have led to an "epidemic" of survival. Yet we have limited understanding about the overall ramifications of survival and quality of extended life for this growing population of young people. In this paper I consider lived experiences of longterm survival following cancer in childhood from a social science perspective. I explore young people's negotiations of narrative identity and associated processes of coming to terms with their own subjective position as young adult survivors. Discussion is based on qualitative data collected from 57 young adults in 2000. I focus on three concepts that help to discern ways in which cancer becomes enmeshed in personal identity — the Delta factor, narrative dissonance and narrative repair.<br>

Issue: i388779<br>

Author(s): von Wright Mats<br>
Abstract: Causal explanations of social actions are central to modern as well as to classic sociology. Even in its revised form. the most influential causal theory -- the covering law theory -- has not proved particularly fruitful for the study of social action. But there are alternative and potentially more fruitful theories. This article presents Weber's methodology and critical realism as two different contributions to a generative view of causality in social science which both try to transcend the protracted controversy between a hermeneutic interpretive sociology and a positivistic causal-explanatory sociology. From the generative standpoint. causal explanations are directed not towards the production of empirical correlations between variables or towards the making of predictions on the basis of empirical laws, but towards the uncovering of causal properties and the processes whereby social actions arise out of the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions. meanings. intentions. social contexts and structures.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i388794<br>
Date: 3 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wilson Henrik<br>
Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: L'étude est centrée sur l'épisode où le Voyageur du temps s'efforce d'arracher sa machine au Sphynx blanc, dans le roman de Wells. Le problème auquel fait face la Voyageur et sa résolution sont lus à la lumière de l'essai de Francis Bacon "Sphinx: or, Science": l'épisode est perçu comme le paradigme des transformations auxquelles l'esprit humain est soumis lorsque les circonstances obligent à employer le savoir non plus de façon contemplative mais dans la pratique. En décrivant cette modification dans la manière de penser et d'agir que Wells prête à son héros, nous accédons à une meilleure compréhension de la façon dont Wells conçoit la science dans le monde moderne et à une redéfinition du récit de Wells comme "roman scientifique."<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the attitude of the Czech literary critic Václav Černý to his fellow critic and compatriot F. X. Šalda, that is to say, Černý's self-stylization, which was defined in polemical reference to Šalda, and also the way Černý 'broadcast' it or concealed it - the primary feature of his technique. Concerning the question of whether literary criticism is a science or an art, the author does not state that Šalda was correct in his Stance against Černý nor, for that matter, that Černý was correct in his against Šalda: the construct of Černý's 'Co je kritika, co není a k čemu je na světě' [What Criticism Is, What It Is Not, and Why It Exists at All] is just as valid as Šalda's claim. The article seeks to demonstrate that in particular it was in his conception of literary criticism that Černý needed to distance himself from Šalda. The fact that Černý could argue for his own method only thanks to Šalda's not having declared criticism a science is only seemingly a paradox. The article also points out parallels between Šalda’s Boje o zítřek and Černý's Osobnost, tvorba a boj, which are interesting particularly for the way the narrow correspondence between the two works then stands out and how Černý in fact barely discussed Šalda at ali. The affinity of the two critics emphasizes how important it was for Černý to stress the difference between himself and his predecessor in the very area in which he was in fact most similar to him.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: In recent times, under the influence of postmodernist thought sociology has largely rejected the idea of social evolution. An exception to this trend is to be found in the work of Jürgen Habermas. Habermas's account of social evolution has received some critical attention, but in sociology wider detail of the picture is not well known. Habermas wishes to hold to the possibility that evolutionary progress can be discerned not only in the sphere of technical control, but also in the sphere of social and moral development. The paper presents Habermas's views on social evoluton within the wider context of his development of critical theory as a 'reconstructive science'. It suggests that his account has been able to resist many of the standard criticisms of evolutionary theory and that a renewal of interest in this area could provide a rich vein of new sociological knowledge.<br>

Abstract: A survey of recent books on Reader-Response, broadly defined as any literary theory that investigates the process of reading. This includes not only books by Norman Holland, Stanley Fish, and Wolfgang Iser, long regarded as central figures in the area of Reader-Response, but also discussions of the contribution to this area made by Jacques Derrida and Mikhail Bakhtin. A widespread reaction is observed against the impersonality of much literary theory and the dangers of reducing reading to a science, but alternative models that stress the therapeutic, self-enhancing, or playful elements in reading are also exposed to critical analysis.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115286<br>
Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors. Das Zeichen als Ausdruck (Husserl) besteht nach F. de Saussure in der unmotivierten Beziehung Bezeichnendes-~<br>

Abstract: La recherche peut-elle être étudiée d'une manière qui n'est ni reconstruction logique, ni psychologie empirique, ni sociologie ? Pratiquement toutes les écoles importantes dans la philosophie contemporaine des sciences répondraient négativement. On esquisse ici une théorie de la recherche qu'on pourrait appeler ' théorie de systèmes ' ou ' praxiologie ' grâce à plusieurs modèles : modèles des facteurs qui gouvernent une entreprise de recherche, qui donnent à une tradition de recherche sa direction. (Ils peuvent être employés pour styliser la Science Normale et les Changements de Paradigme). Les modèles de la dynamique du processus de recherche vus comme une coagence de phases du travail « théoriques » et « empiriques ». (Cela nous aide à comprendre pourquoi des changements de paradigme arrivent normalement de temps en temps). Modèles de critères pour évaluer les résultats de la recherche. On soutient qu'il y a aussi des types de critères pour évaluer les changements de paradigme. (La thèse de l'incommensurabilité est considérée comme une renaissance de la problématique de l'historicisme — relativisme herméneutique). Ensuite les modèles sont employés dans la réflexion sur ellemême de la théorie de la recherche. On conclut avec des remarques sur les relations de la théorie de la recherche et de la philosophie. Can research be studied in a way that is neither logical reconstruction nor empirical psychology or sociology ? Pratically all the important schools in contemporary philosophy of science would answer negatively. In this paper an outline is given of a theory of research which could be called ' systems-theoretical ' or ' praxeological ' by means of several models : Models of the factors that steer a research enterprise, that give a research tradition its direction. (They may be used for stylizing Normal Science and Paradigm Shifts). Models of the dynamics of the research process seen as a coagency of « theoretical » and « empirical » phases of work. They help us t~<br>

Abstract: L'épistémologie d'Émile Meyerson vise à expliquer le réalisme spontané des physiciens en termes anthropologiques. À cette fin, le philosophe met à contribution les ressources des sciences humaines naissantes. Cependant, nous montrons qu'une telle philosophie des sciences y gagnerait à considérer d'autres aspects de l'expérience psychologique et sociale. Eugène Minkowski Arnaud Dandieu et Jacques Lacan — qui se réclament tous des travaux de Meyerson — nous permettent de percevoir une dimension insoupçonnée du principe épistémo logique d'identité, car l'identification des objets, décrite avec tant de précision par Meyerson, est toujours compliquée par l'identification du sujet de la science avec d'autres sujets au sein d'une culture donnée. Emile Meyerson's epistemology aims at explaining the spontaneous physicists' realism in anthropological terms. Consequently, the philosopher uses the resources of the newly born human sciences. Yet, we argue that such a philosophy of sciences would gain at considering other aspects of social and psychological experience. Eugène Minkowski, Arnaud Dandieu et Jacques Lacan — all indebted with Meyerson's work — enable us to perceive an unseen dimension of the epistemological principle of identity : for the identification of objects, so precisely described by Meyerson, is always complicated by the identification of the subject of science with other subjects inside a peculiar culture.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that historical interpretation of the New Testament is necessary to provide information for setting the parameters of valid readings of the New Testament. Such an interpretation serves the purpose of alienation between reader and text and enables the interpreter to ask critical questions about the communicability and relevance of these texts. The nature of the New Testament necessitates historical interpretation. Current historico-critical interpretation of the New Testament is discussed and evaluated with a view to possibilities and limitations in the light of current developments in literary science, history of philosophy and historiography.<br>

Article Title:  Is Information Retrieval in the Arts and Humanities Inherently Different from That in Science? The Effect That ISI®'S Citation Index for the Arts and Humanities Is Expected to Have on Future Scholarship <br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i397056<br>
Date: 1 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Gombrich Eugene<br>
Abstract: Information retrieval in the arts and humanities differs from that in the sciences because the documents required differ in many respects. Nevertheless, the Institute for Scientific Information® has successfully adapted its basic citation indexing system, first used in the "Science Citation Index"®, to its new "Arts & Humanities Citation Index™". Special adaptations of the system to meet the information needs of humanities scholars are discussed. The potential effects of the new index (and resulting data base) are seen as the promotion of interdisciplinary research, accessibility of bibliographic data for sociological and historical studies of humanities scholarship, and more objective methods for evaluating humanities journals.<br>

Article Title: An Epistemological Foundation for Library and Information Science<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i404682<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Molyneux John M.<br>
Abstract: For most of its modern history library and information science has been governed by the mode of thinking best characterized as positivism. This epistemology, shared with most of the social sciences for some time, features the quest for universal laws and the reduction of all phenomena, including behavioral, cognitive, and so on, to the physical, among other elements. This means to knowledge is unworkable for this field; a proposed replacement for it is hermeneutical phenomenology. This article outlines the elements of a revised epistemological approach that seeks an understanding of the essences of things (such as the library) and that takes into account, among other things, the intentional stances of the human actors within the realm of library and information science. Such a re-formed epistemology allows for a different set of questions asked and a different approach to answering them.<br>

Article Title: Instances of Ideology in Discursive Practice: Implications for Library and Information Science<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i397373<br>
Date: 10 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Jonas John M.<br>
Abstract: The growth of knowledge in any discipline depends on discursive practice for the assertion of claims and the assessment of claims. At times, however, that discursive practice may be ideological in nature. Ideology is here defined as being grounded in efforts at domination--the ascendance of some ideas over others. Examination of the incidence of ideology in discourse is necessarily interpretive; part of this article explores the application of hermeneutics to the analysis of discourse. A set of examples of discursive practice in library and information science (LIS), purposely selected, is examined for ideological intent. Ultimately, the aim is to demonstrate that some discourse is ideological in nature and purpose, and to point out the implications of such discursive practice for knowledge growth in LIS.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40123136<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): ARY ANTÓNIO<br>
Abstract: O presente texto surge do desejo de pensar a relação entre direito e ética. O diálogo entre estas duas áreas, sentido como um desafio premente para os dias de hoje, coloca em cena a relação da própria ciência jurídica com a sociedade onde se insere. A teoria da argumentação apresentada por autores como Jürgen Habermas, Chaïm Perelman e Paul Ricoeur permite iluminar de modo renovado esta temática clássica, superando a actual dificuldade em estabelecer uma ligação entre os domínios da ética e do direito. A reflexão parte de um primeiro enquadramento teórico, analisando o confronto histórico entre ética e direito e apontando caminhos de conciliação para a actualidade. Em seguida, apresentam-se algumas concretizações do papel da ética na prática jurídica, pelo seu contributo para a elaboração e aplicação do direito. Por último, o texto aborda possíveis contribuições do direito para a uma construção ética. This paper aims to discuss the relationship between law and ethics. The dialogue between both areas is a pressing and current challenge, which puts into play the relationship of legal science with the society. The theory of argumentation presented by authors such as Jürgen Habermas, Chaim Perelman and Paul Ricoeur, illuminates in a new way this classic issue, overcoming the present difficulties in establishing a link between the fields of ethics and law. The reflection starts with a theoretical framework, which analyzes the historical clash between the two approaches and points out a possible path of reconciliation. Then, it presents some embodiments of the role of ethics in legal practice, for its contribution to the elaboration and application of law. Finally, it discusses some possible contributions of law for the moral discourse.<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Author(s): Gimbel Edward W.<br>
Abstract: In this essay, I argue that a common reading of Max Weber's social science and its treatment of interpretation as either insufficiently or excessively "scientific" on the model of the natural sciences is inadequate. Freed from the either/or opposition of naturalism and humanism, and read through the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Weber can be read as offering a way forward for the social sciences that embraces both the subjective orientation of social scientists and the objective aspirations of social science.<br>

Abstract: Animal experience is central to the fiction of J.M. Coetzee and Franz Kafka. In light of new approaches to animal awareness in science and philosophy, this essay investigates how Coetzee's deliberations on the animal, initially by way of Kafka, extend the range of narrative authority and reappraise human empathy.<br>

Issue: i40170926<br>

Author(s): Sakr Michel<br>
Abstract: Cet article trouve son point de départ dans l'analyse du caractère sévère de Jésus dans l'évangile. Des synoptiques, c'est Matthieu qui met le plus l'accent sur la tension entre les pharisiens et Jésus. Le point culminant est le discours dans le temple dont le noyau est constitué des sept « Ouai » (Mt 23,13-36). Pour expliquer cette sévérité, nous utilisons comme approche méthodique la « pragmatique » de la science de la communication et de la linguistique. L'objectif de la recherche est d'offrir une nouvelle perception de la réalité et d'interpeller sur l'agir moral. This article begins from the analysis of the harsh nature of Jesus in the Gospel. Among the Synoptics, it is Matthew who insists the most on the strain between the Pharisees and Jesus. Its culmination is Jesus' speech in the Temple, at whose centre are the seven "Woes" (Matt. 23 :13-36). To explain this harshness, we will make use of the methodical approach called "pragmatic", in communication science and linguistics. Our aim is to offer a new perception of reality and to challenge to moral action.<br>

Author(s): Bühler Pierre<br>
Abstract: Comme son sous-titre l'indique, cet article a pour but de développer un contrepoint au livre de Pierre Gisel qui fait l'objet du débat présenté dans ce numéro. En dialogue critique avec cet ouvrage, il tente de formuler une autre manière de concevoir la théologie aujourd'hui. Après avoir explicité les conditions et la base d'accord de ce dialogue, il reprend successivement la question de la définition de la théologie, le problème des rapports entre théologie et sciences des religions et les difficultés liées à la relecture des héritages, pour se terminer par une évaluation globale du projet de Pierre Gisel. As indicated by its sub-title, this article develops an objection to the book of Pierre Gisel, subject of the debate in the present edition. In critical dialogue, it tries to formulate a different way of conceiving theology today. After exposing the conditions and basis for agreement in this debate, it takes up in succession the question of the definition of theology, the problem of the relationships between theology and the science of religions and the difficulties linked to the re-reading of traditions, finishing with a global evaluation of the project of Pierre Gisel.<br>

Abstract: This introduction of the HSR Special Issue on "Critique and Social Change: Historical, Cultural, and Institutional Perspectives" addresses the question of how critique and social change are interrelated. Conflicts and disputes are considered to be a major source of critique. We distinguish three types of conflicts: (1) Value conflicts result from the ongoing process of rationalization and the differentiation of relatively autonomous "value spheres" (Weber) such as politics, economy, science, law, etc. (2) The growth and expansion of these value spheres, e.g. the growth of capitalism, in turn produce new forms of inequalities and leads to distributional conflicts. (3) As questions of distribution and inclusion are closely linked, critique also originates from identity conflicts, which address the social recognition of individuals and collectivities. In order to understand how critique is related to social change, we suggest that critique can be studied either as a condition for or as an effect from social change. Based on this distinction we provide an overview over the contributions of this volume.<br>

Article Title: Milton's God and the Matter of Chaos<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219828<br>
Date: 10 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Watkins John<br>
Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: Many anthropologists argue that human affairs are subjective and therefore outside the realm of empirical science. While this position is based on important observations about the process of understanding human affairs, the arguments employed do not imply that the application of empirical science to the explanation of human affairs is either impossible or inappropriate, as some critics maintain.<br>

Issue: i228006<br>
Date: 7 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Selzer Greg<br>
Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i228033<br>
Date: 4 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Suchman G. Michael<br>
Abstract: To date, little is known about when and to what degree science students begin to participate in authentic scientific graphing practices. This article presents the results of a series of studies on the production, transformation, and interpretation of graphical representation from Grade 8 to professional scientific practice both in formal testing situations (inside) and in the course of field/laboratory work (outside). The results of these studies can be grouped into two major areas. First, there is a discontinuity in the graph-related practices that marks a boundary between people who engage in work that requires them to transform data into graphical representations (converted) and people who do not have such experiences (cannibals). Second, the didactic practices of high school textbooks and university lectures exhibit a marked discontinuity relative to graphing practices in scientific journals. Graphs used in didactic circumstances may be associated with students' difficulties in interpreting "real data." It appears that school teachers and university professors (missionaries) do little to put their students on trajectories of increasing participation in authentic scientific graphing practices.<br>

Abstract: Graph-related practices are central to scientific endeavors, and graphing has long been hailed as one of the core "general process skills" that set scientists apart. We use two case studies from a large study among scientists to exemplify our findings that graphing is not a context-independent skill. Rather, scientists' competencies with respect to graph interpretation are highly contextual and are a function of their familiarity with the phenomena to which the graph pertains. If graphing practices are not general but are tied to embodied understandings and familiarity with representation practices, then there are implications for teaching graphing in school mathematics and science settings.<br>

Abstract: Summary: On the Relations between the Sociology and the Semiology of Music. The aim of this article is to inquire what relations are possible between the semiology and the sociology of music. The first section attempts a definition of semiology: it may be understood as the science of signs, as the use of linguistic models in the description of non-linguistic fields, or as a programme of research specific to the humanities and the social sciences which distinguishes between the aspects of production, reception and the immanence of the meaning in question. The second section, through a critical analysis of a text by Barthes, explores the question of whether semiology can be understood as the science of musical ideologies. It demonstrates that semiology has no specific methodology with which to meet these problems. The third section investigates the possibility of using semiology to assist in reconciling musical and social structures. After briefly recalling several positions on this subject, we suggest that the 'neutral level' of description, presented above as one of the elements of semiological analysis, can serve as a necessary preliminary to the harmonising of musical with social structures.<br>

Abstract: ‘The action turn’ stands over against ‘the linguistic turn’ that was a development in Western philosophy during the 20th century. Its most important characteristic is its focus on philosophy and language. Ludwig Wittgenstein’s influence is strong as the term follows from his claim that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language and his later comments on language games.

Abstract: Résumé. L'un des principaux problèmes dans la controverse entourant le recensement détaillé concernait la relation entre la science et la politique. En analysant les arguments et les hypothèses sous-jacentes de quatre interventions influentes et exemplaires faites au nom de la science, cet article rend un constat normatif de cette relation. Il nuance les idéaux protecteurs de la science que les critiques ont invoqués et avance que de telles ressources conceptuelles sont nécessaires pour protéger la science d'un empiètement politique indu. Cependant, dans leur zèle à défendre les droits de la science, les critiques en ont réclamé plus que nécessaire, ce qui a occulté la dimension de la valeur des décisions politiques et n'a pas respecté le rôle de la politique en tant que point légitime de prise de décision sur les questions de valeur. Un constat normatif adéquat de la relation entre la science et la politique dans la politique gouvernementale doit non seulement protéger la science contre la politique, mais aussi la politique contre la science.<br>

Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>

Abstract: In a similar critique of language and consumerism, in
         Whole Foods, Marie Buck playfully fuses language from the company's website, an anarchist zine, and etymological dictionaries, so that “the hybrid form ofWhole Foodscontrasts with the grocer's rhetoric of uncorrupted organic wholeness and natural unmediated authenticity.”
               Her poems play on culinary exoticism and the branding and marketing of food products to indicate privilege and access: “Cheeses often reflect the character of their country of origin, so experimenting with different cheese can be a kind of exploration of a faraway place” (“Cheese”).118
            
               In one poem titled “Authenticity,” Buck incorporates what appear to be instructions for caring for fruit with intimations about the process of poetic making: “Cutting and exposure to the air darkens the flesh. We stood in unheated squats having tooth and not being limp. We were more art than science. We gently rubbed our skin in a circular motion.”119
            
               The process of slicing and selecting brings about a transformation that is “more art than science” in this self-reflective poem. But more immediately, “Authenticity” also calls to mind the exposé concerning Whole Foods cofounder John P. Mackey, who used a pseudonym to post more than 1,100 entries about his own company on Yahoo! Finance bulletin boards between 1999 and 2006. The food mogul's posts were often self-serving: “I like Mackey's haircut. I think he looks cute,” one 28 April 2000 post read. “You must not patronize any of WFMI's stores. Tattoos, piercings, unusual dress and interesting haircuts are everywhere in the stores. In comparison, Mackey looks like a model for Brooks Brothers!”120
            
               The hypertrophied falseness of the supermarket comes to a head in Mackey's (im)posturing.121<br>

Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Bob Scharff and Ed Casey can talk about Northwestern, where they were students. I can say a bit about Yale, since I was a graduate student there. Many of my teachers were resisting the analytic onslaught. There were scholars of Hume and Kant (Charles Hendel and George Schrader); metaphysicians in the grand Whiteheadian mode (Paul Weiss and Nathaniel Lawrence); Brand Blanchard, a late advocate of a sort of Bradleyian idealism; and students of American Pragmatism like John Smith and Richard Bernstein. All soldiered on, in an atmosphere in which what they were doing was considered nonsense. But Carl Hempel and Arthur Pap and Charles Stevenson had also been at Yale, followed by Wilfred Sellars and Norwood Russell Hanson. It proved to be a combustible mixture, and when I returned from a Fulbright year in Paris, in 1963, a major blowup had occurred. Sellars and two gifted logicians, Alan Anderson and Nuell Belknap, had decamped to the unlikely destination of Pittsburgh, where they and others founded a major center of analytic philosophy and philosophy of science. And John Wild had come to Yale from Northwestern. Russ Hanson took himself out, tragically, by flying his World War II biplane into a mountain—he was a stunt pilot in his spare time. George Schrader, who became my
      Doktorvater, had discovered Heidegger in Germany. Others were tolerant, if not partisans, like John Smith and Richard Bernstein. That left Yale as one of the centers of Continental philosophy, at least for a while. It remained combustible, however. Talk about a slaughter bench! The Bernstein tenure case of 1964, ostensibly about publish or perish, brought out student demonstrators and made the national press. Over the next ten years many innocent lambs were led to that particular slaughter bench, up to and including members of this very panel. The Yale administration, suffering from an inferiority complex and unwilling to be different, couldn't stand to be told it was out of line with Harvard and ~<br>

Abstract: An early SPEP paper by Earle made a strong impression on me in this regard—though not, I think, in quite the way he intended.
      
            He argued that our fledgling movement seemed to be developing a dual personality. On the one hand, we seemed to be trading in the traditional metaphysics of human nature for a rigorous Husserlian science of human life's “essentials”; and on the other hand, we were producing an existentialist excess of “ontological autobiographies” that glorified various purely contingent and accidental senses of how life might be lived. But surely Earle's dualism was too traditional to capture what we all wanted to say both about the human condition “in general”11
         andabout the unique possibilities open to every individual. Indeed, Earle himself was especially hard on those who tried to avoid sayinganythingtoo generally, for fear they might objectify life's deepest dimensions, oranythingtoo specifically, lest it be taken as merely philosophical special pleading. What, he demanded, do twoExistenzentalk about? To be struck dumb by this question would be to betray one's possessing a very unphenomenological allegiance to an objectivist conception of language.<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: But are there new philosophies of technology? In my narrative I have implied my own style of a “postphenomenology,” which today is practiced by a significant number of younger philosophers—I would include here Peter Paul Verbeek, Evan Selinger, Robert Rosenberger, and many others who have presented and published “empirical turn studies.” Hans Achterhuis describes this concrete turn very well in
                  American Philosophy of Technology: The Empirical Turn(2001). Andrew Feenberg, himself an interpreter and critic of both Heidegger and Marcuse, has done his own analyses of new technologies. And in Europe, a social scientist-philosopher, actually more cited than Derrida, Bruno Latour is known for his distinctive “actor network theory” of analysis. And Donna Haraway must be added for her biology-centered work as well. I mention these movements in passing to show that the field has already changed and all of these are “Continental” in heritage. Indeed, the field is much larger, and “technoscience studies” are engaged in by the new sociologies of science, feminist studies of science, and many emergent cultural studies now proliferating in both Europe and America. Here, however, I did not want to do a field survey but, rather, take note of our own responses to technologies from the SPEP anniversary.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: The next section, “Rethinking Science with Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Meillassoux,” consists of two articles that revisit aspects of the critique of scientism in nineteenth- and twentieth-century continental philosophy. Joshua Rayman's article, “Nietzsche on Causality,” contests the reading of Nietzsche as a scientific naturalist that is currently popular in Nietzsche studies. Rayman argues that this reading fails to appreciate the radical entailments of Nietzsche's critique of causality, which lies at the heart of his critiques of metaphysics and of the natural sciences. In his article, “Knowing, Counting, Being: Meillassoux, Heidegger, and the Possibility of Science,” Robert Gall responds to Quentin Meillassoux's influential critique of post-Kantian philosophy. Considering the work of Heidegger in detail, Gall argues that Heidegger's work provides ample resources for responding to Meillassoux's critique and that his emphasis on the priority of ontology in philosophy allows us to give a more comprehensive account of science than does Meillassoux's proposed return to a precritical style of philosophizing.<br>

Abstract: Discussions of health these days, in both popular and academic discourse, are increasingly turning toward the concept of sustainability. Indeed, interdisciplinary academic programs as well as institutes and foundations dedicated to “sustainability studies” have sprung up around the world, ambitiously seeking to connect global politics, economics, and environmentalism. They proceed from the assumption that the capacity to endure demands a long-range, integrated vision of social justice, economic equity, and ecological health, necessitating cooperation among individuals in the humanities, the sciences, and corporate industry. A recent essay in
      American Literary Historyentreats ecocritics to abjure the “retreat to the bower, the plough, or the graduate seminar, issuing the same familiar jeremiads against science and industrial capitalism, [in] recognition that sustainability studies in the humanities is the natural companion of sustainability science, not its antagonist.”
            While he is guilty at times of stultifying pigheadedness about science, considering the ecological grounding of his wide-view epidemiology, Shaw certainly thought in these epic terms and sought solutions to those very challenges. From27
         Major BarbaratoFarfetched Fables, Shaw displays his attentiveness to a program of health in which scientists, industrialists, political leaders, and scholars commit to (repurposing Andrew Undershaft's line) “looking after the drainage.”<br>

Abstract: To sum up, hope and faith are crucial to human wellness, singly and in the aggregate; they are, in this respect, salutary virtues. Both are indispensable to the species' prospects for flourishing, but in the ordinary course of events, neither is indestructible. Each can wane, to one degree or another; and, in extremis, each may succumb to the experientially insurmountable. And when one expires, the other loses its efficaciousness in the process. In theory, faith is simultaneously source, foundation, and trigger whereas hope is at once derivative, dependent, and active. Without faith, hope fades to nothingness, and so too does living, leaving the race impoverished at every level. The hopeless, if they survive at all, live grim, stunted, and joyless lives. Without a therapeutic intervention, the prognosis for the hopelessly morose is bleak: unrelenting gloom, or worse. Hope—be it cognitively or emotionally based, or mixed—is the anticipation of future goods, and faith is the conviction that future goods can be realized. Faith has multiple sources, among them religion, science, esteemed others, or the self, no one of which is necessarily infallible or unconditionally trustworthy. Hence, the faith-hope nexus may exist in a healthy or a pathological state, depending on whether the forward-looking gaze is tied to objective actuality, escapist idealism, or distortive ideology. If eyes are irrevocably fixed in the wrong direction, wishes are bound to be disappointed and harm, on a grand scale, may be the result. Yet even if faith, as well as any correlative hope it generates, is firmly grounded in reality, there is no guarantee of success. Things go awry, for a variety of reasons, some predictable, some not. Faith, then, is always a wager, and a risky, sometimes perilous, one at that. Faith can stumble, fail, or disintegrate, extinguishing in its demise any lingering vestiges of hope.<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Abstract: James Joyce appears to be attempting a vision that balances the comedic optimism of Wells's
         Modern Utopiawith the historical realism ofAnticipationsandThe Shape of Things to Come(while at the same time eschewing the irretrievable fantasization of the former text and the impending dystopianism of the latter texts). Joyce roots his Utopianism in a sense of material reality that often inscribes a satire upon that Utopianism within the Utopianist position. Joyce was clearly not as averse as Wells to the festering people of the abyss and the corporeal sensuality of their lives; indeed, in response to Wells's complaints of olfactory indulgence, Joyce wrote: “There once was an author named Wells / Who wrote about science not smells.”
               Indeed, in 1928, Wells wrote to Joyce delineating their differences: “The frame of my mind is a world wherein a big unifying and concentrating process is possible…. Your mental existence is obsessed by a monstrous system of contradictions.”36

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Before Utopia can be recuperated for architecture, the commonly referenced sources for the decline of utopian thought in architecture frequently rehearsed in the historiography of twentieth-century modern architecture and theory must be interrogated. In most stories, rejection of Utopia is explained causally as a consequence of what amounts to architectural hubris from the “18th century to the late 1960s.” Accordingly, by the 1960s the impossibility of deterministic architectural social science (misconstrued as Utopia) to ever deliver on its promises of improvement (the project of modern architecture) was revealed as not simply improbable but ultimately impossible—a diversion away from the supposedly
         realproblems of development. As architectural historian and theorist Anthony Vidler observes: “The crisis of utopia/utopian thinking [in architecture] was brought about by the architects' vision that utopia could be designed and planned.”

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>

Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>
